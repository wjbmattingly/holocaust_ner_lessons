But, I was brought up by the incubel (ph). We had a maid, with whom I spoke only Czech and my pa rents spoke only Czech with me for the purpose of, that's why Czech is my mother tongue because they said, "German you'll always learn, but you should speak Czec h." And so I was brought up by the incubel (ph). Q: So how old were you when, this, your uncle, had this effect on y ou? Were you still a child? A: I was four years old.

Yes, but I had been before at the Zionist Congress in Carlsbad in about 1920 with my father, ___________ ___ nearby in Marinebarton (ph) and I, before all of this was going on in Jewish matters. They asked that Jewi sh _____________ be ascribed to and my father told me stories about I was very fascinated as he turned it into stories about what happened to the other 10 tribes. Q: Right. So, in Vienna, to go ahead to the early 1930's, of course, in January, 1933, Hitler comes to power in Germany. How did th at affect your Zionist activities? A: Well, you must know I had belonged before to Zionist Student, Student Fraternity, but it was not academic students, it was not ye t at a university. It was in a gymnasium. And it was ____________, but Zionis m in Vienna had a very strong l ook and national Je wish component, because it was led by Robert (ph) Schlecker (ph), Robert Schlecker wa s the leader of the Olsten (ph) Jews and he was a good friend of my uncle, Siegmund Korn (ph), because both had been very good student at First Zionist Congress ____________ from Bruno (ph) in Mora via and my uncle from Prague and they continued their contact in Vienna, so I was some how all this in the group which had student ____________.

So, but afte r Hitler's rise to power... A: Yeah. Q: Did you feel, I mean, was your Zionist ac tivities strengthened? 4 A: Yeah, but I was before this already very much in the Jewish Student Movement. I was in the Jewish Academic _________ _____ Israel, that was one of the co rporations which had been Zionist from the beginning of Zionism and I had, yesterday only I got a postcard I think it's not a postcard, I think it is a photocopy of Heffa (ph) in which he writes to __ _____________Israel , "To my dear corporation Israel" and to fratern ities they are very different to fr aternities here. They are a small group, usually not more than 10 or 12 at the most, would have to be accepted by unanimous vote and I was very much in this frater nity. This was a dueling fraternity . I fought two duels from quite old times (ph). Here you can still see a little bit, but most of this is gone. I fought two duels in my, in my student times. And this was all very much ____ Jewish affairs. I was at Vienna investigated by the University of Vienna for having started a riot there. Which I really did one, once. Q: What year was that? A: That was about 1928 or '29, probably '29. Every Saturday, the Jewish older frat ernities went on a boomer (ph) on the parade (ph) to the univers ity ____________ everyone had a place where they stood and the Jewish students, national fraternities to which the ____ was one, the second oldest, the oldest was Fatima (ph) after whom a saint was recently named, Jerusalem, then Fatima had a place, too, and from time to ti me the German students, the nationalist fraternity, stood next to us, they started to beat us and to throw us out of the univers ity and before this happened every time they sung a certain song and then after they sung it, they kicked us out . And once you knew only from the atmosphere that it was to happen before they started the so ng and once when they were close to starting the song, I then walked up there and said, "I want to speak to your leader" and said, as soon as I came to him, I was brought to him and said I had to leave a message from the Jewish student organizations, bang-then I hit him very hard whic h, of course, immediately that I was grabbed and beaten and kicked out, but the fight developed in the university and we were all thrown out as we usually were, but at that time it wa s not that you risked your lives, they just beat you. Once only at such a riot a man was ba dly injured and this was the son of Sigmund Freud, Martin Freud was his name. He became a lawyer. He was badly injured at on e of those fights and I was accused of having starting the riot at the univ ersity just so, but the others had started the riots and I usually 5 would not, they would throw us out anyhow, so I started it. And this is very interesting political ____________, the r ector(ph), the do you director, too? Q: Yeah. A: Director of the Univ ersity, Paxton (ph) Manificos(ph) was exchanged from year to year from one faculty to the other was at th at time the initver (ph), the name was I-N-I-T-V-E-R, and he was a theologian. He was applied by th e theologian faculty and he was a priest and he was ____and I told him, "You don't think that I woul d be crazy to start a fight; how many are we and how many are the others?" And of the newspapers in Vienna, they are largely in Jewish hands and liberal, very liberal, and they looked out for th e chance to hear to have the dire ctor of the university who was a theologian and he was then finally called to this panel and he announced that I am being warned. That was all. I could have been excluded from the university ___________ ___, because he had told me, I had told him, "You know that you really don' t start this" and he sai d, "____ I don't know.ﬂ Well, he was very mild (ph) an d the journalists were waiting outside for me to come out with accusations toward the Director and I told them he was a nice man, he has a very liberal attitude so this makes a nice story, too. So they had a big stor y that a priest who is not radical and who is most pleasant sort and had very good press and shortly afte r that the Olsten (ph) party formed a coalition to look for a Minister of Social Welfare and they got him because he was accepted to the liberal school. I think this has something to do with my, with my____ until I was mentioned by the____ and he became Minister of Social Welfare and he was one of the Olsten Provision (ph) government and then they told the Cardinal of Vienna died and he was well -liked by everybody, that they made him, the Pope made him Cardinal for Vienna, but he behaved very badly, well, the, the Nazis came in and he was the first one to turn to the Nazis and publish a poster, "Heil Hitler," which he agreed very much with the regi me. Q: Let me ask you, during these early years, did you at any time think of settling in Palestine? A: The event (ph), which is just what I wanted to emphasize, Zionism was very much of a national minority that is you _______ _____ of it, primary understanding fo r national minority, so the Jews were very satisfied that the League of Nations had adopted a law for protection of minorities and 6 this vision was that the Viennese Jews in their mass (ph) were leas t protected by these Jews very conscious of their Jewish culture. Q: So, how specifically did you get involve d specifically with th e Betar movement and revisionism, which is obviously a very logical specific type of Zionism? A: There was at this time a discussion going on whether the Jewish, whether Zionism was really a state or was it a strong movement that we want a bi-national unit at the time and those people, and I knew about it and I was always radi cal. I was for the state and by then I went into the Congress, I went for the first time in 1935 to Israel when I was...1935, I wa s 29 years old. I went to Israel, but before this 1935 I went to the Cong ress in Zurich (ph). Aisha (ph) was a friend of mine. And then I heard Gobutinski's (ph) speech. But I heard him, then I formally joined, like I had heard him already in Catovitz (ph), which was a revisionist _____ ________ a few years before this, as I was very much impressed. He was a most impressive personality. I knew him well. A book came out recently by Shotz (ph) in __________ ____ manages very permanently (ph). Q: What was it about Gobutinski that im pressed you, that type of Zionism? A: No, it was not only the Zionism, it was the personality. He was an excellent orator and then he came to Vienna. Everybody went to hear him. He didn't advertis e what he's talking about. They had a big placard that said, "Go butinski's Speech", "Gobutinski __ ____________.ﬂ And that was enough to have people come there. And he is not only, I don' t think he could give it a specific name. Half of Zionism seems (ph) one and the Jewish stat e. Q: Did your activities intensify between...after 1933 ? I mean you were very active well before 1933, but then, when Hitler came to power, at the time did you see that as a seminal event at the time? A: I don't remember what I thought at the time. But I was very active in the Jewish community. The Jewish community has been a assimilical (ph) community with the old people coming to well-to-do Jews who are running it and after that __________ __. Many not-well-to-do poor Jews from the East came in as refugees from the Russian advance and they formed the majority finally of the Viennese Jews and I was act ive in the viacom (ph) in the fight, in the fight, for ge tting elected into this Jewish community. The Jewish community was something en tirely different than it is here or 7 anywhere. By law, incorporation to which every Jew belongs whether they wanted to or not. And to put, they tax you. If you didn't pay your tax to the Jewish community, the tax ____________ of the government taxed your property. They had very officious tact ics, this Jewish community. There was only one way to get out, to declare ousted (ph) of the ______________; "I don't want to be a Jew any more," and you were not in the Jewi sh community. So the Jewish community was really direct presentation of th e Jews and I was very active for, for the Zionists, for Zionists who finally got the majority. Q: Now when did you begin to, with the issue of emigration what was termed illegal emigration. How did you arrive at that as a so lution? How did you come to that? A: When Hitler came to power in Germany, the refugees come over from Germany to Vienna, mainly well-to-do people, and they were in Vienna and their children sometimes had the desire to go to Palestine and they couldn't get visas, certif icates from Betar (ph). The Betar (ph) was the strongest Jewish organization in Vienna and you couldn't get any number of certificates ____________. You know emigration was very limited by ability and the people of the leftist organization, of the liberal group, they got most of the certificate s, but the Betar didn't get enough certificates. so one day I was in my office just as I described here , I was a lawyer, and a man came in and said, "I have a message from Dr. Wolfgang ____________ , who was a Viennese Zionist from an old Vienna fami ly, a nobility, which was very rare for Jews and his message was, "Bill, Willy, listen to this man, he has something interesting to sa y", and he suggested that we, he said I have some contact with...he was a Palestinian Jewish Patriot Adventurer, he was a real adventurer, and he said that I have contact with underground in Gr eece and I suggested following it, rent a boat from these people. Q: This is 1937? A: This was 1936, that we...could have been '3 5. That we rent a boat from them and put our batterime (ph) on it and for people who really want to emigrate and on the way to supposedly going to the Vierra De Tripoli (ph). We really wanted them to be __________ ____ as a very rich and well-to-do, a center of power, a country should be run (ph) and there was mu ch propaganda to go to 8 the Vierra De Tripoli (ph) and he said, "We ride the boat to go to the Vierra De Tripoli (ph)?" But if we don't come to the Vierra De Tripoli, it was only the batterime (ph) will force the ____ to go to Palestine instead and there will be a big stinking develop because Jews from good houses that pilot the ship and go to... Q: You wanted the publicity... A: We wanted the publicity in order to point out to the world that in spite of the need to, a land to go to, in spite of what the League of Nations has decided on the stre ngth of ____________ that this should be a Jewish nation alone, Palestine, that this is not being done. And.. Q: Was this successful? A: This is what was suggested to me. His name was Shriebelst ein (ph) G-R-I-V-O-L-H-E-I-N (ph) Moshe Grivolhein, Galinin. He changed his to Ga linin (ph), and I saw a di fferent ____. I said, "This propaganda is very good, but we can do better. We can bring the people in and try to smuggle (ph) them in." He said ther e would be no problem with the _____________ because the problem being in the ____________of this ____________, so try to smuggle (ph) them in but you're going to help us to smuggle them in and we'll smuggle them in once, twice, three times until they catch us; then we will have the publicity, and in the meanwh ile, ____ you people into Israel. And he agreed to that. This is when we started organizing the first two transports; we did not get enough people to go with the first one, the people were scared to go... Q: So you had to convince people to... A: Well, I was a lawyer. I would be able to smuggle them. There was not so much need yet. And so I traveled to Eastern Slovakia, Topachkarusha, Russia (ph) it was called, it was part of Slovakia and there the policy was very great about the Jews and from there you go up to Tareem (ph) to some ____________ I think on ly two or three batterime (ph) from Vi enna of the first 16 people, 15 or 16 that had transports, I have the number here, which ____________ to Palestine. Independent of this, which I did not know that Gobutinski had called at one of his articles for breakings of the rules of the British persuasions and to make illegal propaganda and to make it a Jewish spot, but it was already, it had happened. 9 Q: What part did they leave from in Europe? A: Different... Q: Different. A: Different parts. First you ca me by train to Greece and then le ft from Athens, but the problem was that the British demonstrated, the British government demonstrated, with the governments of those countries, that they supported by letting the Jews in. But we needed, they said, "How do you know ____illegally into Palestine?" They said, "Becau se they don't have a visa to go anywhere to.ﬂ So, we had a man, Dr. Diamand, a ve ry educated scholar, who told us, we formed a small group, The Axion (ph), who was the active action group within the revisioni st party, about five or six people, and he told us, "You know the danube is in ternational, it is an international treaty about the danube that you can go down the danube without visa to the seaport, becaus e Britain now intervenes with all these countries, with Slovakia, with Hungary, with Yugo slavia, Bulgaria, Romania, that they shouldn't let our ships through. Well, our ships went throug h without problems, without visa, so we went down the da nube until they came with and we did not know, generall y assumed, and I am always asked, "How did you get out?" It was no problem to get out; the pr oblem was to get in! The problem with all of them is the very end, then the problem to get out, of course, it was not possible to get out anymore, because at the same time it was closed, the borders were closed and it was after the Panzer (ph) conferen ce and you can't get out anymore. Q: Clearly, in the 1930's which we're talking about now, so you' re saying the problem wasn't leaving Europe, the problem was nowhere to go, who would ac cept Jewish refugees at the time. A: The Germans helped the people travel up in German ____________ do wn the danube with us about 1500 miles I think, so all this ____ to the German ships flying the Nazi fl ag and they are loaded with refugees and turn in Galas (ph), which is over in th e Donow (ph) Delta, in the Delta where the Donow gets into the Black Sea and Galla s (ph), which was the biggest ____ port ____ which is already on the ocean and Tunashavesha l (ph), which is a small place, which I was informed that Nazis traveled to the grave (ph) ships. 10 Q: And when you talk about, when you mentioned, you referred before to the Jewish pirates, did they literally force th e ships to go to... A: No. The plan was ch anged. The plan was changed. Th ey smuggled ____________ course and the ____________ was a seagoing ship to little boats and the first ships there was nothing on it, no arrangement had been made on the land. They just jumped into the water and fought around, just jumped into the water and swam the little place intending to look for Jewish places where they could hide, but soon the ____ took over the distribution. Q. Right, so, so the fi rst few transports were, in fact, successful? A. Very successful, because we boated people out. We didn't have so many. Q. When was the first time a ship was caught, I mean, by the British, you know, at Palestine? A. I believe the first ship whic h was caught was at Pareta (ph). Pareta was on the high seas and could not land nowhere. The British had organized and they came too near the border and the British Navy was there and the Air Force, the British Air Force and they blocked their advance so they retreated at Pareta (ph) to some barely __ __________ little Greek Isla nds, inlets, in the sea there and seen some __________ ____ and so on and then they got out and they couldn't get through. Well, the Pareta (ph) beach was not run by __________ ___ because it was ____________ representative from _____________. [end of side one, tape one] Q: This a continuation of the U. S. Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with William Perl. This is tape number one, side B. A: Okay. I had spoken of the Pareta, you asked me the first ship which was caught. I am not sure any more, but the Pareta was one of the first ships... Q: Now was that at the beginning of the war, th e Pareta was around...? A: It was not war yet, it was the fall of 1937, it was the summer of 1939. Q: So it was right before the war? A: Very shortly before the war. Q: I'd like to go back to 1938... 11 A: Okay. Q: And the Aunschluss ( ph) and that day and the period follow ing it, do you reme mber that day? A: That morning I was in the house of a friend of mine for a sabbath meal Friday evening when we knew all the time that the situation was very dang erous for us there and there was a notice that the Russian (ph) chancellor had received an ultima tum from Germany for complete surrender and Churchill went on the radio while we were eating just after the lighting of th e candles and said that he had gotten an ultimatum from Ge rmany to surrender and he does not want to shed blood and that is why he surrenders and______________ that was, that was it. Q: And, after the Aunschluss ( ph), did your Zionist activities or activities related to emigration, did they intensify even more, did you... A: Everybody first tried to get ou t. Not everybody, but very many tried to get out and went to the borders and the borders, they are closed. Within the 48 hours the borders were closed. The first people, particularly the Hungarian and Czech border s, which are very close, they are both close and the people who try to escape, they were arrested because _____________ to tr y to escape and were in trouble. Especia lly in trouble, everyone was in trouble. And, but some very inventive people did not go to these near borders, they went to the far borders of Austria, but Marx (ph) did not go yet, the Viennese Jews, the Austrian Jews, prac tically all of them lived in Vienna. They went to the ____________ (ph); they went to the Italian border and went into Italy. Dr. Edmund Schechter (ph), who was one of the leaders of the Revisionist organization, he was out that first night because he, instead of going to the border, to the nearest border, he went to a far border and see they still don't know yet about the stream of refugees. And he got in. And Dr. Wolfhef Hofive r (ph) went to the French soldiers, so from Germany to the Fr ench border, so he got out. Q: Was there an intensificatio n of arrests of Jews immediatel y following the Aunschluss (ph)? A: Sure, sure. The same night already there are people arrested, a few, bu t the next day more are arrested, but there are all still Nazis. This was on early Friday, on Sunday the Gestapo moved in, officially till Monday they would be already started. Q: Were the Zionists targeted? Did you feel especially afraid being your Zionist activities? 12 A: The first day Nazis went to the houses of th e members of the leaders of the community and they arrested the president of the community, Dr. Davidof (ph) Friedm an, who perished, was killed. They arrested Dr. Yachov Ehrlich (ph), who was th e, represented, only the regional representative of the Vienna City Council and he was brought to Dachau and four or five da ys later, there was listed the Viennese community got a letter from th e Jewish community in Munich that, "We have the remains of Dr. Yachov Ehrlich, who died in the concentration ca mp at Dachau. If you want to have the remains, will you please send, tell us ____________ to..." and then everybody knew that this means business. Q: Now you were summoned to the office of Eichmann... A: I was actually not summoned. I went there because there was older leaders of the organization were summoned to the office, to the Zionist organization's office, which was in the Marcraurel (ph), after the Roman Emperor who founde d the City of Vienna, Marcraurel (ph), I think the houses the Zionist offices. And there the leaders were summoned there. But the leaders _____________ had fled. _____________ and Wolfhef Hofiver (ph) ha d fled and I was one of th e, the three people who were at that time in charge of the Revisionist organization. But they didn't inform me, but I went there. Q: Why did you go to Eichmann? A: To meet him, to repr esent the Revisionists, because the other two had run. Q: Why did you try to...what did you say to Eichma nn? What was... A: I have had this prepared fo r you. I might have given it to you already, the memorandum which started the whole thing. I told Eichmann, first of all Eichmann asked me, I didn't have to say anything. He asked me several questions which showed me that he knows conditions in Israel. He asked me about ____ and so, and he asked me, "How about that Diamand (ph), where is Diamand?" I do not know Diamand. I said, "Who is Diamand?" He said, "D iamand who organized the bulk up (ph) of German Jews in Belgium an d Poland." I said, "I do not know about him." They put me on the wall (ph), towards the wall with the face toward the wall and said, "Now I want to know who, where Diamand is and what you know about him." 13 Q: He was threatening y our life if you didn't... A: What? Q: Was he threatening your life if you didn't? A: Sure, he put his gun in to my (cough), into my ba ck and said, "I'll give y ou a second, a second..." How did he put it? He said, "I'll give you a second naber (ph)." And I didn't, he didn't count down yet. And he said, "Now, I'll count down to thr ee and if you don't tell me about where Diamand is and where I can find him, I'll give you, I'll make you a second asshole," a nd he went a little lower with his rifle, with his gun, which was not a rifle, it was a pistol. And I really did not know him. So I told him, I did some fast thinking, but I was full with fear. I told him, "I don't know about Diamand, but I can tell you something which is much more impo rtant for you. It is political information about the possib ility of ____________ Jewish organizing emigration.ﬂ Q: So he was receptive? A: He was receptive. He went and he was interested in other me mbers of the Betar (ph) who were _____________ Erick Deut sch, who was my best friend. Erick Deutsch and I and two or three members of the Betar went with him after he had ___ _ and we stayed with hi m already. We weren't allowed to leave. Went in his car, not in his car, the poli ce van, to the office of the Revisionist organization. And there, you know, they were not very organized yet at the time. And we had been organizing the bulk of German groups, more than anybody else, more than this Diamand and Erick Deutsch had taken older materials referred to the bulk up (ph) German groups and put it into the stairwell at the entrance of that, but the Jew who was around it to pack it was being arrested right away. And he put it out there and they searched the whole office and didn't find it, much about the ____________ bulk up (ph) of German groups (ph). If this is okay, I would say something which is very interesting. In ____this bulk up (ph) of German groups which started, was started by Gobutinski (ph) right after Germany came to power and the Revisionists were very active, but the Americans were getting into it, too. Gobutinski gave a speech in Bradislav (ph). I came to Vienna and Bradislav is now the capital of Slovakia and was a rather small city, but with a strong Jewish population about 60 miles from Vienna and he gave speech there and we went there all together to 14 listen to him. And he said, "The Germans want e quality. We should not give them equality. They want equality of ar ms; they want equality of fr eedom of trade. None of this do they deserve and a man in the audience, a heckler, got up and said , "But Mr. Gobutinski, denying equality means a denial of our own history." And the Betar wanted to get this heckler, to kick him out, and he said, "No, I'll tell you. I'll tell you and, a story." "There was once in Paris, in France, a very well-known patriot, a Marquis who was very patriotic every ti me the Marciess (ph) was played, or sung, he got up, whatever the conditions and saluted (ph) and one night burglars broke into his house and he reached for his pistol under his pi llow and while he, but when as soon as they started, one of them jumped to the spinet and started to play the Ma rciess (ph) and this Marquis was standing in his nightgown in his bed, saluting, while burglars robb ed him of everything he had. What was this man? He said, "Marciess (ph) or the storyteller. ﬂ "The Marciess is whole (ph) but this man was an idiot!" It doesn't have a lot to do with holocaust, but it tells you a little bit about what type of personality Gobutinski was and, of cour se,_____________. Q: So you say the primary concer n then was not trying to regain equality but getting Jews out of Europe? A: Yes. Yes. Q: Specifically to Palestine? A: I read this memorandum, I told him I wo uld give him a memorandum and I made out a memorandum which I had to translate into Englis h because the German is so poor I had a carbon copy of it, but the carbon copy is not so good. I think I gave a car bon copy before to the museum, I don't know. But it is very poor, it is hardly legibl e, and I am now about to translate it, it is three pages long and so at the beginning of the second page it is dear to us and making the Germans understand that this is not really doing something very illegal ____ . Of course, it was illegal, but this memorandum by ____ abou t, I didn't hear from him, about 10 days later, which I don't know whether it was 10 days, my feeling today is I was sitting in, I was sitting in the outside in the anteroom to the president of the ______________ of the Jewish community and Eichmann was one of his bodyguards which came in and Martin (ph) complained that he saw me sitting there and he 15 pointed me and said, "Oh Cesar (ph) assume Oh Cesar (ph) ___________________________", which is actually nothing will be with it, because we do not wa nt to censor a place for criminality in Palestine.

A: No, I knew that I have to overcome him, but only three more minutes to Berlin I changed my plan. I will not complain about him, but will try to make it appear th at I am upset by him. If they find out, they find out, but the chance that I survive if the plan survived is better than if I say and complain about him. Q: So... A: And I went to see Dr. Karesk i (ph). Kareski was a lawyer in Berlin who was a Revisionist and he told me, "You are crazy to co mplain, the second plans are (ph) . He said, "What do you need from here?" I think I need permission from the Gestapo to go ahead with th e emigration.

Well, ___ _________ of the Gestapo to organize the next transport and the German lawyer was very practical and said, "You need foreign currency, too?" I said, "Of course, I do.ﬂ He said, "If you put anyw here, put it all in one ____________ foreign currency.ﬂ So I went the next day in Berlin where the conditions are still much better than in Vienna because in Germany the percentage of Jews in Germany was much smaller than in Vienna. Vienna was 10 percent Jews in very leading positions. A large percentage of the lawyers, of the doc tors, of the physicians were Jews. S o, much less anti-se mitism and much Nazism going on in Berlin than in Vienna a few days after th e Aunschluss, but all Germany was 16 happy Vienna return of Austri a to Germany ____________ has ne ver been part of Germany.

It was very important and he listened to me very attentively and said, "It is very intere sting, but I have nothing to do with it. See Mr. Soand-So." So I went to Mr. So-and-So and told him, "Mr. So-and-So, there was already somebody. They sent me to you. We are sent from Vienna and __ __________ we are sent by the authorities in Vienna, not by the Betar (ph)." And he listened and said, "I have nothing to do with it." But, I said, "Who has to do with it, with the foreign currency?" Oh, he sent me to the right man and I repeated it for a third time the stor y and he was impressed. Everyone wanted to get rid of the Jews since I made it clear the situation had changed completely with ______________ of Austria and there is I say a memorandum too.

And from this moment on, he played along very nicely. Q: So he wasn't angry at you, that you sort of went around his back. A: He did not know. He did not know. I don't think he knew how I worked it. He just knew that the police had raided our office and that we had the permission from Berlin with currency even from Berlin. He didn't, the German pr overb, "If you have a bo ot on your head you don't go into the sun; if you boot (ph) on your head, you don't go into the sun.ﬂ He had been overruled. And he didn't want to see our trouble, I belie ve, so he went along with it. Q: So at this po int in the late, afte r the Auns chluss... A: That was in May of 1938.

They sa id, "____________ go into this hall," this SS man said. I said, "But," he said "No but." And kicks me and ___ ________ to a ____________ things in line to be shipped out.

I was in Budapest and according to an arrangement with the police, I could take Jews out of the ja il, with the people who ha d come over the border from Czechoslovakia or Poland w ithout papers and were in Hungar ian jails and, and I had, it was a condition for their cooperating with us, take a certain number of Jews from Hungarian jails and from Hungary along and they, they brought me to, I says, "I want to interview them."

So I was taken to see the wife in the same prison in another room and she was spitting blood and she had apparently 25 quite advanced tuberculosis, or anyhow she was not a candidate a nd I had to tell him that they cannot go along. This still oppresses me because no doubt they ended up in Auschwitz. But you had, had to make the decision whom we take alo ng all the time. First of all we took along young people, who were able to withstand any problems of the trip which was ve ry problematic how we do it. Each boat was different. And then people who were Jewish, Jewish commitment was the first thing, if possible, they had the pr iority Jewish commitment and yo ung.

Q: And after this, you went to London, at... A: ____________ on the ninth, they took a transport there and ________ ___ talk to the, to them, to the ____________, they were flabbergasted, the Nazis. As I came to the, to the railroad stations, there was Lange(ph), Lange(ph) and Eichmann(ph) and Tryacowich(ph) standing, so I didn't know how to greet him, what should I tell them? And Tryacowich(ph) came to me and reached my hand 26 and said, "Good evening, Herr ___________." And it was quite __________ _ and I decided then and afterward that I will leave after the war, if he's in trouble, I'll help him. But I didn't, I couldn't because he was accused in Austria and convicted of war crimes against Aust rian refugees but he was also in Holland ___ ________ responsible for the deportatio n of Anne Frank, who, my real desire, but without him the whole thing wouldn't have worked. There were many happy circumstances and I was one of those who was responsible for th e whole thing. But I couldn't testify for him.

Q: Will you just state the na me of the book that you're taking this information from? A: Yeah, ____________ photograph __________ _ The Forefront War, I think there are photographs here. Q: The Forefront War. A: Here they are. No, there are not photographs he re. But I'll give you a co py of the statistics. ____________ have some photographs here. Q: So this... A: The British ___________, was from the fall of 1939 to the end of the, of the Nazi empire, some 21,000 people immigrated illegally into Palestine. Now, if you think th is is a ____________, which is probably generally correct, then you have to kn ow that, in, in the fall of 1939, we had already ___________ many thousands of people into the country. We started in, in June, on 27 ____________, the ninth of June , 1938. Which was one reason, the second reason were ships changed their names and many people came in on th eir own, so I, I believe that the British knew only of about half of the people, though I asked them, they said 40 ,000 people roughly, who entered Palestine illegally, since we started this... Q: So this is, this is quite a large rescue operation. A: Well, ____________. Q: Okay. Now at this point, we're just going chronol ogically, you, you we nt to London? A: I went to London. Q: When was this? A: I go, how do you get to London? Q: I, my question, how could you get to London?

And when we, when we, we come to the landing operations , then the Ergoon (ph) takes over. Q: Now you're mentioning freque ntly the, the Ergoon( ph) and the cooperation of the Ergoon(ph). 28 A: Yeah. Q: Was, within the Zionist framework, the Ergoon(p h) was, you know, one se gment that of course, there was a lot of oppositio n to the Ergoon(ph), even wi thin the Zionist world. A: Yeah, yeah. Q: Did you, was there opp osition to what you were doing, I'm talking about within the Zionist community? A: Yes, very much opposition. The Jewish establishment was against it because they wanted to get good, on good terms with the British and they figured that they need the British after the war, the war was coming, there was no doubt about that. But after the war, th ey'll need the British for they, whatever they wanted to and to annoy the British they didn't understand what we understood, that it is not a question of favor that you do to somebody, international politics is a question of power. So they, they were against us. _____________ soldiers? No . Well. Jabotinsky asked an official if, from the Jewish establishment, I think I saw it now here, cause I have all the documents. Not all the documents, many documents disapp eared, but I have many documen ts.

The executive cannot in any way encourag e illegal immigration into Palestine and for this reason, ca nnot make any contribution toward s the object which your letter refers. A: It was the offi cial ___________. Q: Right, from the Council for German Jewry. A: Yeah. 29 Q: And this was also pub lished in The Forefront War.

Dr. Pe rl, we know of your involvem ent and your initiation of the __________. Were y ou involved in any other ty pe of anti-Nazi resistan ce, a boycott of German goods, in addition to. . .? Answer: I was very much involved before ___________. I was, ____________ _____________ as the first one for the boycott of German goods. And a revolutionist, since I was a revolutionist, we organized it. And I was in charge of organizing this for Austria, Czecho slovakia and Hungary. And I was twice actually in this. This is only that _____________ was so well organized yet when they came in, that they didn't have me on their list . They asked me about the name, ______________ _____________, the name of somebody who had been orga nizing it in the Baltic. Q: Was there, were there Jews wh o didn't want a boycott? Did you consider yourself alone in trying to organize a boycott? A: No I did not consider myself alone. We had quite a positive re sponse. But there were many who for principal reasons were against the boycott. I'll never forget a meeting in Bratislava (ph), ____________, which is about 40 miles east of Vienna and no w it is Czechoslovakia. When ____________ came to give a speech there, we all ___________ there to listen to it. And he spoke then about the boycott. It must have been so mewhere between 1934 and 1948, it probably was in 1935 or 1936. And he said, "The Germans are against the boycott because they ______ up, this is unfair. We have to be equal. We are prejudice against the Germans. The Germans have the right to equality. Equality in arms, equality in treatment, in the press and so on." And as he said this, an elderly man in the audience, a he ckler, shouted, "Mr. _____________ __, this would be a denial of our whole history if we would stand for inequality." And ___________ wanted to pull this guy out of the lecture hall, and he says, indicated they sh ould leave him, and he said, "Either you resist or you will be sorry."

One of his arguments was that whenever the __________ was played , wherever it was, whatever the circumstances, he stood up and stood at attention and saluted. This was known. One 50 day, burglars broke into this house and he reached for his pistol below his pillow, in order to defend himself, and one of the burglars sit down at th e piano, at the spinet, and started playing the ____________. And this man stood up in his nightgown, wi th his nightcap, at attention and saluted while they were robbing him entirely. What does this say? It says th at the ______________ is holy, ______________ is holy, but this man was an idiot. So there are people, it was a wonderful irony, I cannot forget. And this man was one of the few who we re against us. There were people who for principal reas ons said we cannot be against anybody's equality. And this, with boycotting somebody, and they can't do that. Q: And were there people, either in the Zionist movement, not in the revisionist Zionist movement, who perhaps felt that the approach of trying to boycott and leave Europe was wrong? That you should perhaps stay in Eu rope and try to fight for equal rights in Europe? A: I don't understand the question. Q: Your activities with the ___________, your focus was escape from Europe, leaving Europe? A: Not yet at that point. As I mentioned the year, that was 1935 , about three years before Hitler moved into, also three years after you have taken over in Germany. Q: Okay. Just one la st question about the boycott. Were, is it fair to say th at most of the organizers of the boycott were (a) Zionist and (b) re visionists? Was this a Zionist activity? A: No, this crossed party lines.

To travel from Vienna to Paris, people traveled via Germany. Via Ge rmany and USA, and he organized with the _____ ______ and the railroads. Schedule w ith one trip where you could go via Switzerland, throughout the wester n _______ north. And this was many people, not just Jews, who wanted to boycott Germany. And also they wanted to see Switzerland, went through the detour and traveled through Paris and through L ondon. Because it was, as I said, with an alternative, we were very happy about it. 51 Q: Okay. I would just li ke to ask, we're going to jump ahead to 1940, and in 1940 you came to the United States? A: Yes. Q: If you could just describe how you got to the United States in 1940? A: Yes. I was in jail in Athens, I was in practically all the jails in the Balkans, in Yugoslavia, in Greece and in Romania and in Bulgaria. And then I was in jail in Athens because the minister, the ambassadors of Great Britain had protested agains t Marxism (ph) again, very sharply, the Greek Foreign Office _________ document us through this. Where the British Ambassador reports home that I have intervened, the success, and William Perl is already de ported. And I was arrested and deported. Q: The British Ambassador was protesting your activities because you were trying to bring Judaism to Palestine? A: Yes. That is an answer to your question? Q: Right. A: Or how I got to the United Stat es? Well, after this I was in At hens, then I was released, and was in Athens. And then on the day the war broke out , I got on the Orient Ex press and traveled to Switzerland. This was very unlikely that I could travel so free ly with the Jew passport that ______ have. But I had arranged for to get a British entr ance visa, which was the very high, highly valued. And everybody knew Britain , the USA is in with Britain, so everybody tried to get into Britain. And I had gone in, Bucharest (ph) , where the embassy of course knew of my activities for the British Embassy, through the Embass y to get the visa, which seems im possible. And I said I want to speak to the Ambassador. And the guy asked, "Wha t is it about?" I said, "About my intention which I will speak about only to the Ambassador." So the Am bassador didn't come, but the secretary of his came, and I told him, "I want to go to Britain because I want to organize there. Just need money for the transport as I can do it on a larger scale." Of c ourse I would have been arrested right away in Britain. So they tried to catch me by giving me a visa to Br itain and to writing already on the visa, it was written, fo r recreation. For recreation, that was underlined. So that they don't 52 have to prove anything legally, that I was there for recreation. If I wasn't there for this, like these other things, that they could arre st me. With this British visa, but with the othe r ___________, I was transit visas all over. I could travel from there to, from actually __________, from Greece via Italy, via Yugoslavia, and Italy to Switzerland. And in Switzerland, I organized, continued to organize. The war was on and I co ntinued organizing and I organized there. Then the largest transport ever of any gro up, it was __________. At least 2,30 0 and some people. I organized this from Switzerland, together with Dr. Ruben Heitz (ph), whom you probably know by name. And in Italy I was arrested again. I we nt back to Greece and was again arrested in Greece because things had been figured out for me, and was deported to the airport and from the airport I flew to Portugal. And in Portugal I went from th ere, from Portugal, to conti nue the illegal transports. _____________ illegal transports equal to ____________ via the Med iterranean from Portugal. But I couldn't because then I was ____ _____, for the first or second ti me, into the Port of Lisbon in order to negotiate ___________ whic h ship owners would be agreeable to going to this business. There were no Greeks there. A man came to me and while I was in the docks looking for a pair of sunglasses, I turned and he was standing next to me and said, "Dr. Perl, if you show yourself just once more in the Port here, we will have you ar rested and deported back to Germany." Now this was the end. Then I was in Lisbon, they couldn't ge t a visa anymore. Then there was a rumor that you can get visas to Shanghai and I went and got the visa to Shan ghai, to China. Of course, knowing that the visa ex ists means nothing because you had to go to a ___________ at that time and I was, I took a boat, a ship, which was to go from Lisbon to Lorenzo-Marches (ph) which was in Mozambique, for the east colony on the south-east coast of Africa, and from there I was suppose to get a visa to, try to get a visa to the United States, which was very hard. But what is interesting, for the whole story of the Holocaus t is, that it was imposs ible to get an American visa anywhere. This boat landed the first time on the island of San Tome' (ph) . This was a freighter, _________, San Tome' (ph), the name was Mundin-o (ph). And there I went to ask for an American visa and this man had in San Tome' (ph), he had figures, numbers for entr ance into America. Who, what Jew, ___________, a little island of San Tome' (ph) asked for ever ything possible ________ to keep 53 the Jews out. And I sail ed to Portugal, to shorten the story, in Portugal there was a very friendly American consulate who sold me American, I should go to Americ a. Er, to Mozambique. Who sold me America, I should go to Am erica. I could not go to Israel . I wanted to go. Back on the boat was an older man, an industrialists from Israel, from Pales tine there. And he told me keep out from the _______ time is not good because you have to get, if you want to get from Africa to Palestine you have to row by a _________ and the British will get you there. If they will get you, they will get you in Palestine and there you will be busy and ________, important, time and effort trying to get you out so you keep out from Palestine. So I decided to go really not to America. This man gave me the visa to America. A: Besides this there was a pr ice on his head. In Israel. Q: By the British? A: Yes. I know but I have never be able to establish it by document. I was told by the British, I was told by everybody that there's a price of 1,000 pounds on my head, but I have not established this by document. They were serious, they wanted to catch me. Q: Is this how you came to America? A: No, you are in Mozambique now. A: In Mozambique. I had an interesting story for the Holocaust situation, how the St ate Department there. I went to the consulate there, to the Ameri can consulate, and he says, "Yes, it's a very good idea the young man come to America." I said, "Here's my passport that I have for a visa." He says, "It's late now, come tomorrow morning." So I le ft. The next morning, he had spoken with his secretary who was much better informed than he , and she told me you cannot get to America without an affidavit. So I wa s full of ___________, what do you need for an affidavit? She says, "Certified by an American citiz en who is reliable." ____ ______________ ________________ ___________ you shouldn't become a burden to their system." So he said, "Do you have somebody?" I said, "No. But you ca n do it. Why don't you do it?" And he sa id he was ready to do it but then something came up and I needed a quota number, and that's what I wanted to tell you. He didn't have, of course in Mozambique, a quota number but there we re quota numbers in 54 Johannesburg. Nothing in Johannes burg. What's the capital of Sout h Africa? What was it? It doesn't come to my mind. Q: Johannesburg. A: Johannesburg was the capital. Yes. Capetown was the biggest city and Johannesb urg was the capital. They had quota numbers fo r Czech Jews, for Czech's to Americ a. So that's how they, see, quota numbers existed where _________ _____. So I couldn't, he couldn' t give this to me so I said, "From the visa I have in my passport a visa fo r permanent residence in Venezuela", which I have acquired, this was not worri ed, I knew that I had some connections in Athens. And on the strength of this I got his visa. The trans it visa to America. But now that I ________ _ he said ____________ ship coming. Now that I had this, in two or thr ee days, I had some foreig n ship that travels to America and he said, "You can trav el with them." I said, "No, I wait for an American ship." Because Roosevelt, at that time, when you were in ____ ______, flying Dutchman's they are called, the refugees on the ships, they got you on the ship legally, and at no account did they want to take them. They stayed for months an d for years on the boats. So I wa nted to wait for an American ship. I waited for another week and an American ship from the _________ in Baltimore came in, a freighter with the name of Mary. And I went to buy a ticket there and th e Captain told me, "I'm sorry. I can't take you. I know of this flying Dutchman, I can't take yo u." So I told him, "Listen, if you find somebody, if you're out on the high seas and you find somebody dr owning, do you ask for his entrance visa or do you save him? " He said, "I save him, that's my duty, the duty of the seas." I said, "Well I am in great danger because the Portuguese will deport me to Germany unless I leave here. I have to get on a transit." _________ Portugal, so even if th is will go to China, they will deport me. So I never wanted to. So the Portuguese will deport me to Germany. And so he said, "Okay, let me think it over." He was a very nice guy. And I went right away to the Portuguese police and told them you have to give me a certificate that you will deport me because, even if I have to stay here. They give me a confirmation th at unless I leave this island in the permitted time of one month they will _______________ I will be deported. With this I came to Captain 55 Broaderick (ph) and showed it to him. So he said, I'm a drowning man, he has to take me. So I arrived and in Baltimore with the ______ ___ on a freighter, it was a freighter. Q: In 1940? A: In September, 1940. Q: Now I want to go to what the focus of the conve rsation will be, and that's really your return to Europe. You go back to Europe as an Amer ican soldier in 1944? A: Yes. 1944. Yes.

A: Not to the full extent, no. I knew that they are being deported to the east and I assumed they let them starve there and died there because this was not, this couldn't be for a resettlement. They took the people out, dying people and sick people and pe ople who could hardly stand up. The old, and they put them on those trains, and for resettling in the east. But the mass murders I did not know. Q: And when you, when in June, when in 19 44 did you go back? A: To America? Q: To Europe. In 1944, I'm sorry, back to Europe? A: In 1944.

And so here, in both concentration camps, so P uno (ph) was the keyword to us for concentration camp. And she said, all Gestapo. She will visit us from Puno (ph), or something like that. So I knew that she, that she was not a rrested, she was only brought to the Gestapo, she talked there three hours, but she continued. And then when they arrested her and brought her to the Rounds-berg (ph) concentration camp. But I knew at the time in which we are talking about now, or at the end of the war, I knew that she was in, must have been in a concentration camp.

This was important that I rememb er but ________ ___________, his name was Frank (ph), he had a mother who lived in Vienna, and I make a passpor t out for the three of us to get into Russian occupied territory. Which was very strictly forbidden at that ti me because negotiations with the Americans and the Russians went up where we would be and they are not, and the Russians were very suspicious anyhow. And a journalist who admitted to, had ____________ his _________ to Berlin was supported from the entir e theatre of all operations, sent back to Germany, so there was quite some trouble. But I said I am going to Vienna, I'll find ___ _______. And I made the passport in Russian, out to me, with ju st the undersigned, not the unders igned, the officer William Perl, Serial Number so-and-so, will pr oceed in US Military Favor, and the number of the jeep, which I never filled out, and the bor der date, I had to fill it out.

And after you were reunited with Mrs. Perl, what, did you stay in Vienna? [end of side one, tape 4] A: . . . in an hour I got her into the . . . Q: There is something you ought to know. A: It was fantastic. It was lik e in a movie which I never saw, we foresee that, and imagine, it was dark already. And in the light of the jeep you saw these Russians, not the, the Russian horses, small horses, these wagons coming back. They went back with little wagons and pulled us into Russia. They had taken this, and with them came the Russian Flea Ci rcus, who had been brought by the Germans to Russia to work there. And this Flea Circus had robbed the Germans of everything they could. I didn't mind that. There was the women, they are sitting next to the driver of the horses, and there are dressed in fantastic ways. They had stolen or robbed the Germans, the drapes, and sewed these gowns and they were wrapped into this, green and red and blue, shiny. It was unbelievable. And then it was again after we passed, it was pitch dark and we ran into a hole, there was a bump hole, and we came to a river where you couldn't cross, and so on. And this trip was unbelievable. Of course, for her it was the fi rst _______________. Where I said ________ __________. Sure now we got into American territory because she had no paper.

He was horrified. It was a time where every contact with any lower citizen who was not American, with any lower citizen was strictly forbidden. It was very taboo. Which was idiotic because you couldn't speak to your parents who might still be alive. But he was horrified about it 60 and he was scion of the Philadelph ia, a very rich, very well known family. Th is was about all he was. And he called the headquarters of intelli gence, I assume, and said what had happened. Because earlier we were afraid of political complications with the Russians. And so he says, "You proceed now to Batch-schwiber (ph), this is of course the military intelligence headquarters for Germany, and report there to so-and-so. And I took Laura (ph) into the jeep and instead of going to ____________, she was quite sick, she was, looked like a skeleton . And brought her to a hospital in ___________, Lisbon. Whic h disappointed her, and continued to Batch-schwiber (ph) and there I was seen by the General, who said, "What is this, it is horrible what you did, Perl." I said, "Yes I know. But you have to kno w the story." I told him the story and then he says, "What should I do with you?" I says, "Sir, wait a moment. Sir, what would you have d one in my place?" So he think for a second and he says, "Hell I would have done th e same." And he said, "I s it all right with you if I transfer you to another unit and out of milita ry intelligence because this is too much for intelligence. To another unit and take you off th e promotion list?" There was a listing where I was to be promoted to First Lieutenant from Second Lieutenant. I said, "Fine." I was promoted three weeks later. So I was then offered this, and I was then transferred to war crimes. You see, most people ridicule the army because they will send people in the wr ong spot. I was always in the military in the right spot. I was in intelligence when it was really important to be in intelligence. And when the war was over I was transferred to the war crimes, and I was from then on in war crimes until my discharge from the army in December, 1946. Q: Okay. I want to ask you in a minute about the war crimes, but just one other thing. You found Mrs. Perl, of course. Were you in any way trying to look for re latives, friends, Jewish friends who you thought might have perished during the Holocaust? Your, people who were a part of your life before you came to America? Did you know where they were? A: I knew this, they were all go ne. The ____________ is to succeed to get out alive, but there were no known Jews to be left in Vienna at that time. Q: What happened to your brother? 61 A: My brother? He went with th e first larger transport to Israel, to Palestine. But most of my relatives went with those ships but some didn't want to take the risk of the ships and they perished. I had about fourteen relatives, including cousins, fi rst cousins. If I go fa rther it would be more. Fourteen people who were murdered by the Germans. Q: Do you know or did you know how they were murdered? Do you know if they were deported to camps? A: I know only of one. __________ ___________ who helped me with the transport. He had established a branch of this in Prague, and one day he was transferred fr om his office into the _____________ camp, which was a somewhat better ty pe of concentration camp, much better than the others. And there he was kept until one of the last ones, where he was organizer, for the German, he was a leader among the Jews, a German agent. And he was on his way back, they didn't send him to Auschwitz, he went on a trip, on a train to Auschwitz, but on his papers was written "RO", _____________ ____________, Return Undesirable. And he was taken out of the first step, the _________, the fo rtress of ____________ _ of _____________, was taken out and killed there. This is the only one about whom I know. And one cousin I do not know where she knows this from, but I had a cousin who survived in Vienna because she was married to a Jew, but he was racially only half a Je w, so she somehow, she ________ _____, and from her I know that her mother was brought, perished in Lublin (ph), she said. Q: Okay. Now, I'd like to go back to . . . A: Who is still alive in Vienna, who was, she was the daughter of this ma n who was killed in ____________ and she was brought to Auschwitz and she survived Auschwitz. She was strong and was working in a factory after the war. Her hu sband was killed, her father was killed and her mother was killed in Auschwitz. She blames herself very severely for the death of her parents because of her mother. Because, only the father was to be deported. The deportation orders was for the father. Probably they would ha ve run the mother the next time. And she said, "When my father goes I go with him voluntarily. I w on't let him go alone." And the fa ther tried to talk her out of it and she insisted she goes together . So the mother said, "When yo u go and he goes, then I will 62 voluntarily too." Of course they were separate d right away. Her parents were murdered in Auschwitz and she survived Auschw itz. And she then met in Prague another survivor of Auschwitz who's wife and who's child has be en murdered in Auschwitz, and she marries him and she lives in Vienna and she is very well-to-do. Q: This is your cousin? Will you say her name? A: Her name is Susie Lansky (ph). I think if you would interv iew her you will get very good information from her because she is a surviv or of Auschwitz. An d of ______________. Q: Okay. Now getting back to war crimes, you were a tran sfer from intelligen ce to war crimes. Could you talk a little bit about the war crimes, what you did for them? A: I was transferred to war crimes and there was first used in a capa city of which I didn't speak so far. I have studied in Vienna of interest, out of interest, gr aphology, the interpretation of the formality from hand writing. This is based on very sound psychological principal that we express ourselves not only by words but in other ways too, among emotions, emotions. And hand writing is a product of emotions and the ___________ differentiat es changes to scroll copy into his own emotions, that tells us, should be ab le to interpreted as their emotional phase. And it is. You would expect somebody who is ve ry energetic to write in an energetic stroke, an d somebody who is very timid is timi d, maybe ___________ stroke. Somebody who is very depressed, the lines they will go up, ____________ will go up, down and up, and this is all in the simplest, not incorrect description because this is only one thing. You have to know psychology to put these traits all together. You can't build it on one trait. And I used this already in ______ ____ for the interpretation of handwriting of people who ha d to be interrogated, so that the interrogator gets a picture of the personality. I wrote an article about it and I will give you a reprint, but I have only four reprints left. ____________ me in the American Journal of Psychiatry. I have sent it to them. They are the most respected paper in the psychiatric profession, th ey are the official __________ of the American Psychiatric Association and usually you have to wait months or years for the publication of a paper if they accept it. It was accept ed and in two months it was printed. Now I did this first in war crimes, mainly to inform interrogators about the personality of the people whom they wanted to 63 interrogate. But then it became too boring for me. There was more action to be done. So I asked to be sent into the field. And I was sent into the field, which was then, the Germ ans had ________ down many flyers, and the flyers, those who survived, were mostly k illed by the population. They were beaten to death. And I was to go into villages that were there for intelligence and for information, the flyer has landed th ere, nothing was heard of him ag ain, to find out what happened to him and who did what. And I did this, the flyers murders, in several places. In one place, something very odd and funny happe ned. I came there and I knew that the flyer had __________ there and I asked what happened. He was killed. How was he killed? Beaten to death. No, he was shot, he was shot. I said , __________ beaten to death but this fl yer was shot. I said, who did it? So he said, so-and-so did it, he's a Po lish worker. I said, now I want to, I have to talk to him because I assumed that the Germans did it. And they pushed th is Polish worker in front , said he did it. So I had by then __________ there and the crime was admitted at the ___________, I had the name of the Polish worker. And the Polish worker, because it was shortly at the end of the war, was still there. And I said, bring him to me. And he came with a whole bunch of other Polish workers. And I asked him, you killed this young man? He said, I don't know their name but I'm thinking, but I had the right, I was entitled to kill him. I said, what gives you the right? And he showed me a, and he told me that he was very angry at this flyer, at the, wait a moment. No, he said a certain German had killed the flyer and he had killed the Germa n, this worker. The German who was done, who had done it, was known but he was not here. I didn't believe them. They said that the Pollack who shot him is here. So I got this Po le, and he told me, yes I shot him. I said, how did th is happen? He said, he was very bad to the Poles. He beat them and killed them and when the war was over, it was the first __________ village ca me in. I asked a youngster there and he ___________ ____________ leader for permission to kill this guy. And this is what I got, I got the permission to kill him, and he had a little slip of paper, _____________ _ paper with that, okay, kill the guy, so-and-so, Corporal so-and-so. First of all, he was not a Corporal, the p ilot first got the serial number. And with this he had acquired his authorization to shoot him and he shot him. But there were many places where the flyers were killed by the population. 64 Q: What were the nationalities of the flyers? A: They were American. American flyers in the Air Force. And his plane was shot down and he parachuted to what he thought was safety. Q: You were involved in th e Mal-mee-dee (ph) case? A: ____________, yes. Q: If you could just talk about that? A: The war crimes, I _________ ___ ______________, but there was one majo r case on the minds of the Americans. That was the murder of over 70 Amer ican soldiers in the Battle of the Bulge. The Battle of the Bulge was the battle known as the Battle of the Bulge, it is know as, yes. And they shot 70 soldiers and I know how, they vowed that they will follow, hunt these people who did it to the ends of the world. And they were very clever. American intelligence were cooperating, POW and soldiers cooperated to ge t together members of this unit an d started to interrogate them. And they had a very good lawyer, I don't know whether he was a good lawyer, he was a good officer, come and start the interrogation. And he had already enlisted men and the officers separated, but he didn't get anywhere because he to ld them, you don't help I make you aware of your rights, you don™t have to tell, if it would be ag ainst you, and so on. This didn't __________, for the situation, so nobody said anything. So they said, Perl should try. I was only a Second Lieutenant or _____________. So I was put on the case to try to break the iron grip of those people who knew that the unit had done it. But real ly, they didn't know that, the indi viduals had done it. The unit was the toughest of the toughest units in the German military. It was the first SS sponsored regiment of the division, of the Furor's divi sion. And it was the Lindbergh (ph) Nazi Di vision, or something similar. It was the Furor's Division and it was the first sponsored regiment. And this unit, a certain company, this unit had comm itted the crime. So I had to ask somebody into see me, interview him, and to ask him, among other questions, who is pa rticularly foolish and stupid among you? You are mostly very bright guys. He sai d, this guy Fleps (ph) is a very stupid guy. He's Hungarian, and we make fun of his stupidity. Okay. And I had Mr. Fl eps (ph) come in. He was in complete darkness about who had done what and told Fleps (ph), I was sitting there, I said, take his shirt off. They took 65 his shirt off and he had, of course, the SS sign, here under th e __________ and I sa id, here. How do you call this when you have a birth . . . Q: Birth mark? A: A birth mark. I said, yes. So he said I've had this since childhood. You see, he has the birth mark here. This is this ____ _________, you have th e right man now. I said, you started the shooting on this and this place. He said, no I di dn't. Finally he admitted that he had done the shooting but that he had orders to do it. So I ________ __ him, who give him the orders? And then I knew somebody who had give n the orders and I got them all caught up, confessions of everybody, their ________, what they had done. Everyone had shot peopl e before, two or three other places, where they showed us, where they were in a shallow grave, the peop le who got shot. Individuals. This is what I did in war crimes . I was in one or two of the _______ ______ ____ the flyers faces and then I was chief intelligencia of the ______________. Q: Thank you. The, I'd like to co nclude but let me ask you. You, of course, really as a founder of the Ally-a-bet (ph), of course their legal immigr ation continued after the war, between 1945 and 1948. Were you in any way involved? A: No I was not involved in th e resistance any more. It was very ably done by the leftist organizations. Very ably. Q: So Ba-tar (ph) in general, the revisionists was less involved? A: Very little involved, if at all. I do not know about their involvement. In my understanding, he was very little involvement. Q: When did you leave Europe to come to the United States? A: In, after the government of Nuremberg, a week later I left. I wa s not at Nuremberg, at the trial. I was in one of the trials and have photographs of it too. There are films, they ma ke this into a documentary about the _____ ______ Trial. Di d you know that? In Dece mber, about a year or two earlier, of all people told me, yo u are now on the screen, they ar e showing the ____________ Case, a documentary about it. And after I was at the _ _________ Trial, it was by far the most important to the Americans because it involved Americans. 66 Q: And so you, the year that you ca me back to the United States was? A: It was in September, 1946. Q: And did you think at al l of going to Palestine? A: Yes, but she didn't want to go there. She said, I want to, ther e was fighting there, and war, she said, I don't want to, I'm pregnant. I want our ch ild to be born in America. So I went back to America. Q: Okay. You have two sons? A: I have two sons. Rafael, my older one who is a lawyer for the government and Solomon, the younger one who is a veterinarian . You know I was on one very in teresting case which is very connected with the Holocaust. I was not on that case, but I brought myself into it. One day in ____________, I was in ___________, I learned that there was a man, an officer who had been in charge of the Warsaw ghetto, battling in the Warsaw ghetto , was in prison, in jail. Q: Strope (ph)? A: Strope (ph), yes. He was in prison, he was in ___ ______. He had been just captured and there was nothing known about him except that he was no doubt the man re sponsible. He was not in our interest. But he was, war crimes didn't deal wi th him because he was, the crime was committed in foreign territory. In foreign territory or a territo ry which we are not occupying by foreigners. But I went to the prison and said, yes, I want to see this fellow Strope (ph). And I got a folder, it was the very same folder, he said he refu ses to talk under any kind of thr eat. So ___________ did not sense as a threat because this he was prepared for. So I told him, Mr. Strope (p h), he was a tall guy, very slim, graying hair, steel-gray, very bony. I told him, General, or Mr. Str ope (ph), I don't think I called him General, Mr. Strope (ph) , you mind you, y ou look at me, be aware that I'm not really a soldier. I am a scientist and an historian and I am interviewing you about the Warsaw ghetto and if he spoke to me, finally he says, don't speak to me, it's fine too. I couldn't get it. But I think it is in your interest if you talk because so far, because we are informed and we will transfer you tomorrow to the Russians. You occu py Poland and they are know n to be not exactly frie ndly to SS officers. And if you want to make a statement you can do it now. We know what happened in Warsaw from 67 the stories of the Jews, but you are the one who would tell the story of the Germans. High up. But with you this information will be co mpletely gone. So yo u decide whether you want to tell the story or whether you don't. Here you have sheets of paper. You write. If you want to I will come in the afternoon and pick it up or pick up empty sheets. Good-bye. Well, the firs t confession of Strope (ph) and it is in military style, he reports. I am sure that the Jews are not interested in the details, but I wrote that this and this company did this and this many people who were killed in the first __________, this and according to him only 13, 14 or 18, a very small number of Jews that are killed, of Germans that ar e killed in the battle. But he describes how they went into the houses and they are going underground, there were sewers and the Jews were hiding th ere and they finished them all. Q: Is there anything else that you'd like to add befo re we conclude? General reflections or anything? A: No, I've, it might be interestin g, but it is not interesting for th e Holocaust murders. How these are successful in breaking the resistance of Ge rmans and prisoners of war. When I was in _____________ I was assign ed a man, a Naval Officer, who has refused to give any information. And he was very interested to ask because he ha d been stationed at ____ ___________. _________ was the place where they made military rockets. And he was assigned to me to open up. ______________, yes but he was not a prisoner. A: Now he is in the United States. A: Yeah. So I got him and he was a threat, a fanatical N azi. Tried to make out of this for nothing, his ________ towards us. So I approached him, not with any ma rkings of rank, but with a Red Cross on my arm. As a Red Cross Officer who in quires whether he's all right or whether he is properly treated according to the Geneva Conven tion, whether there are any complaints, does he have enough food and enough working, he _________ _____. And th ere came the second time and third time, asked never any questions of military in terest. And then we discovered what he knew about and he was interested in musi c. We discovered that he is ve ry interested in ___________. So I said I'm very interested in ____ _______ too, let us talk about it ne xt time, I have to see somebody 68 else. And I read up ab out ____________ and the next time I came to him he was amazed how much I knew about ___ __________, about his brother Michael ______ ______ and so on. Those were contacts, you know? Of course, he didn't noti ce that I am Jewish. So I told him, listen, how do you see your future? He said, I don't know but I think that we still win th e war. I said, do you really believe this? He said, yes. I said, I tell you, I take you to the city and you can see for yourself, what was the _____________, what they did to London, because ______________ thought that London was half dest royed. And I spoke already with your commanding officer and he said, take him. He says, it's your business. You take him to the c ity. So I took him to the city, I took first his word of ho nor as an officer, I knew he would ne ver break it, that he wouldn't try to escape. I gave him a paper to have in case he trie s to escape, I didn't take a pistol along. And he went, ____________, I said, you tell the driver where you want to go . So he told the driver that he just wanted to go to Piccalilli Circus and ____________, well known places where there was hardly any destruction. I said, here, listen, there's hardly any destruction here. You stop and ask one of the passers-by where is the destruction and there I will bring you. And then you co mpare this to what's happened in Germany. So then he stopped and he asked not the first, only the second person who came by. Where is the best destru ction? He said, I thin k it was some Poles if I'm not mistaken, near some Poles. I said, have the driver drive to some Poles and there we saw so me destruction, a total of about five blocks, a few entirely destroyed. But no comparison to what they did in this. And he _________ back and on the way back there was, between Lon don and, what was the name, where we were stationed? __________ __? ______________? I forgot now, but I was stationed outside London. I mean it was a very secret _____________. End of Tape 4. 69 Tape 5 A: And on the way back I stopped, we stopped at the little grocery stor e there. Before I bought, not Kosher salami but Hebrew Nati onal salami, it was not Kosher but the Kosher-type. And somebody had saw this, oh it was a _______ __ ___________ program and the Americans ha ve plenty of it and they sent plenty of it to Britain and the Britains di dn't like it because it smells of garlic and the garlic in it, so it was not rationed. So I said, on the way back we are going to pass by there, stop me, I want to buy some snack. And we stopped ther e. We went in and I sai d, I want this salami. And this I got and he said, no ___________ ? I said, no. He said, you know they tell us that everything is rationed and almost everything was rationed. Th is thing is _________ too. So now he was ___________ and the next ti me when I came to visit him, I don' t know whether it was the next time but I took time with this thing. I said, do you think now that you lost the war? He said, yes. Because you are in full strength and you are limping. The Air Fo rces don't exist anymore, the German, the Navy is practically not in existence. It was what you have in fighting. You have lost the war. So the first step, my firs t step was to convince him that he had lost th e war. Now came the second step. To convince him that if they lost th e war, the war is lost, the faster the war ends the better it is for Germany. Because every one of them yo u knew in quotation marks, "____________________" and for this you will need the Germans. So I ___________ on this, I said, I do not know but there is the possibility that _____________ develops with the Soviets and that we need the Germans, and anyhow we want to rebuild Germany, a Na zi-free Germany. And you might have some chance to get in to the ministry of naval affair s if you work with me for the reconstruction of Germany. I couldn't do this. I sai d, oh, if you can't do this, but I think it would be your patriotic duty to do it. So the next time I cam e out, the second time, he said, I am __________. I have to work with you for the reconstruction of Germany. Th at was the end. Because I was not a technician, I didn't know what abou t. He was then handed over to the people who asked them the questions they wanted to. And he was talking because he thought he would become a big shot in a new anti-Nazi German ______ ____ of naval affairs. Q: Okay.
