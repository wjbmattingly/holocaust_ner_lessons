BEATRICE LAZAR November 16, 1990 My name before my marriage was Beatrice Le ibovich, becoming after marriage Lazar. I am from Romania, the town of Galati, born on 30th of October, 1927. My father was an accountant. My mother was home, housewife. I had a brother older than me with seven years. When I was six years old my brother told me that Hitler came in power and we'll suffer because we are Jews. In 1940 my parents...my father worked. My mother was a housewife and I started the elementary school when I was a kid. I didn't suffer but later in the high school, I started to feel that I'm Jewish because we were expelled from school. We were not allowed to learn in Romanian schools, and I had to stay one year at home until a Jewish high school was created where all the Jewish kids from Galati went to study. And also in 1940, when the Russians occupied Bessarabia (ph), a strong tendency existed between the ____ to leave for Soviet Union because it was said that anti-Semitism was not so strong there and they could be able to find to work, which wasn't true. When my fath...brothe r was in school, he was beaten up twice and because he suffered so much he decided to leave a nd he lived in Bessarabia. My father...it wasn't easy for him but he agreed with this because he thought that he'll save him this way. Being the younger, I remained with my parents. After that because my father was over fifty years old, he wasn't taken to forced...he was exempt from forced labor but he was forced to clean up the snow for five days and then he was taken with all the Jewish men from the town as hostage. He was interned in a school where he was living on the floor then. We were allowed to bring him a bed and food. They didn't receive there not ever a glass with water. As hostages they were forced to work but their food was in charge of the family, of their families. I remember that one day these people came in the Jewish houses and they confiscated our radios and they and they said that we are spreading rumors and that we are not allowed to own any more radios. My father remained there interned and after two months he was set fr ee and allowed to go home, but he wasn't able to find to work and it was very difficult to live. He tried to work. I finished school and in 1944 2 after the armistice came, we started to receive news from my brother. It was like an iron curtain. We didn't know what happened to him, but after a bit we started to have news and we learned about him. He got married. He had two kids, and in 1946 he wrote that if he could get some papers he would be able to come back to Romania because many Jews who came from Romania succeeded to come back. My father worked hard to to get these papers and he had to go twice to Bucharest. During his second trip, he fall from the tramway and he died, and this way we were not able to get the papers for my brother and he remained in Soviet Union until 1973 when he left for Israel with his family and after a few ye ars he died. I finished the school at the Jewish high school. After 1944, we were allowed to go back to the Romanian school, schools, but not too many went because we felt that we were e xpelled and we didn't want to go back, so we remained in this Jewish school. In 1944 we lived in Galati through hard days because the Russians came as allies, as friends, and the Germans who were very...in big number, retreated. They had to flew and they they burned the town. We stayed almost one week hidden because they were burning everywhere. The whole town was in flames. We escaped and we were able to return to our homes. I finished the school after that in 194...I went I went back to school after I stayed one year at home. But I went to to Je wish school. And I continued this Jewish school until 1947. It was under the Communists. And in 1947 when I finished, I came to Bucharest. PAUSE Life for me was very difficult, very hard becau se of the sufferences of my parents. I was still a kid. I wasn't able to do something on my own and my father and my father being interned in these camps working and being over fifty years old, it was difficult for him to sustain for himself and we had a difficult family life. I went to school and that was it. But I felt all these consequences of the Nazis because my father su ffered being a Jew so this reflected on my my life, on our life, and we didn't...we weren't able to do too much. After that he died, so I...after that I I went to Bucharest, but I wanted to...and in Bucharest I wanted to continue my studies but 3 I wasn't able so I renounced a nd I took a job and I worked. I married. My daughter was born. She studied at her turn and that my my job it wasn't easy because I had relatives outside the country. Immediately after afte r one of my relatives was livi ng with...we were asked to come and to give a report if we are maintaining relations with them. Then my daughter left and we retired. We decided to leave. We renounced our pensions, to our apartment, so one of the reasons for which we were allowed to leave quickly was because we left an apartment and two pensions and this way on which we were able to leave.
