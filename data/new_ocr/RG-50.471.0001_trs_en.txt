Uh, in addition to that of course there was the scarcity of food. Uh, immediately there was--whatever we had in the house we ate. There was almost impossible for us to go out and to buy food.

The one who had lost his family and the reason is because he went to investigate, to see what happened to his family and they caught him on the way and they arrested him and of course what we found out later is that there were--all of them had been killed, uh on that Fort.

DL: Yes, it--it was a rather a uh--a simple--uh way uh we were told that by the 15th of August, 1941, we had to evacuate our homes and apartments and that we had to moved to a predesignated area in--in a--in across the river. That same area where my uncle's family had died earlier. Uh and it was called Slabatka and it was called a Slabatka ghetto and uh they had formed actual- ly 2 ghettos because there was a main street or road that ran through the uh city, so they had made one large ghetto, one small ghetto with a bridge that crossed from one to the other. And--and we had to uh ourselves find uh a place where to live. Of course there were a number of uh people--Lithuanians, who lived in this area--they had to move out. In some cases we traded apartments. Some or traded places. They would take the place or course we could take nothing with us except what we could carry like I said before transportation was forbidden. So, whatever uh we could find in--in--in the empty apartments or what- ever what we could carry with us is what we sustained us for the rest of--of the time. Fortunately, we found a place at the very end of the ghetto; in the very farthest part. And we found a 2 bedroom apartment that was empty and um we moved in there of course the almost the entire family that was left was moved in there. There were as many as I believe 14 people.

The only thing is since a little a little innovation is that to carry some of the stuff that my mother needed uh for the new place cause we made several trips back and forth. Uh, we uh took a table and turned it upside down and made sort of a sled out of it and we put some cardboard around the legs and tied it with strings and put some stuff in there and then pulled it all the way across perhaps as much as uh um 7 or 8 kilometers and that was an ordeal but we--we--we managed to take some things that we needed over and we moved into the new apartment and that--in the ghetto--and that was, in a way, to get it started cuz everyone will have a different story to tell and how they got in and what happened cuz those uh Jews who already lived there didn't have to do anything. The stayed in their own homes that they had lived in for many years. Um, and uh, just life continued for a little while cuz the ghetto was uh surrounded with barbed wire fences all the way around. There were gates to come in and out. And uh, immediately after that uh--uh the um the community--the Jewish community started to form some--some bits of organization with a police force--a ghetto police uh and--and--and uh committees and--and--and uh what we called the uh--the uh--I suppose you might call the mayor of the ghetto.

Because the Germans started building an airport that could handle uh--uh military planes cuz that airport was very small before then and building runways and that is what many--many hundreds of--of Jews were doing during the first uh several months of the ghetto. Uh, until uh some things started happening very quickly and of course the first thing that happened was the--the elimination of the small ghetto that I had mentioned before. Um, there were perhaps as many as 2 or 3 thousand people that lived in the small ghetto and all of them were taken to the 9th Fort at one time. I believe that was the beginning of October; either the 4th or the 6th of October. And--and--and--and they were taken there and--and--and at one point, they were brought back because I don't know why. They were taken there and brought back and--and they were telling us that they had seen um they had seen graves--pre-dug graves of what they thought were graves and but they had brought them back, so we weren't very concerned about that. But uh several days later, they took them out and didn't bring them back. And uh and this small whatever--whoever was left in the small ghetto was forced into the large ghetto and uh the small ghetto stayed empty for a while. until the 28th of October and uh that is when the first what we called Indidist Case Action or the large selection and that is when half the people of the ghetto were separated from the other half and taken to the 9th fort.

And we were told that all of us had to leave our homes and uh gather in a place called uh--uh the Democratu place and no one may stay in the house and--and all the doors must be left open because they were going to uh--going to search for contraband or hidden perhaps weapons, per- haps communication radios, gold, silver, furs, whatever they could find. We were not allowed to take anything with us except clothing that we were wearing and uh that is what we thought was going to happen. And well they took us out to that place and we stood there for perhaps--we gathered there 6 o'clock in the morning and we stood there for perhaps 3 or 4 hours waiting for the 3rd shift to comeback from the airport who worked at the airport. Uh and--and of course since those had worked at the airport the most, many were just men, as they when they came into this uh place where we were gathered, they started looking for there families; their wives and their children. And uh w--in many cases it uh--they couldn't find one another. Then the uh, Germans arrived, uh the S.S. And they set up sort of like a platform and they told us that we had to march by them in a single file by family. Every family by itself.

Uh, those who were went to the left to the good side so to speak went all the way around and came back to where they came from to the Democratu plots. The others were taken over in the other side. So as those who had not yet gone through the selection, there was a piece of room between the those who had already gone through, those who had not. And occasionally some would realize this was the good side and they would sneak over, even though there were Lithuanian guards guarding all the way across. The line--the marking--those who had not yet been gone through the--the uh selection and those already who had gone through to the good side. That went on until very late that night uh and when it was over, those who had gone over to the right side, the bad side, uh were taken to that small ghetto that I described earlier and there they were held. Us, we could go back to our homes an when we came back to our homes we weren't quite sure what to make of it and uh the--the wish was that they would be living in the small ghetto and ours would become, because we are um, uh people healthier and the older the children we--we would become the workforce and they would become someone that had to be helped.

Um but uh as the morning progressed we lived very near to the hill and we could hear the machine guns um starting to work in--in--in bursts. And--and we knew what was happening. Every time the machine guns would start shooting, I could feel my stomach turning inside out. I could feel the pain and--and that I will never forget. That was uh something that has stayed with me forever. There are many things that happened during the 4 years of uh ghettos and concen- tration camps that I've forgotten or I don't think about but this day is--is--is one of the 2 days that stays with me forever because I witnessed all that. My mother who was sitting and still not speaking suddenly got up the next day because it took more than one day to kill 10,000 people, uh she uh got up and said, 'Oh, I hear the machine guns.' She said, 'But I know they are shooting over their heads because they are just trying to make us believe that they are killing them but they are just scaring us. The want us to stay in line so they are shooting over their head making us think that they are killing those people.' Of course let her believe that.

She wouldn't let anyone touch it because she says when her sister comes back, she's going to want that. That was the end of the innocent time in the ghetto.

The underground was working and--and--and the that we heard about uh they were taking up arms against the Germans and the force and in the highways and the Germans were shooting back and taking it--taking revenge of some of the Jews in the ghetto because they had a standing order that is anyone kills a German, 100 Jews would die.

He knew exactly what--what was happening uh he--he--he--he--he had a feeling and I put the suitcase back under the bed and I jumped on top of the bed a couple of times to--to cause the dust to settle on it, so it would look like the suitcase had not been opened recently and I went back to the window to see what happened. Uh--uh--the uh--within a minute there was a Ukrainian soldiers came through the door of the apart- ment and uh he asked were there any children here and I said no there aren't any and he said I going to look and if I find any, he said, 'Not only will I take the child, but you will come.' Of course, in the begin- ning, he examined my papers to see I was only 14. I was strong enough to be able to work but he looked at my papers and so that since I worked, he let me alone but he said that, if he finds a child, I will go with Video Tape No.____ Camera Roll No. ____ Sound Roll No. ____ KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/DAVID LEVINE page 23 Interviewed (5-1-97) by Sandra W.

Of course, he didn't find the little boy didn't say anything. Uh, he was distracted because suddenly he heard a baby cry. And he walked out into the hall and there was uh--uh somebody had uh stuffed a baby into a linen closet in the hall and--and I never knew whose baby that was--I had never seen that baby before. The baby was perhaps a year and a half old--a little girl. And he grabbed that child and walked out. So he left me alone. I went back to the window and--and--and as he had taken that lil--child and put it in the bus and--and then of--the child was crying of course once he got on the bus, the voices were muffled. Um, and then I--I--I heard screams and crying and I look back and there was another Ukrainian soldier and he was dragging a woman, a mother and she had two little girls and uh he was uh--he was--she wouldn't let go of the 2 children, she just held on to them and they held on to her and he was beating her with (cough)--with a uh the butt of his riffle and--and--and she was bleeding uh from her mouth and from her nose and blood going down--I could see her face--even today I could still see it and uh but she wouldn't let those 2 little girls go. One must have been about 3 and one about 5 and--and uh when he got close to the bus, he couldn't take them away and--and so the German came over. He was a S.S. Lieutenant uh and he said, 'What this commotion? What's going on?' And--and--and he says she won't let go of the children.

And of course he's asking a mother to select one of her two little girls. She um immediately had quieted her down. She stopped struggling and the two little girls under- stood what he said because they knew exactly what was happening and both started talking to her and say uh 'Mother, take me. Take me.' And uh she--she stopped the struggle and took the two little girls by their hands and walked on the bus with them and of course she died with them uh that day. Uh, when the day was over, um 11 hundred and 83 children were taken and uh killed that day. Uh, those were the last Jewish children in Lithuania, outside of those perhaps a few dozen that were hidden previously and a couple--some that somehow got hidden during this selection like I hid my little nephew. Uh, and that was end of the Lithuanian uh Jewish people. Uh, most had died at the beginning of the war, in the first week. Uh, there were 180,000 Jews, uh perhaps uh a hundred and forty were killed in the beginning and the rest uh little by little were--were killed through selections--massacres and--and--and simply shootings and starvation and, of course, the children that we kept as long as we could uh died then; that day. My nephew cause I--difficult to say this but uh, he--he lived another um for a month or so and--and then he and my mother both died in the gas chambers in the gas chambers in Auschwitz.

She was only 42-years-old when she was killed and uh um and--and--and in part I--all the years I have sort of blamed myself because if I had not save that little boy, my mother would have survived. I had a choice...also. (crying) That was very well...That was very well the end of the ghetto because after that day, (crying)...whatever hope I still had was gone after that day and we were resigned to uh--to our final destination. We never believed that the rest of us would survive. It wasn't long after when the Soviet armies started to uh advance towards Lithuania and they decided to liquidate the ghetto and uh we were taken by--we walked from the ghetto to uh--uh several kilome- ters to a train where we were loaded and taken to a place called Studhoff, where my mother and the child uh was taken off the train and my father and I continued on--on this day. We were never taken off train, we continued on to towards uh Dakow. And later learned that the she and the child were taken to Studhoff, where they lived several weeks and--and uh then those were women who were strong were and by themselves uh were taken to work somewhere in Poland or in East Germany somewhere. Uh, the rest, those with children, were taken to Auschwitz and--and the fact is I um have the date when the died. They died July the 15th of uh 19 uh 44. And my father and I continued on and finally wound up in Dakow, uh near--near Munich, where we spent the rest of the war time.

DL: I don't know a lot about the inner workings of the council. I just know that uh whenever the uh Germans uh needed to select people for uh to send out like to Riga or to uh Estonia or to other areas, they would come to the council and ask them to um--they would ask them to uh provide the names of people. Now, in--nobody knew whether these people would survive--whether they would actually go for to work or whether they would die and there were a burden on the council was to uh--uh to actually themselves uh be the judges of who should live and who should die. And that was a great burden on them. As far as the council, itself is concerned the inner workings and how they as--is--is isn't--isn't something that I know very well.

Bradley Wentworth Films, Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd, Potomac, MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: nobody was really um angry with them because everybody understood that they really don't have much of a choice. Uh the--what I do know for instance, is that before uh the--the what we call the great actia, there was the council that. The question was whether or not we sho--the council should cooperate with the Germans. And--and ask everyone--all the Jews to come out to the Democratu Plots--eh--p--place. And--and but they didn't know there were some who said yes and some who said--said no. We shouldn't have to make that decision so they went to one of the Rabbis who--who uh--who uh thought about it for days because they are--they knew ahead of time--the didn't just--they weren't just told the day before and--and uh he--he--this Rabbi apparent--the way I understand--what I know was for many days, he was studying the time would see whether the council has the right or the moral right to ask the Jews to make the sacrifice or whether to tell nothing--let the Germans decide what they want to do or should they help the Germans. Which would be better for the Jews and finally the Rabbi's decision--they all agreed that the decision would be that of the Rabbi. I can't remember his name right now but perhaps some of the other interviewees will remember. He--he rendered--he rendered the decision and--and--and said that yes they should--they should help the Jews. It would be better for the entire ghetto population if uh if--if there's order.

Bradley Wentworth Films, Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd, Potomac, MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: DL: The Jewish polices was um--um the same as any police force. Some were uh took their jobs too seri- ously and some--but most were pretty decent people who--whose uh--who was thought--who thought that as--as a job--as an easy a--easy work for them, as compared to going out and working on--on the airport that the Germans were building or to got to other working bri- gades. So they took the job, although they knew that this would--would not going--this isn't going to be very uh--uh popular with some people. But in--in--for what I know and the policeman that encountered, I uh, they were pretty decent people, most of them. With exception of a couple who--who took their jobs vacti- tiously and became very--very aggressive and uh and --and--and--and selfish. Especially those who worked at the uh well the had the--the--the gate police who worked at the gate of the ghetto and of course there is that they would, some would ask who ever brought some stuff in, they would ask for--for a--for a--uh piece of the action. So if you brought in uh, uh, 5 pounds or flour you would have to give them a pound or so just for letting you by or--or--or--or getting the German out of the way, so you could go in. So that--that is something that happened in--in every society where you have a little bit of power and authority, you use it. But normally they were decent people.

The driver was separated from the rest of the bus eh with--with--with a partition and--and--and--and--and as the children went into the bus, their noises were muffled because they started breathing in the--the us um--the exhaust gases. Uh, by the time the children were taken to the 9th Fort, where they were buried, most of them were dead and--and those who um were still alive or were not quite dead, were buried alive because during that day, I did not hear any machine gun fire. So they had to be disposed of or killed uh in other--in other ways and--and that is most likely the way they were killed. SB: And did you ever talk to any Lithuanians who maybe worked at the 9th Fort or have any contact with any perpetrators.

At my age was something that uh happened under the circumstances uh I remember this little girl and--and--and one is New York today and uh that uh we hung out together with some of my friends who--who--who--who are alive today. And--and when we get together we reminisce about those times. It's--it's interesting that the only time we talk about what we talked about here today, is when I talk to people like you. Uh, when we talk to one another, it's we always talk about the times that we could laugh--times that we enjoyed, songs that we sang, poems that we composed uh--uh looking at the moon um and--and--and thinking perhaps uh the moon up there looked the same moon is shines over America. While he would it be possible perhaps to uh just jump over, you know these sort of things.
