HELGA GROSS January 22, 2003 Beginning File One Question: This is January 22 nd, and we™re at the home of Helga Gross for an interview for the Holocaust Museum. Would you tell us about where you grew up, what your family was like; your parents, your siblings, your background? Answer: I grew up at my parents™ home. I was a very happy child, until Hitler changed everything, and he changed my life. It was very rough. Q: Did you know about Hitler and his policies? When did you become aware of Hitler and his Œ and his policies? A: He was president of Œ in Germany , Interbruck (ph). Oh, at the Hindenburg . When Hindenburg , when he died, Hitler took over. We were all shocked that that happened. Before, we didn™t know. My grandmother was crying, my mother and father, what™s going on? We had no idea. Q: How old were Œ how old were you at the time? A: I think it was 1933 when he took over, so I was 13 years old. I remember it well, when I saw my parents and my grandmother, they were all crying. I didn™t understand yet, I was still too young, and I was deaf. So, interviews were very difficult. Interview with Helga Gross January 22, 2003 4 Q: How did you communicate in your family, because Œ well, first tell us Œ I Œ I™m sorry, first tell us about your family, and were they all deaf, or were your parents deaf, or Œ tell Œ give us a little bit more about what your family was like. A: My parents were hearing. My father was awkward. He really didn™t have good communication with Œ with deaf people. My mother, my mother was a singer, and she really taught me how to speak, and play the piano, and with intonation, using the piano, and I practiced a lot. And that™s one reason I s Œ I spoke well, the German language, that is. Every morning at breakfast, we would sit with paper and pencil, and I would try and talk to my parents, using a different language, and my parents thought that I was using a wrong language. They said, you must speak properly. If it was wrong, then we would write down on the paper, and Œ on the paper, the correct way. And they told me I must read a lot of books, and learn the language correct ly. Q: So Œ so, it was your mother who really was the communicator in the family? A: Yes. Q: What about with your Œ A: They never ignored Œ my mother never ignored me or my brother. The two of us were deaf, and she always paid attention to us. I have another brother and sister as well, and they™re hearing. And they play music. I couldn™t hear anything, but we Interview with Helga Gross January 22, 2003 5 were very happy as children. Always music in the house. Music™s in our blood, all of us. Q: T-T-Tell Œ go ahead. A: When people would come to visit, or to eat, there were Œ we were always playing, and they would ask us questions. They would say the alphabet. For five minutes we would have to write, or I would write, until I got everything right. And if the names were wrong, I would be like a game, who could remember the names, and who could spell them right. And I would win. I remember being so happy. We would go out after dinner for a walk. My father taught me what™s the name of that tree, and see that bird? Here™s the name of this bird, and always trying to teach me, my father was. All of the children, actually. He would use gestures, and he would move his mouth. Q: How did she understand what he was saying? Did she read lips, or Œ A: Yes, I read his lips. My mother could see in my mind, but the German language, I hadn™t learned it, it was a hard process. [phone ringing] Q: Can you tell her to stop the telephone ringing? [technical , break] Ask her again, because the phone Œ because the phone rang, if she would tell us again about how she and her father communicated. A: Again? Start from what I said before, or what Œ what do you mean again? Interview with Helga Gross January 22, 2003 6 Q: Yes, from what Œ from what Œ from what she said before about when she would walk with her father Œ [phone ringing] We have to unplug the phone. [technical interrupti on, break] Okay, so I-I™m trying to understand if Œ if her family, did they sign, or did they just read lips, or how did they Œ how did they communicate? A: We Œ lips Œ we read lips, and signed, too. My parents didn™t have anything against signing. They thought signing was beautiful. Signing as Œ helped to relax with deaf people. It™s hard to just Œ and stressful to just read lips, so they preferred us to be relaxed. Some other people™s parents were against signing, and they really forced them to speech read, and the children got very frustrated, but I was very relaxed, and very happy, because my mother and father had a lot of music in the house, and they understood the arts, and there was a lot of love around us always. I was very lucky to have my Œ the parents I had. Q: Tell us Œ tell us about your school, what Œ what kind of school you went to. A: It was a deaf school. Did you read about Œ deaf and dumb is what it means. A long time ago, they used to refer to deaf, as deaf and dumb. Deaf stumm , in German. And I would be silent, I would just say deaf, not dumb. Now, it™s like handicapped. That™s much better than a long time ago, when they said deaf and dumb. I would go back and forth, from home to school. It was about a 30 minute walk. I was very happy with my classmates at school. We played around, we talked. Interview with Helga Gross January 22, 2003 7 Signing was not allowed in school, the teachers forced us to speech read. But when we were outside, we all signed together. Q: And how long did you go to this school? Was it Œ did she start school in this school? Was this from Œ A: Until I was 14 years old, I went to that school , maybe I went Œ my mother took me to school, I think first to a hard of hearing school, and they found out that my Œ I didn™t hear well enough. So then they put me in the school for the deaf. I was nine years old, eight or nine, at the time. Stayed there until I was 14. Then I stayed home with my parents. I was like a house-daughter, I cleaned, I cooked. They taught me how to Œ to speak, and how to do a lot of things. Q: Was this Œ A: When I was Œ two year later, when I was 16, this house-daughter learned to cook and sew and everything, so then I went to work. I went to work as a weaver. I learned art, I went to school with hearing people, of course. It was really difficult for me. I was frustrated. I didn™t really understand what the teacher was saying. My mother talked with the administrators about my problem in being deaf. Bibliothèque. I went into the library, got books, and it still didn™t satisfy me enough, I needed to have that one-on-one education. But I had to accept that I was deaf, so they just went ahead and let me go to work. I think when I was 17 or 18 years old, Interview with Helga Gross January 22, 2003 8 the boss where I was doing weaving, he really liked me, I was kind of his pet. He liked my designs. A very small town, where he lived, the boss invited me to their house to work. There was one town, then Hamburg , and another town. The bombs started happening in Hamburg , and destroyed everything. My parents evacuated, they went south. I stayed in the island. I stayed in the island Œ on the island. I begged my boss to contact my parents, but he refused. He just told me to stay put, and I cried so much. I hoped that my parents were still alive. I didn™t know if they were dead or alive, there was no contact for a month. And finally, we received word that my parents were alive. Then my boss allowed me to go and to see my parents. And I stayed in the south, in Bavaria . Q: A-Ask her how Œ how old was she when she Œ when she left school, and then how old was she when she left Œ A: I was 14 when I left school. Q: And when did you leave home? A: Around 16. Our house was destroyed by fire. My father had many, many books in the fire, destroyed all of them but one. My brother and I Œ the three of us, my deaf brother and I Œ the other brother and sister were gone. One was in the army, my other sister was gone, my deaf brother and I, we were with my parents, and we saw what was left. A lot of people died from the bombings and the fires. Interview with Helga Gross January 22, 2003 9 Q: Can we go back? When she was in school, and talked about what happened when the steriliz Œ how they were told by their teacher, when the sterilization law took effect? One moment. [break] So again, my question is when did she fi Œ how did she find out about the sterilization law, and how did they talk to her about it in school? A: In the class, the teacher came into the room and said, good morning. There were six boys and four girls, and I was one of the girls. We were all sitting in like a semicircle. The teacher was standing up by the window. He was looking Œ we were just waiting. The teacher didn™t teach anything. We were wondering what was wrong. Then came a man from the government. It was very interesting, and he said to all of us, school students Œ he was explaining to us how to breathe. And you must go to the hospital for sterilization. And we said what? Why? What do you mean, go to the hospital for sterilization? He explained that when you grow up and get married, you won™t be able to have a baby. We said, huh? It means we can™t have a baby? We all looked at each other. We really didn™t understand. Then he left. I went home, and I told my mother. My mother really didn™t explain it to me. Later I found out that my mother had gotten a letter from them. No, wait, forget, just a moment. They chose an 11 year old girl from my class. She had deaf parents. They took them all to the hospital at one time, and sterilized them. When they came back Œ we were Interview with Helga Gross January 22, 2003 10 young, we really didn™t understand. Especially, clearly, we didn™t understand what it all meant. Well, we just thought nothing of it, and continued playing. My father, I was like his pet, he really loved me. And I felt funny. I told my mother, why is my father so affectionate and loves me so much, as compared with my other sisters and brothers? Why, what™s wrong? Mother said, oh your father likes you just like everybody else. Everybody™s equal. He loves to see you smile, though. He called me sunshine. Then, as the time became near, I remember very well, I was in the kitchen, and I was cleaning. My mother came and said, Helga , sit down. And she explained, you have to go to the hospital in two days. I said, I have to go to the hospital to get sterilized? I was calm. I kind of accepted it. My mother must have thought something was wrong, or that I was going to run away, or get crazy, but I was very calm. She said, how come Œ later she asked me, how come you were so calm? And I said, well, the other girls had it done, so I just accepted it, that it was fair. If they did, I guess it was my turn. My father cried. He refused to see me. He didn™t want to hug me before I left home to go to the hospital. It was a very small, cute hospital, very nice place actually. Babies Œ only babies were born there. A woman did the surgery. Gave me anesthetic and a shot, that everything was good and clean. After the surgery, I woke up, I was throwing up, and I could Œ I could feel something heavy on my stomach. My mother was sitting next to me, and I Interview with Helga Gross January 22, 2003 11 tapped her, she was like sleeping. I said, Mummy, Mummy. The second sister underneath me, opened the door and looked in and said hi. Her big eyes looked in at me, and I was laughing. She was so funny, to see her just these two big eyes, poking through the door. Oh, but the pain when I laughed, oh-ho, great pain. I said go away. Where was my father? He couldn™t come. He was so embra Œ embarrassed, because he was crying for me. Later, two of my schoolmates came, and the three of us just sat and cried. Q: Did she know Œ did she know Œ well, to go back a little bit, when Œ how old was she when that man first came in, and then how old was she when the Œ the operation happened to her? A: I was 11 or 12 years old. The other girl was 11 when she went to the hospital, I hadn™t gone to the hospital I was Œ until I was 16. They were hoping that I wouldn™t have to go, but I wanted to become a grandmother, you see, and that™s the reason Œ or, they wanted to become a grandmother if I Œ I had a child, and that™s the reason my mother was crying, and my father, too. Q: Did she un Œ did you understand why this was happening, why they were doing this? A: Not until later. Years later. When I moved to the United States in 1954, five years later, I went back to Germany for a visit. I saw my baby sister. She had a Interview with Helga Gross January 22, 2003 12 beautiful baby. The baby was so beautiful, I got to hold the baby. And that morning, my sister was feeding the baby, and then I realized what I felt, when I realized I couldn™t have any children. I started to cry, and I Œ I ran into the bathroom, and just cried and cried. When I came back out, my sister said, what™s wrong, what™s the matter? I said, oh, I™m just crying because I™m happy for you because you have a beautiful child. Then the next day I saw other people, and I Œ with babies, and I cried. And as I got older, I tried to forget about it. Q: How old was she when this Œ when this happened, when she took this trip? Was she married, or was she single, or Œ A: I was married then. I was 35 years old, about. Q: Did Œ did Œ did the officials, the government officials, or your family, explain why this had to happen to you? Why this operation was going to happen? A: My mother™s brother was a judge, and he was trying to help us, to prevent the operation. He was not successful. Oh, he was not a member of the Nazi regime, so it didn™t work. My father was the same way. I was a Girl Scout, and they were trying to force me to become a member of the Nazi party. I said oh, no. They said, you must. I said, why? Because you can speak with hearing people, and other Œ and children. Well, my mother taught me how to spe ak. They gave me the paper, told me I had to go to the flag Œ where the flag was, and sign some papers. I refused. My Interview with Helga Gross January 22, 2003 13 weaving boss invited me to the island to stay, and I went there and I told the teacher, I™m leaving for the island, they invited me. I don™t know how long I™ll stay. She said, bring the papers with you. You must go in there with your papers, and take them with you everywhere. My heart sank. I felt so much fear, for a very long time. I would sleep, and then I would walk to work. The Nazis, two of them, would stand there with their flags, as I walked by. I had the papers with me all the time. Should I go or not, should I go or not? I would pass them. I was afraid they™d pull me back by my hair, but they didn™t, I™d say no. And every day this would happen, and I™d be filled with fear as I walked past these two men with their flags. And they were bombing Hamburg . And I needed a rest, and I thought I needed some relief. But I heard later that our teacher was dead from the bombs. Then, when I went t o the south, to join with my father and mother, I still had those papers with me. Then, during the war, then we saw the white flag. Bombs were everywhere. And now I could claim Œ come to Œ from south, I went to Œ could go to America . Before I came to America , in Germany , the Americans Œ the Germans, we lost the war. Hitler died; that was good. When we saw the white flag, it meant that we had given up, that there was no more war. The American soldiers saw us, and they tore the papers, threw them away, threw them in the fireplace, and burned them up. Boy, did I feel relieved. Then years later, I wanted to come to the USA , my husband™s uncle Interview with Helga Gross January 22, 2003 14 helped us, they Œ to support us for five years. And after five years, I became an American citizen. Before, in Germany , in Hamburg , my husband and I asked his aunt and uncle Œ they lived in Michigan , Detroit , Michigan Œ we came as an immi Œ as immigrants, and they were very happy to help us, to support us. But the aunt and uncle went to the American consulate, and at the consulate they asked for papers, and they told them about my husband and I, that we were deaf. They turned us down. They say deaf was not allowed to come to the United States . I was very disappointed. Two years later, one American man from Boston Œ he was dea f himself, we became good friends. We told him about wanting to come to the States, and we said we were looking for freedom. And I had read books about America , and I was so impressed. This man said, good. He helped us go to the American consulate, and asked for our papers, and he said, I will support them. They turned us down again. Second time I was disappointed. End of File One Interview with Helga Gross January 22, 2003 15 Beginning File Two A: So the Œ the gentleman went to Washington , D.C. He typed out everything, and finally they allowed us to come to the United States , thanks to this gentleman from Boston. We had been waiting for two years on a Œ on a list. There were many people. Finally, they called us Œ well, actually, it was less than two years Œ they called us to come to America . The first and second times, there were so many questions, and there was a Œ a list. And one of the questions that they asked, had you been a member of the Nazi party? And I answered, no. And in my mind I looked back, and I thought, if I had said yes, they wouldn™t let us come to the U.S., if I had joined, way back when. This is true. So I™m so happy that that never took place, that they didn™t force me. So they swore us in. You have to obey the laws in the United States , and they explained some of the rules, and we s aid yes, yes, I do, I do. Q: Okay, let™s go back, and again I Œ I need to know how Œ if they explained why this operation needed to hap Œ needed to happen to you deaf children? A: Because my [interruption] Q: The question is Œ A: They explained to the deaf children that they didn™t want deaf children Œ that they had to be sterilized because they didn™t want deaf children to have children Interview with Helga Gross January 22, 2003 16 who would grow up and be deaf as well. So this is how they explained it to us. And my br other was deaf, as well as me. So a long time ago, in the generation, it just happened to the two of us, we don™t know why. So this other classmate of mine, her parents were hearing, and she was free from it, because her father was a member of the Nazi party. Q: Did you think, because there was so much time that passed, from the time that they first told you, til you were 16 and they took you for the operation, did you Œ did you think all that time that you were still possibly going to get this operation? A: Well, really, I wasn™t even thinking about it. My mother didn™t explain it to me enough, and the teacher certainly didn™t explain it to all of us. Once was enough, that was all, once they told us, and not more than that. So I didn™t really give it much thought. Q: Did anyone, either in your family, or in the school, try to stop them from doing these operations? A: The school, people from the school, but not my family. Q: Okay, she has to, again, nobody™s going to know what I asked her. A: The man that came from the government to our school, told the teacher to choose which children that we should send to the hospital for sterilization. Q: Did a Œ but, did anyone try to stop them from doing it? Interview with Helga Gross January 22, 2003 17 A: My uncle, who was a judge, tried to stop it from happening, but he failed. Q: Okay. After Œ no, that™s [indecipherable] I™m sorry. After the war, how did the operation affect your plans to marry? A: My husband Œ I felt sorry for my husband. He Œ he was sterilized too, and he had gotten the letter. And they sent him to the hospital, and he refused, he rebelled against it. Then he got a second letter, and he rebelled again. The third time, they came and took him to the hospital. Without any anesthetic, they just tied his hands down, and they sterilized him. And he screamed. But he was very strong in his mind, very wonderful. He was a good sportsman. He was in the Olympic swimmers Œ he was an Olympic swimmer. After the operation, no, he went downhill. Q: Was this Œ A: So, he was looking for a woman, and then he found me. And I was a good swimmer, too. So we had peace of mind, neither of u Œ neither of us could have children. So, it Œ it was a good marriage, in that sense. Q: How old was her husband when Œ when they did this to him? A: I think it was 17 or 18 years old, I think. Q: He was 17 or 18 years old, what? A: When they sterilized him. His aunt from Michigan had come to see him. My husband must have gone to the hospital for sterilization, and my Œ my Œ his aunt Interview with Helga Gross January 22, 2003 18 said, come with me, come with me. And the Œ he said no. He was in the headlines because he was a famous swimmer, like Johnny Weissmuller was in the States . He kept all of these clippings together, and his aunt did. And his father said to him, you have to play with girls before you have a baby, before you get sterilized. And he said no, I don™t want to play with girls. Q: So Œ A: But it failed. They took him anyway. Q: So even though he was a famous, admired athlete, that didn™t keep them from doing this to him? A: No. I don™t know why, but they didn™t ask him any questions, really. I really don™t like to think of the past so much, and he didn™t think about it. We now have to look forward. I feel sorry for so Œ thousands of people who died. They had it Œ in the camps, they had it worse than I did, actually. I™m thankful. I™m very thankful. I™m still alive. I™m 80 years old. I can climb, I can do lots of things. Q: I have a question. It sounds like your family life was wonderful. A: Yes. Q: So, to your parents, there was nothing wrong with you, but you couldn™t hear Œ except you couldn™t hear. And then the government comes Œ and then the government comes, and says you™re defective. Interview with Helga Gross January 22, 2003 19 A: Defective? My parents were very proud, and they were proud that I could come to the United States , they applauded that, without an interpreter, just the two of us, ourselves. Because that world was certainly different. And I learned English. In Germany , I learned English there, too. I could say goodbye, I love you, thank you. Just a little bit of English, and then I progressed. Q: But Œ but my question is, when you were a child there, in Œ in the school, when they were doing these operations, did you suddenly feel like something was wrong with you, that you Œ before, you didn™t feel like anything was bad about you, and then now somebody™s telling you you™re no good. Is that Œ was that Œ A: Later, I woke up, when I realized it was because I couldn™t hear. I was really very innocent, when I was younger. Q: So in fact, she didn™t know why they were doing the operation? A: Just so Œ I Œ I knew that they were doing the operation so I couldn™t have children to perpetuate deafness . Q: Okay. So she did know why. A: Yes, I knew why they were doing the operation. Q: Okay. Do you have any more questions that you™d like to know about this? Cause really, I pretty much got everything. No, I™m asking you, Ronnie (ph). Q2: Oh. Interview with Helga Gross January 22, 2003 20 Q3: I have one [indecipherable] Q: Okay, yeah. Q2: I had Œ I had a few, but Œ Q3: The Œ there was the conversation about some papers that she carried with her for a long time, and then were torn up, and I never quite understood what those papers were. But apparently they were bad papers, the Americans tore them up. Can you explain what the papers were? A: It said that Œ it said that it was Œ I was a member of the Nazi party, because I was a Girl Scout. So those Œ those papers that I carried said I Œ I was a leader of the Girl Scouts, and so I had to carry those papers that said I was a member of the Nazi party. I really wasn™t, but that™s what the papers said. They were forcing me to go, to join, but in the back of my head, I knew, God helped pull me back. I would not go in. I had the papers to become a member, but I wouldn™t do it. And every day when I would walk from the house to the job, and the Œ I would pass by the soldiers, I would just feel the fear that they might ask if I was a member or not. And for years, this went on. After am Œ America claimed Germany , that™s when I felt like a bird, free, I could fly free. Q: But the papers said she was a member of the Nazi party? Interview with Helga Gross January 22, 2003 21 A: They weren™t filled in. The papers were not filled in, I just carried them with me. There were no answers, and I hadn™t signed the papers, so they didn™t really say anything. I didn™t sign them. An American soldier said I must go to my boss, and ask for a file, to see if I had anything on my record, but I had a clean record. There was Œ the Nazi had a huge file in the basement, and they found papers. And then because I knew some of Œ some of the people, some of my friends™ uncles or nephews, they came to the Œ from Bulgaria to the United States , and they said, do you remember Œ and they asked him, were you a member of the Nazi party? And they denied it, so they said, okay, you™re accepted. And then they could support these people when they came to America . When you went to the American consulate, you had to take an oath to tell the truth. And they asked, are you a member of the Nazi party. And somebody confessed to saying yes, they took their file, they put their name in the file. So I was afraid that that same thing would happen to me, so I never signed those papers. Q: Ronnie (ph), do you have any questions that Œ that arose during this? Q2: As a deaf woman, did you know German sign language? And then how, when you came to America , did you learn American sign language? A: I would meet friends, and I asked them to help me , and I Œ I picked up a dictionary, English -German, German and English, so I could learn different signs. Interview with Helga Gross January 22, 2003 22 And the Lutheran preacher at the church, I asked him to come to my aunt and uncle™s house to teach me finger spelling and sign language, for one year. And that™s how I learned. Q: What happened to your brother, with regard to the sterilization? Was he supposed to be sterilized also? A: No, he Œ they didn™t sterilize him, he has twin daughters. They™re both hearing. Beautiful girls. He was lucky. Q: How Œ how did he manage to escape Œ A: He didn™t avoid it, he was supposed to go to the hospital, but the hospital was full, and it was wartime. And then he Œ soldiers and people were being rushed to the hospital. There was no available space for him, so he didn™t go, they did not sterilize him. He was very happy. Q: Did you Œ did you Œ did your parents Œ A: I was happy. People would ask me, do you feel bad that your brother has two children, you don™t have any? No, I™m very happy that he has twins. I™m just happy that I have two beautiful nieces. Q: Did Œ did Œ did the Œ did any health officials, or anyone come to your family to explain that they thought deafness was hereditary? A: No, nothing. Interview with Helga Gross January 22, 2003 23 Q: There was no conver Œ da Œ discussions about that? A: When I was 28 years old, I came to the United States . It™s a Œ Germany , during wartime, was different. It was very Œ a very rough life over there , but it was different here. Q: But when you were going through this operation, or when they took Œ when they took you for this operation, did anybody explain that deafness was hereditary, and this was something that they had to do, or Œ A: No, nothing. Nothing was explained. Only once did the teacher say, tol Œ tell us that you can™t have babies, we™re going to make you not have babies, so that the deafness doesn™t become perpetuated, and that was it. Just one time. And we didn™t have any time really, to focus on it. It was a very confusing time for all of us. All the time, confusion. Now, you™re maki ng me look back on it in more Œ more in depth. I didn™t realize about the deaf world itself back then. So they would call some of them mentally retarded. They would mainstream them in a church. Oh, all of us, deaf people, mentally retarded people, they would put them Œ there was a church, and a lot of the people died, from fire. Most of them were mentally retarded. They would take them away to this church. And years later, some of the kids were still alive. Most, if they were deaf, they were allowed to go to the church. Interview with Helga Gross January 22, 2003 24 They were healthy, except they just couldn™t hear. And so they would send them off, on their way. Q: To where? A: You know, to Œ to the gas chambers, to the camps. I didn™t know where they were really taking them. One boy came from Guatemala , South America . His father sent him to school for the deaf. He was two or three years older than me. He went out of class from school. He liked me. He explained all about the Nazis, and how bad it was, and I learned a lot from him. And I said, how do you know? And he said, his uncle took care of him, and his father stayed in South America , and his uncle took care of him. His uncle told him about the Nazis. And they said they will kill everybody. All the German kids. They™ll sterilize all the German kids. He knew so much. That™s when we all Œ I started to become afraid, and he was fearful as well. I talked to my father, and he would just try to pacify me, and calm me down. He™d say, don™t worry, don™t worry. My father was very sensitive. My father™s sister, my aunt Œ and I asked my aunt, I said, is Hitler bad?
