Q: Yeah. 12 A: They -- they picked one guy, and they told him that we gonna save you, you are gonna be saved. And you go to the ghetto, and bring us money, gold, clothes, whatever. Every day he came to the ghetto and he said that we should bring that to -- to him. Q: A Jew? This is a -- A: Yes. Q: -- the head of the -- th e head of the Judenrat? A: Yes. Q: Earlier I showed you a picture of five men, was one of those men a -- a member of the Jewish council, do you think? A: No. No, no. I met Moishe Smollo after -- afte r the war.

Q: You and -- and your family escaped the ghetto, is that correct? A: Escaped? Q: Escaped the ghetto? A: No, no. We were in ghetto. Next to our ghetto we had a building with Russian prisoners, and they were wounded. And we had a doctor, Dr. Wollash. I h -- I don™t remember what I did yesterday, but I remember his name, and he was a doctor and he used to go every d -- every day and take care of them, whoever was needed a nd wounded. And he was going to their -- to the -- to their building and one day he comes in and -- and one day he comes in there, and a Russian prisoner says, doc, I gotta tell you a secret, but don™t you dare tell -- tell that I told you. And he says, well, what™s that secret? He says they™r e digging graves in Cusack and in a day or two they™re gonna have liquidation for the ghetto. So he came to the ghe tto and he says, in Jewish, 13 kinderloch, run, because so and so and whatever. So my parents heard that and they -- they had a Ukraine family that they had no children, and they said -- my parents gave them money, gold, and whatever, jewelry, and they promised that they gonna save me and my older brother. And my mother and dad said that we should go ther e. And I said, no, I™m not going. If they going to kill you, I™m not going. I™m staying here. And well, wh en my mother said something like that, I ignored her, but when the da -- when my dad said something, it meant business. And she started to pack for me that we are leaving. And I sa ys, if I go, I am not taking nothing, and I™m not going. And they said, no, we made arrangement s, and you and your brother are gonna go there, and she™s gonna save us. And well, I said, I guess we have to go. And it got dark, it got maybe eight o™clock, nine o™clock, I™m not sure, and we ran out from the ghetto. The ghetto was not wired, you can go. And we heard shooting. Somebody was shooting, and we hid under a bush. And then there was a -- I remember, was a -- like a -- not a -- pond, or what, and you had to cross that in order to run away, and we jumped over there, and I was 10 years old, 11 years old, I didn't know how to swim, and my brother pulled me out by my hair, and we -- he was a -- a man, a boy, and he stronger than I am, he knew how to swim, and he saved me. And we ran over that water, or whatever, I di -- I can™t tell you what it was. And we were hiding under that bush. And we went, we ran. It took us more than an hour, two hours to get to that -- to those people. And we came and it was already 10 o™clock. We knocked in the door, and we said, we came to you, and we didn™t say nothing, killing or whatever. And sh e said, oh my God, oh my God. And she said - we said, we like to stay here for a day or two. And she says, oh, okay, then you can go in the barn and hi -- and sleep there. And we did. And in the morning she came, and she says, I heard that they killed already, everybody in Koretz. It™s -- everybody™s killed. And -- and we started to cry, and we knew that that™s it, they killed our parents and the two brothers. And every morning 14 she would come in and tell us that we must l eave because they gonna find out that she is hiding Jews, then they gonna kill her. And that was ev ery morning. And she would bring us a piece of bread and a glass of milk. And anyway, I told my brother, I™m leaving. I can™t stay here. And he says, well, there™s nothing we can do. And I wa -- in the morning, I got up, and I says, I™m going. Because she would come in and she said we must leave. And I said good-bye and I walk out from that barn, and I didn™t know where to go, be cause we were border with Russia, and that was Russia til 1939, and we were Ukraine Poland. And I -- I says, what do I do? Where do I go? And I went the other way, where Ukraine. And I walked and walked, and where I™m going, I don™t know. I walked for a couple hours, and I saw two men working on field. And I walked over, and I told them, my name is Manya, and I™m from a village, and I have no mother. My mother died, and my dad remarried, and I have a stepmother and she doesn™t want me, and I™m looking for to be a maid. Maybe you know who needs a maid. A nd he says to me, aren™t you Jewish? And I says no, I™m not. And he says, well, if you wait an hour or so til I finish my work, I think my neighbor may hire you. I said okay. Didn™t eat nothing, nervous, scared, don™t know what™s gonna happen. And he went into the house and he wrote the address, and made a little map for me. And he says, go there, he is my neighbor , he might hire you. And I did follow the map. Where I™m going I don™t know, but finally I did fi nd th-there, the neighbor. And it was kind of dark. I came in, I knock on the door, and I show him the na -- the piece of paper, and he says to me, aren™t you Jewish? And I said, no, I™m not. And she says, well, what can you do? What do you want to get paid? I said, a piece of bread. And she said, what can you do? And I says, try me. And she says, okay. And I stayed there. Every day, are you Jewish, are you -- your mother was Jewish? I said no, not at all. And I worked very hard.
