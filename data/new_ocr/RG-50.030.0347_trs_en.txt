Q: What town in Poland? A: In Poland, Szczecin. Q: Tell me a little bit about your family and Szczecin. A: I came from a family, eight child ren. Five brothers and three sist ers. The name was Morris, this was the older brother. Bernard, Eshod Baruch. My sister, Bella. My brother, Gustav. My sister, Fia Bella. My brother, Ira Eres h (ph). And my younge r sister was Freda Frencha (ph), and I was the youngster, David. Devid in Jewish. My fa ther was -- my father was a businessman. He manufactured shoes in the neigh borhoods. My mother was a housewife, and she was a member of the sisterhood. And her job was -- they call this chevra kadisha, in tran slation, it means when a woman die, and the Jewish faith has to perform a ritu al service. Only peop le can do this service who are very religious in ritual and knowing the Bible a nd be any Orthodox saint. September 8, 1939, before was rumo rs the Germans, they try occupy Poland, but two weeks in advanc e, there was serious rumors. And people, they try in a way to prepare themselves becau se they know who the Germans they are. Q: Now, I'd like to stop you a moment. Just ask you a little bit more about life before the Germans came in. A: Please. Q: You came from an Orthodox home? A: Right. Q: Did you have contact with the Gentiles or you kept pretty much to yourself? 2 A: No, no, no. We was in contact with the -- our neighbors. They were Gentiles, and we lived in very harmony condition, whatever. No, condition is not enough a sp ecial word. We lived in very good terms with our neighbors, with our Gentile neighbors. They tried -- some, they try very much to help. Some like everything else, it was very bad ones who try to cooperate with the Germans. Q: As a boy, did you know of anti-Semitism? A: Poland was a very extraordinary country, what people all over the world could not understand about Poland. Poland was a good country. The government went by the name, by the President, when was -- the name was Pilsudski . He was a very fine, extraord inary president for the people. The people, they -- I cannot say in general the people was bad people. We got good and bad ones in any nation. However, Po land went through a catac lysm, they always got the wars because they was in the middle between Russia and Germany and Austria, all the borders. And they always, every 20 years, every 40 years, always a revolution or war. Poland never got a chance to straighten out themself and to be original, really independent. Q: But before the war, yo u had a pretty nice life? A: Yes. My father was a businessm an, like I said. He was -- we were , all the kids they worked very hard. We never looked something for nothing. We was very indepe ndent. My father give away a lot of charity to Jewish organizations and Gentile organizations, alike. And about myself, I went to Yeshiva. This means Orthodox sc hool. Later when I got older, I went to a Gentile school. I graduate from high school. After I graduate, my parents and myself, they try to send me to law school which I attended two years. After sch ool, I was sitting in courthouse, and listen cases. I could not accomplish my mission be cause the Germans, they came and they destroy our life, our country, our families. For a while, I saved my parents, my brothers and sisters, before the war they left to France. And I was myself home, try to work older brother, with two older brothers, with Gustav and Baruch. Late r the Nazis came, they occupied, because Szczecin was a strategic point close to the borders, the German borders. From us to Germany could be 15 minutes. Some areas was written, signs in stores was written in two languages: Polish and Germ an. So tight we was close to the German borders. On September 8, I was in a spot they called this Chachiramia (ph). 3 This was a street by the name like Beverly Hills, and all of a sudden -- I walk with a Gentile person, with our neighbor's son, and all of a sudden, came about approximatel y in my estimati on is about 2 or 4,000 airplanes in the air. Very low and below was maybe 10, 000 motorcycles on the bottom. And the airplanes, they tried to protect those motorcycles if maybe the opponents, they will fight back immediately. Nothing happened. They went through. In three days or four days, they occupied all Poland. Later they -- Poland was divided. The Germans, they divided Poland in ghettos, in camps, and they make Ló dz was the biggest ghetto in th e United States. Excuse me, in Poland. Pardon me, in Poland. Later they open up ghettos in every city, approximately in every city. A ghetto, to inform you better, is like this: Th ey select six, seven street s, big streets, and they close up on both sides. And they concentrate all those people in this particular street, in those streets. And they have to live inside, sleep, and do work, undern ourished. The minimum, very minimum amount food. And everyt hing under terror. Mostly they got bottles would send and water. Bottles, regular bottles. If he don't like you face or he don't like you, he just bend you in half with a bottle of water or they se nd. You be dead on the spot. Maybe they take you out and they throw you away, we don't know wher e they put those people. This was the most barbarian time in 3,000 years. Never was somethin g, what I saw for my own eyes. Q: What happened after the motorcycles and the ai rplanes, what happened to you next? Did you hide? A: The next step was the Germans in a month later, maybe three weeks later to recognize every Jew to be a Jew, and to terror -- to terrorize the Jewish people. So they put in a Star of David, a yellow Star of David, and this was the re cognition, this you a Jew. Because I was a different Jew myself. A different Jew means some Jewish people, they ga ve up. I did not. I don 't put on the Star of David, and I was mixed in with Gentiles. And th ey could not recognize me or I am a Jew or a Gentile. Q: Wasn't that risky? A: This is dead on the spot, or I don't care. If I die, I die or I die as a Jew with pride. Q: How did you know which Gentiles to trust? 4 A: Good question. There was a big station and a big, tremendous street to the station. Hitler came and hold a speech. Approximately, it was 10 or 15,000 people in this area, concentrate, listen to speech. Q: Do you remember when this was? A: This was later -- this was in December. It was cold. This is the reason I remember it was December. In Poland December is very cold, snow, rain, misera ble days. I was standing with Germans shoulder with shoulder. He brought his gr oup, the SA, SS, and I was standing there. They don't know I am a Jew. Nobody could recognize me becaus e I was dressed an d combed like a German. And I know the style because I was born in this area. I know how the Germans, they dress. How they do it. And I re member one phrase -- I speak Germ an myself. Should I tell you the phrase? Q: If you translate it. A: I will translate you. Ven de lieber Gott (ph). If God help us in Poland, he will help us in France. This means he said in German, "God help us to occupy Poland. The next will be France." In his speech, this phrase. And I was st anding arm and shoulder and shoulder in the mi ddle. Nobody. As a matter of fact, some Germans, they just mumbling against those speeches. Those speech, what he was holding. They cannot talk. If he talk right aw ay, he be in jail for 15 years or they shoot him on the spot, whatever it is. Or this is a Gentle, or Jew, whatever it is. This was their policy, nobody can be against me or against our system or against our program. Q: What did it feel like being in this crowd? A: The feeling is just like they take somebody to the electric chair in a civilized country, and ten minutes before he get electrocuted they ask him, "What is your wish?" One guy said, "I'd like to hear a symphony." Another guy, he sa id, "I'd like to have a better meal ," or whatever it is. What his desire is. My desire is to see how the Germans get back what they deserve, wh at they did to that civilized people all over the world. Anyhow, I tried to protect my one brother and his famil y. I lost everybody, they went to Fr ance and later I got no contact with th em. I tried to help out because my brother, he was six feet and two inches tall, and he got four kids. And in cluded my parents, my 5 father and my mother, try put them in a separate spot. And I tried to hidden them maybe for nine months after I put them in a spot , in a room, of course . And I paid a Gentile money not to, you know. And I brought them food an d whatever they need the most. And after this I got no choice no more. So I did before I lost th em, there was big house, a big home with a big yard you could take in about 2,000 people. So they put in 2,000 Jewish families, singles , whatever it is, Jewish people, included my father. Got caught and they got them inside. My brother got inside. So I went -- let's see, this is the area over here where they concentrated 2,000. And the neighbor wall, so I work about night time between one and three o'clock in the morning, nobody knows. And I took out bricks -- you know, Europe houses, they build from bricks. So I to ok out the bricks, brick by brick, until I make a big hole. And I went inside and I put on Yuder, the St ar of David. Because without a star, I could not go in. Not in, because not through the front doorwell, everyb ody can go in and out. So I make a hole, and I was inside . And you can imagine for your ow n eyes what's go ing on inside with those people. People automatically lost their mind. They lost thei r faith in life. They got nothing for one minute in mind, they will survive or they can live, or they let them live. So I took my father because every dead person who dies inside, they took them out in like a pushcart. So I took my father and make believe he's dead on the pushcart, and I got him out from the house. And I locate him in a spot; later I came to my brother, and I tried to get him out. And my brother, he was a very strong person. And I said, "Come on, I take you out. I got a spot, I take you out." He said, "I gave up. I gave up." And ther e was not too much time to convince him, "What are you doing?" And I got my father out, and him, he don't want to go out. And he was a big smoker, smoking. He said, "The only thing what you can do for me, bri ng me a cigarette. Bring me a cigarette, please. You save my life, bring me a ciga rette." I said, "Come on out. I give you ten packages cigarette. Come on out." I try again and again and again. I could not convince him. And I got out my father, and I got out his wife with the kids. And he, no way; I could not convince him. And people so when I took out all those, my fath er and my sister-in-law with the kids, so they tried to do the same thing to get out from this. After this happened, I run away. Of cour se, let them do. The first three, four people I helped them out, to get out. Late r I don't want to risk my head, and I went and I 6 brought food for my sister-in-law w ith the kids and for my father w ith my mother. My mother start to be . . . [Interview stops here] End of Tape 1. 7 Tape 2 Q: So you were sent to Marx-Sta dt. Now, how did you get there? A: By a transport. They pick up the last group in the city about 150 left over. Excuse me. Q: Bless you. A: They pick up the last group. They call this the last transport, and they brought not by -- railroad, transportation railroads. What they do -- I forgot my -- cargo. And they put in those people in those wagons, and they sent them. Marx-Stadt is close to Brasov. So they 150 people and those 150 people, when we came was a bout couple thousand people already. They divide us in group, and they start building barracks. They called this like over here mobile homes; they called it a barrack. And they put in in a ba rrack 45, 50 people with bunk beds . After they ac cumulate those people, we start building ________ , the first camp. In English translation is the five lakes, Funfteichen. The five lakes, this is approx imately close 25 miles fr om Brasov. And . . . Q: This is part of Marx-Stadt? A: Marx-Stadt, further up north. Q: It's part of the same organization? A: Right. To Marx-Stadt was the preparation to build the concentrat ion camps. What is difference between Marx-Stadt, between a camp and a concentration camp? In a concentration camp, you cannot go one inch without control, in a concentra tion camp. And everything is by order, and the language is impossible to explain to you what kind which they took to those people. They took like animals, and Funfteichen so I wasn't ________ a year. After a year, they sent me to -- Alliance Russia and the United States, they agreed to bomb ard Germany. So they start bombarding 24 hours a day, the Russian s and Germans. Q: The Russians and the Americans? A: The Russians and the Americans, together against Germany, beca use after the war in Russia this is the reason they start to be mad on the Germans. So later they cooperated, those two; later France and England. They make the Alliance Group, and they found a solution just to bombard them 24 hours a day. 8 Q: Now, I'm going to ask you, because I'm a little bit confused. A: Okay. Q: So you're saying that this Funfteichen . . . A: Funfteichen. Five lakes. Q: . . . is -- was a part of Marx-Stadt. You were in this one area about one year? No? A: Marx-Stadt was a preparation camp to build conc entration camps in the Silesia area. Silesia is Ober Silesia. They call this Ober Silesian, Silesia. Brasov, before the war, was Germany. About 50 years, Brasov was Poland. So they annexe d -- the Polish annexed, they annexed Poland and Brasov back to Poland on this side, and Poland give up on the south borders to Germany. So we -- from Marx-Stadt, we was a gro up what we build those camps, and they send the group to Funfteichen to build the mobile homes. Like over here, mobile homes, because the camps. Q: So how much time were at Marx-Sta dt and how much time in the other? A: I was in Marx-Stadt a year. I was in Funfteichen a year. Q: So when you were in Marx-Stadt, they would send you out to build places? A: Right. Q: And then you slept in Marx-Stadt ? Where you stayed every night, it was in Marx-Stadt that first year? A: Of course. If was in the camp under superv ision under the Nazis SA, the same thing. The privilege what we got because we went groups, 25 -- let's see, my company was the name. You can put it in, Dr. Visner (ph) . If you ask me what I had for breakfas t, I don't remember today. And this company I remember very well, beca use what this company did to me , I tell you later. Anyhow, the companies we make for Funfteichen blocks, concrete blocks , to make the camps attach, because everything was wild. Like in a desert . They give us, let's see, about 40 acres land, raw. We have to make plumbing. We have to make sidewalks. We have a million things to live, according their definition, they should live like this. Anyhow, we did, and this what we did just to show the hierarchies because many de legations came from Switzerland. And they want see what happen with those people. When they came, we eat on the -- before they came, we eat on the floor. When the 9 delegations came, the mixed delegations, later they put in to eat on the table. They showed them we not animals; they treat us beauti ful. We can eat by the table. Q: So there were all these visiting delegations? A: Twice a year. Once a year. Sometimes three times a year. Q: Who were the workers, the ot her prisoners in this camp? Were they all from your area? A: It was concentrate people from all walk of life. From all Euro pe, except Asia. I can go far how many -- I speak six languages. As far as I'm co ncerned, I met six languages. Besides the six languages, I met people with different languages and I could not understand. Q: Just in these two camps? A: Not only these two camps. Q: Okay. But that 's what we're ta lking about now. A: We talk about from Marx-Stadt, they send us to Funfteichen. In Funfteichen, we start civilize to make, you know -- from naked land, we make those camps. To make, let's see, about 50, 60 camps. Q: That you worked on? A: Yes. After this, people came from all over the world. From Hungar ian, from Czechoslovakian, from Belgium, from Holland, from Luxembourg, from France, from Jebuti (ph) , from Corsica, from -- I remember I spoke with a guy from Hasidaean. He was Jew, Hasidaean Jews. They speak just Hebrew. I spoke with him Hebrew, and I find out, "Where you from?" Is black Jews, I never know this, they exist, black Jews before the war. And I met him because he was visiting in France, and during the time he got caught by a Jewish fam ily. And they send him like everything away. Q: So you built -- you helped build a lot of camps in this area? A: That's right. Q: Now, at this time were ther e any efforts for people like y ourself to try to escape this? A: Now, I will tell you a story. You remind me about escaping. From Funfteichen, I tried to escape, and one time I run away from the ca mp was between according to imagination was approximately 6 o'clock European time. And I wal k, I never got shave. I look, you know, like a rabbi, and I wear stripes. This was -- I forgot. I give you a correction. Between a camp, 10 Funfteichen -- between Funfte ichen, grows rows and things like th is. In Funfteichen, in Marx-Stadt, you wear clothing, plain clothing -- any clothing. Wh en you went to concentration camp to Funfteichen, you went a uniform. They give you a uniform to recognize you, you a prisoner. You understand? Because we was builders, and over here in concentration alread y. This was the difference, the uniform, stripes. Th ey called this a possack (ph), stri pes blue and white, whatever it is. Now, where I am now? About run away. I r un away 6 o'clock in the evening, and I came to a spot by myself. I came to a spot north, south, ea st, west, and I'm in the middle. And I said to myself, "What the hell should I do with myself? Where should I go ?" Go this way, maybe I get caught over here. Maybe go south, they catch me over here. Till I see a little light, like from the mountains. You see a little light like a candle, candlelight. And I sa id to myself, "I take a chance. I go where the light is." When I ca me to the light, close to the light, so I knocked the door where the light is. Was an old lady, and sh e was knitting a sweater or whatever it is, and I ask her in this part they speak German. And I speak German, so I ask her, "Can you tell me where the police is over here?" When I asked her police, so she know I am not a criminal. Do you understand what I am talking to you? I ask her where are the police is ov er here, and they told me the police, you have to go over here two miles is the po lice, or three miles. I don't remember exactly. She give me direction how to go. Wherever she go, I went the opposite. That road to the pol ice, to get caught. When I went when she opened the door for me and she gave me th e direction, so I asked her, "Maybe you have something to eat. " She said, "I have no bread." I asked her for bread, and she said, "I have cake." Mostly, in Europe they ba ke, you know, cake. They call this in Czechish, the call this moksha (ph). In this area, they speak German an d Czech, Slovak ish. She said, "________________." "I have cake. " I said, "Okay." I never saw cake for five years. And she give me the cake. When she give me the cake, I said, "Can I ha ve some water?" Everybody give you water. And I got water and ca ke. Later I start to be too fres h and I ask if she can give me a razor blade to just cut it up, the whole thing, and to run away further. She give me a razor blade, she was by herself. Later she got -- she was so nice to me. God should remember this woman. Later she said to me a story what happ ened with her. Her daughter's husband, he was an SS man, and he 11 went to the army. All the families, they're for f our years, five years in the army, and she hated Germans. You never believe it, they called this -- we was originally I was Sudeten-Deutschland. This is between Czechs and German y. And they speak, yo u know, both languages. I spoke with her, and she was very nice. She gi ve me a razor blades and everything. Later I said to myself, "I got a piece cake, and I got water, and I got a razor blade. The onl y solution to the problem, you better go back to the camp, because I get killed, I know. " So I want you to listen with both ears this situation. All of a sudden, two more boys, they are run away from the camp, and I met those two guys. Till there was three; three is no good. To o many is no good. There was three. And all of a sudden, we came close, came a -- they called this an SI -- they got SS, they got the black over here, the storm troopers. And the other one was SA, was the yellow uniforms, a different uniform. And the guy came was just in yellow, a local guy. He came, "Wha t the hell you guys doing over here? Where do you come from?" Told him we get out, we bandits. Th ey got all -- I got shaved; they don't. So he said, "What kind nationality is?" One guy said, "I am Polish." The other guy said, "I am Lithuanian," whatever it is. Wh en he came to me, I said, "I am a Jew." You have to excuse me, the guy who said Lithuania n, he said, "Put on the pants. Open the pants, put it on. I want to see are you circumcised." He wants to see, he knows they are Jewish people, they circumcised. When he did this, he saw the guys, they was circumcised. So they both, they told him a lie. He said he's a Ukrainian, or whatever it is, and I said I'm a Jew. So he said to the guys, "Open yo ur mouth." He killed them on the spot, both. Both they got killed. After the liberation, I went to looking for. Are they still, or they put him away? And because I told the truth, I am a Jew, I survived. They let me live because I don't lie to them. Q: How did you know to do that? A: Excuse me? Q: How did your instinct s tell you to do that? A: You know, this is a very long story to tell you how inst inct. When you came to a situation, every creature, every human being, everyt hing what is life, take a look at the guy got shot down with the airplane. The guy, for five days, he ate worms. Did you hear what the guy said on television? He 12 ate worms, he got no food. He survived. Later they pick him up and th ey found him, and they brought him back. When you came to a situation like this, is no diplomacy. Is no knowledge, is no study. You could be edu cated, you could be the bigg est idiot in -- the instinct for yourself dictate you what you should do. And this is life, nothing else. Not beca use I was smart or smarter than those two guys. I told him I am a Jew, I am not ashamed I am a Jew. In Marx-Stadt, I go back to Marx-Stadt, to my boss where I went to work, Dr. Visner. Till we got on e foreman, a German, from the company, from Dr. Visner's company. He got a two-by-four stick, two-by-four, he could grab it, you know, and this. And one time he came to me. He said, "You was talking politic," to me. He slapped me in the face, and he repo rt me and hit me in the head over here. You see over here? Can you see where he hit me? It was bloody, blood and everyt hing, okay. Try to why he hit me, and I figured out forget it. Those work this way. In Marx-Stadt when you wa s -- our group was about, let's see, what we were productive is we make those cinder blocks. So was maybe eight or ten, a small group. In the morning when we left the gate, the guy put on number 1180. Numbers, you are number, not a name. Just a number. They put on the numbers. When you come back, you get the numbers back. And he registered, he see all the registered the same amount people, they don't run away or whatever it is. So the same guy who hit me with the two-by-fours, he report to the Ustachi (ph). Ustachi means the leader from the camp in Marx-Stadt. Q: Jewish or not Jewish? A: Jewish, not Jewish, was mixed. Or the guy, the leader, he was Je wish. He got a leather jacket, a pair of boots. He looked like an SS man. Really -- a real animal. But this guy came, so this guy who hit me with the two-by-four, he report to the Ustachi. All the complaints go to the Ustachi, to this guy. So he got guys, kapos, whatever they receive complaints, they take them in and they put them on a bench. When I ca me in and the Ustachi, this guy, the fi rst thing. Guilty or not guilty? No way, you are not going. First he slapped me in the face. I fa ll on the floor. The guy was a husky, strong guy. When I fell on the floor, he said -- I don't to me ntion the language what he said translate into English, because I will be embarr assed for a lady to say what he said. Something extraordinary language. So he said to those kapos, he said, "Pull down the pa nts. Open the pants. 13 Pull down the pants. Lay down on the bench." Th ey got a bench like this. And they gave me 50, how should I say it? I lost my language, my vocabulary. Fifty punches on my hinter. For your information, on the end I could not stand up. So he throw me down on the floor, lie down like a dog. They will not do this to a dog. And later he said, "Stand up, you bitch," you know. He said, "Stand up. Stand up. Stand up." And I can stand up and I stand up. My hint er, you have to excuse me, was -- how should I give you a description how it was? Ink, red ink, the whole thing. He said, you know, "Come tomorrow to work. You go on the company _______." This means on the phylactery, you know, they got a room. Lay down in the bed, and from this bed people who don't go to work, they send to Auschwitz , for your information. Because they need over here people to go to work, because this is a working camp, not a concentration camp . A working camp. So I was two days -- a miracle was they don' t send me to Auschwitz, and I went to work the third day. I was praying to God to go to work. When I came to work and the same guy who hit me with the two-byfour, he said, "You know what you did? You was listen illegal radio, news about the Germans, that they lost the war." I said, "I never -- how you go t that idea? You could not even explain? You can't even talk?" He said he had to listen, not hing else. So this wa s the two experiences the direction run away and got killed two guys, and I survived. The guy, he came, he said I was listening to illegal radio about the war. Q: Were you? A: We was talk about politic s, the Germans has to lose. Q: But you didn't have a radio? A: Positively no. This was a false thing to do. Q: When you were in Funfteichen . . . A: Funfteichen, yes. Q: . . . Funfteichen, excuse me , were you doing the same kind of work there that you had been doing when you started in Marx-Stadt? A: It's very hard to understand. A person like you to understand th is. Marx-Stadt was a preliminary spot to build those camps for the concentration camps. We was a regular crew. Some, they was a 14 group from roofers. Some was plumbers. I work in the cinder blocks, in concrete. Some was painters. Some was framers. Some was -- everyb ody got a different group, working group. So we was not dressed like concentration people. We wa s dressed civil clothing, and in concentration camp everybody got marks, stripes. Q: I understand that. Let's change tape while we . . . Q: . . . what I want -- what we were talking about when we stopped is the difference between MarxStadt and Funfteichen. And what I understand is when you were th en sent to Funfteichen because your work was done from the other camp, what you did ev ery day in Funfteichen. A: Daily routine things. Q: Like? A: Every block, every block means every mobile home. Mobile home is easy to understand for you. Q: Well, you said barrack, it's a barrack. A: Is a barrack, right. Everybody has 45, 50 people. This barr ack has to clean the barrack, clean the landscaping. Looks beautiful for the delegations, to show how good they treat those people. How nice they lie to people. Everything is clean up. A million things. From Funfteic hen, I was over a year. Then I went to Gross-Ro sen in 1944. Gross-Rosen is an additional 45, 50 miles from this territory. So what they did, because the German f eel, they get tighter with the war. The Russian, Americans, they don't let them breathe; 24 hours a day, every da y 2 o'clock in the morning, you can see for yourself the lights. Because we was in shelters, but they bo mbard. So they throw it out to shelters, so they came an d they line up all the areas and they saw people in uniforms. Didn't throw one bomb. They throw bombs just where they -- so this is not the cam p. Well, I saw my eye 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock, because I saw them. They run, boy, they light up like da ylight. You could never believe this. Q: What were you thinking when you saw all these? A: Later I start organize -- not officially -- step by step, groups. And I said to the guys, "Something is to the end." And they said -- some, they said, "Aah, you're dreami ng. We finish sooner or later." 15 Okay, if I see a guy, he lost the marbles and he never think about what will be the future with the Germans, I know. Because I belie ve in the Ten Commandm ents, this is in my heart, not in the Bible. Ten Commandments is my Bible, I believe. And I got this in mind. Got to come, the day must come -- this is unbelievable. This must come the day. At th e end of '44, we start up '45, and we see they got it so smacked is after GrossRosen, we walk -- we sleep in the street. Q: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You have n't told me anything about Gross-Rosen. A: In Gross-Rosen was a transit ca mp. No work, nothing doing. Wa it for a transit. You understand transit, what it mean? Of a group to go. So they collect 500 or 1,000 groups walking, not travel. Because is no time, the Germans go t no time to locate those people, because gets tougher and tougher and tougher for them. So from Gross-Rosen . . . Q: So you were just there a short time? A: So I was maybe a week. Q: And this was in the begi nning of 1945, you think? A: In the beginning. End of '44, beginning of '45. Q: Okay. A: So the biggest tragedy was in Gross-Rosen, do you know what they did? They took 3 or 4,000 people outside, and they count the people maybe nine times. They could not count it. They know how to count it to make people miserable. So we're standing abou t three hours counting: one, two, three, four, five, 5,000 people. Y ou can imagine, and go ba ck: one, two, three, four, five, six, and to count to 5,000. Cold, rain, snow, miserable. And you got the shoes, th ey got, you know, from the wooden -- they call this -- from wood. The sole was from wood. When you step in in snow, you got a popped up snow underneath, and this gets stiff. So you get -- you get not only crooked feet. You cannot walk. And later we sleep. Everybody when we left, the first thing we took was blanket. We took the blanket. Y ou got a blanket, he got a blanket. So we took three blankets, three people. We covered up, and on the snow for thre e, for four, for five days. I don't remember exactly. This was a short notice. And from Gross-Ro sen, we went to Buchenwald. In Buchenwald . . . 16 Q: How long -- I'm sorry. How long did it take you to walk there? A: To Buchenwald? I don't know, I really don't remember if we walk or we travel in those transportation wagons; I think we walk. I cannot remember. Q: You were with a la rge group of people? A: Thousands. Th ousands of people. Q: Did everyone make it? A: If you couldn't make it, he fall on the floor, an d they pick him up a nd throw him away like another human being. Who know where? We ca me to Buchenwald, it was a big camp. Organized camp by nationalities. The French camp, the Polish camp, Internat ional camp and this. You could, in Buchenwald, you was flexible. I could go to the French camp an d talk with the guys. No camp you could talk to -- from one camp, if you belong to this camp , you stay with this camp. You cannot talk to strangers or something else. In Buchenwald was -- maybe this was on the end. Because it gets closer, closer, closer. And . . . Q: So there you could move around? A: Yes. Q: And was it all men or were there women, too? A: Was women in a se parate shelter. Q: So where were you living there? A: In a barrack. Q: With the people from where? A: Who knows who they are? All kind of nationa lity, mixed. I could get along because I speak languages. Some they got problems, talk by hand. Like this, this, you know. If you don't know language, you're lost. Q: What were the co nditions like there? A: The conditions was kapos, same kapos. Just kapos, also tough, although not so rough than the other kapos. They wake you up 2 o'clock in the mo rning in Buchenwald. They came for inspection or everybody is inside. They count them, just no nsense. They know this. Where do you run away? 17 Where do you go? To China? An d they just make people misera ble. Wake up not to sleep and this. In Buchenwald -- because my feeling is because this was the end. Very cl ose to the end. Every night, every night you see hundreds of airpla nes light up like the daytime, like over here. You could see everything. They do n't throw one bomb on to, you know , to kill those -- they call us katsetlers (ph). This means the concentration camps. And until some people, they got free 1945 in May, and some people, they got fr ee in April. Depended how the Ge rmans, they call that. From Buchenwald -- wait a minute -- from Buchenwald, they pi ck up us and they ask who's professional people. So I said I was an assistan t to a doctor. So they pick up and they send us to Theresienstadt. Q: Now, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I really have some more questions . . . A: Please. Q: . . . about Buchenwald. You were there how long, do you think? How many months? A: In Buchenwald, I was seven months. Q: Oh, a long time. A: Maybe six months, I cannot remember . . . Q: Did you do any work there? A: Always. Q: What kind? Same thing? A: Cleaning, the washroom. We went to take sh owers. Should I give you a little portray and a little episode about the washrooms? Okay. They put in 25 guys naked, and the showers came from the ceiling, the showers. And one kapo, one animal or two, if you don't st ay exactly what he says where it's supposed to be. So he throw dishes, wash dishes. Every dish we got hit in the head, you have to go to the hospital. You got your head opened. Inside was really a massacre if you're going for the washroom. If you're go ing inside, you see someth ing you never believe this in your life. How everything organized was, what the Nazis what they did to the civilization to people, to civilized people. After this you as k them what can work. We have to clean up the washro om. We have to make hot the water, which it never was. Cold water in winter. Wh en you go in, you start to just shake like this, it's number one. Maybe they gi ve you ten drops hot water. And you walk out, 18 nothing to wipe up yourself. You just wait until you dry off yourself. They give you soap. The soap was so -- if you put on the so ap, you got rashes all over. Who knows what a poison this was? Later when you have to clean up your block, your bed. You have to put in the blankets, and this everything is like under command. Q: Did you have your own bed? A: Bunk. Q: You had your own part, though, or you shared? A: Two, share. Two in one. Q: Were you aware of any resistance at Buchenwald? A: I really don't understand the question. Q: Was there any sort of und erground or sabotage or a nything like that there? A: In Buchenwald -- I want you to listen caref ul. In Buchenwald was a camp who people came from all over the world in this camp. Doctors, lawyers, artists, singers, players, orchestra, symphony players. I spoke with people like Jascha Heifetz. Yo u know, guys like this type. _________, this type people. Ther e was high -- Belgium painters. Not wall painters, paintings. High-class people, this was the concentrate ever ything. And from those people who knows the languages, they select and profession, they send to Theresie nstadt. Why Theresienstadt? Theresienstadt is located in Czechoslovakia. In this area, they speak Czech, Slovakish and Germany. And they have kazzams. You know what a kazzam is? No. Kazz am is they have where they put the Americans over here . They have -- where they concentrate sold iers -- how they call this? My God, I start to be rusty, really. I forgot my vocabular y. Not kazzams. They take, you know -- let's see the National Guard. They concentrate, they got big, you know, for training and everything. For sleeping and ev erything. How they call this? Q: Like what? A military barracks, is this . . . A: Not a military barracks. They don't call a barracks. They're called something else. If I don't find it, I look in the dictionary. I gi ve you the word. So they got in Czechoslovakian Theresienstadt maybe 50 like this, 3,000 people, 4,000 people go in in a barrack like this. And they came from all 19 nationalities. I came -- later when I came to Theresienstadt, I went to a hospital. And I told him, told -- the doctor said he needed an assistant. So I was his assistan t, and people came from all over. And what is my assistant? I give my job what I got. They got a plate, and they put in all kind -- I don't believe it was . . . A: . . . it wasn't any poison or what ever it is. People got diarrhea fr om this, whatever that -- so I was looking out from the window, and the Germans six, seven days befo re liberation, they went stiff and they march. And some people said we never, neve r could start a resistance against them. Never. Because how they loaded. Six days later, all of a sudden, we fr ee. And everybody dance in the street, because Theresienstadt, they planning to make -- the Germans was planning to make oven like in Auschwitz, but they don't got the time to build this. They stop with soldiers. So after liberation on every corner like in the depression y ear, do you remember the American war was, in 1929 in the depression? On every corner they st and -- they give away s oup with the bread, you know, to the people. They got no jobs and everythi ng. This remind me of this. On every corner they're putting soup and bread and food after libera tion. And a little boy, I saw from 12 years, he got a group maybe 800 Germans, they got caught. And he sa id to me -- command, a boy with a stick like a baseball bat and he said to them, "Open your shoes. One shoe wear and one shoe barefoot." So they went with one shoe, and he given the command and every guy who said one word, right away he hit him so badly this little guy, little boy. And I said, "Isn't this not a miracle?" Is a miracle how six days I was looking how they march, and all of a sudden, they dead forever. Later we came, the Americans came this way on ships. The Russians came this way. They kiss each other, embrace each ot her. And they brothers and sisters, and everybody dance in the streets and everything. Becaus e Theresienstadt was a group mostly German Jews, primarily. They concentrate because they speak Ge rmany, and the most intellectual s from all over the world, they sent like from Buchenwald and to Theresienstadt. And this -- after this, we got liberated, till I met my sweetheart. Q: Okay. I want to hear all ab out this, but I got to stop you, because I have a lot of questions. A: Okay. Ask me all questions. 20 Q: Okay. A: I lost th e day anyhow. Q: Right. So you were in Buch enwald a long time, and before liberation about how long do you think you were in Theresienstadt? A: In Theresienstadt? Q: Yeah, before you were liberated? A: In Theresienstadt, I was -- we left Buchenwa ld -- we left Buchenwald in October, November, December. From January to April. Q: Was there a big difference between Theresienstadt and these other camps you had been in? A: Day and night. Q: Tell me. A: Day and night. In Theresiens tadt you could take a shower. Yo u could have a piece bread, you was not hungry. Always hungry, you know, in a case like th is. Everybody who came to Theresienstadt -- my weight was 95 pounds. Original I should ha ve 140, so I was underweight, undernourished. People they came , they start grabbing food fast. They got diarrhea, mostly die from diarrhea. Have no medication to stop this, to do this. And in Theresienstadt, they send all the old clothing. What they steal from all over the world, they sent to Theresienstadt and they put it in storage. Later the people came. One got a shirt, one got a pair of pants. One had this and this and this. And I was looking in Theresienstadt for my godmother, and I . . . Q: But tell me about the life. Wh en you said they had clothes, were you in -- during their time, these four months in Theresienstadt, were you wearing a unifor m? Were you wearing civilian clothes? A: Everybody got grabbed something a piece to wash up. You k now, and show it, and you could wash up, you know. Go and wipe and rinse it u p. You have clean whatever it is. And no work, work was not compulsory. People liked to do some work in the k itchen. People liked to work in bathrooms and bedrooms. People liked to work in cleaning, streets, a million things. Q: What about cultural activ ities or anything like that? 21 A: Culture activities after liberation? Q: No, before liberation. A: Before liberation, th ey didn't even exist. Q: Not in Theresienstadt? A: Not even in Theresienstadt. Q: So there was no extra-curricular stuff? A: Is no such thing in menu, it doesn't exist. Q: Now, you were working for a doctor in the hospital. A: Yes. Q: What were the conditions like ther e? Was that better? Was there actually real medical attention? A: In medical the reason why I went to the hospital, I tried to help my brothers who was in concentration camp. Maybe I can he lp them to recuperate, to live. Any person, what I can help them to live, this give me the most satisfaction. I could help my brothers after what happened and a fire -- after a fire like this. Q: Was there enough -- were ther e supplies and lots of doctors? A: There was not too many doctors. Was not to o many doctors. In my hospital where I work maybe was maybe was five. Later the American came after liberati on, and the Russian came. So we got more culture, you know. More people who try to help those innocent people, what they went through. Q: But before liberation it was a camp, and there wasn't so much medical or anything? A: In Theresienstadt? Q: Yeah. A: No. You could go in free and ask for and they give it to you. This was in Theresienstadt. Q: Did you have a sense that th is camp was highly organized? A: This camp was -- in a way was organized. No body went hungry, that's for sure. Everybody got a bowl of soup. If you want additional, was ready they get the diarrhea. Can I give you something else? 22 Q: Sure. A: When the Russian came -- I sp eak Russian. When the Russian s, came a lady, the Russian women, they, you know, power steer ing. They not like the American women, they carried ten, or whatever that. Came a lady and she was on a horse. She ran a hor se, and she came to me and she stopped me. And she said, "My frien d, ________." "I like to have a pair stocking." And this ______ is an extraordinary, a word what I could not understand. So she came down from the horse, and she lifted up the skirt. So I figured out maybe she like to have love with me, I don't know what's going on. She said, "_______ _____." "I like to have a pair of stockings." And the Russian women, they was crazy about nylons, because they don't even know -- for nyl on, they giving away everything. For a watch and nylons, they was crazy. To make this long story short, this lady said to me "__________?" Do you know what I said? What I said? Q: You tell me. A: She asked me "Do you speak Jewish?" I said, "Yes." She said, "Dei Yiddish?" (ph) I said, "Yes." "Are you Jewish?" I said, "Yes." "And how about you?" She said, "I am Jewish," the lady. When she say "Jewish," and she show me the skir t, "_____________," and I don't know what this mean. Later she said, "_ ________________ nylon stocking," in Jewish. I like that. Nylon socks -- stocking. And I said, "I will try to. Maybe I can organize." End of Tape 2. 23 Tape 3 Q: You were telling me about this Russian woman soldier, and you realized you were both Jewish. A: So I said to her, "I got one dream. Because you're Jewish, maybe you can help me. I need something from you." And she said, "What do you need?" "I like to have a radio. Please bring me a radio. I will do everything for you, whatever you wanted. Please bring me a radio, nothing else." She said -- and I said, "You alone by yourself, or are you in a battalion? You got more Jewish people, whatever there?" She said , "I bring you a group from my battalion, an d a group it is." You know what it was? It was Captai n Majors from the Air Fo rce, Assistant Genera ls -- high-class, and they came. All the Jewish names, and they ta lk because the Russian Jews, they're open-minded people. They are not hidden thing. When they came over as a grou p, I said to her, "I want a radio," so she brought a guy with a radio right away. He brought me a radio, this was my biggest dream, you know, I got a radio. Oh, my God. Okay. So wh at I did to them, I said, "Look, I want you to do something else. This is very important. For all the people who went through in this, bring them something nourishment or something to get back, y ou know, their health, whatever they need." And he said, "Sugar." And this was the biggest trouble. First of all, there was no bags. Everybody who a little jacket, they open up their quarter, he throw it in. He brought a truck with sugar. Everybody put in, they put it in a, you know, a scoop. Five scoops, four scoops, whatev er it is. How much you can take it in, he give it to you. And they have go t a heart like this, those people were so good. And they did everything, and they did everything. Later they brought a group of American soldiers and I spoke with them, and I said to th em, "My dream is to go to Americ a. I want you to do something for me." Captain McGregor, I think he is from Co nnecticut, and I got contact with him. And I said, "My mother has a sister, she live in America. And I want you to help me out, whatever it is." And he said, "I will try." And he try very hard. Later I went to Prague. Prague is the capitol of Czechoslovakia. They call this house horitone (ph), charity. Hor itone, you see, is like charity. For everybody who walk into th is house, I think this was under supe rvision, the Catholic supervision, I think. It was so good. Those nurses, they gi ve away their life. Food and clothing, you name it. They got a policy, everybody who go in and ask, th ey give you a standard policy. They give you 24 $100 American money; $100 , nine meals, two nights, shower, shav e, everything. And after this you are on your own. Some people, th ey like to go to Israel. Some pe ople, they like to go to Sweden. Some people like to go to Switzerland. Some peopl e select the United Stat es of America. And some people, what else there? I think that there is ju st those four select countries. Q: Okay. Let's go back a minute. A: Okay. Q: You're in Theresienstadt. A: Yes. Q: You've been liberated. Were there any Germans still around, or had they all disappeared? A: All the Germans, they put them in camps, arrested as war prisoners. Q: The ones who had been in Theresienstadt? A: War prisoners, and they put them on the site. They was eliminate for all the people in some corner, in some area. An d later the International started about war prisoners. You cannot beat them up, you cannot hit them, you can this. You cannot kill them, you cannot murder th em. You can do nothing. In the beginning before it gets established, you can get even with them. Before is wild, you know. Q: Was that happening? A: Many cases. Q: You saw that? A: Many cases, I saw myself. Q: Other -- you mean other prisoners were beating them up, or the Russian Army? A: No, no, no, no, no, no. Not the Russian Ar my, not the American Army. They kept order, they establish order. For the first five days before they come in was wi ld, until they -- they understand the territory. We tell th em, you know, and get established. Es tablish, you know, they got a -- you know, the governor. They establish a governor who work American governor and the Russian governor altogether, and they establish peace and harmony, whatever it is. And the guy who steal 25 or who rape or a guy -- whatever th e crime was, he got punished for cr ime. There's not such thing. They establish, you kn ow, rules and regulations, whatever they . . . Q: But you're saying before that happened . . . A: In any revolution before gets established peace in this, you got victims. People will get robbed, people get killed. People get even. Q: So the prisoners, you're saying? A: That's right. Whatever it is. Say, like the boy from 12 years, wh at I told you. He got about 800 guys. He give them the business. Later he could do nothing, he could do nothing. Q: How long after liberation did yo u stay at that place about? A: In Theresienstadt? Q: Uh-huh. A: Can I tell you a story? Q: Sure. A: In Theresienstadt . . . Q: About how long? Can you just answer my question? A: How long? Q: A month? A day? A: No. I think about four months. Q: Okay. A: Approximately. Q: Just for the record.

Q: Yeah. I mean didn 't you meet your wife in Theresienstadt? A: Yes. Q: When . . . 26 A: Now, I tell you what happ ened before I met my wife. Q: Okay. A: In Theresienstadt, they call this in Czech, Terezín. Theresiensta dt is in Germany. And the name is made Mother Teresa after they put her in Theresiens tadt. We were with a group, and the group was -- this group was half Jews and half Gentil es. Mixed marriages. She was Jewish, he was a Gentile. She was a Gentile, he was Jewish. Groups like this. Maybe five couples. The one lady who the Nazis beat them up and kill them, and she and her mother and a son, they live in Theresienstadt. Not in the camp. I was at the camp. I considered I met this woman, and she got really a crush on me. She liked to marry me. I -- you know, those days is my mind was all mine, to see my brothers and sisters and maybe some from the family. And who got in health is something in my mind. But she wa s an extraordinary, cultured person. Very educat ed. She was playing the piano and I played the piano. So we was playing the pian o together, she invite me to her mother -- to her mother's house in Theresienstadt. And her mother, she just speak Czechoslovak. In Czech, I am good, I am not so good, but I understand every conversation I could have with her mother. And her mother, she was to me like a mother, honest, the old lady. I am talking about Lena. Anyhow, my friend, he said he was crazy ab out her. And she was a person to be really crazy , believe me, she was a very nice person. And she told me the story about what ha ppened with her husband, Jewish husband. The Nazis came and they know he is Jewish, and they start up with him and they kill him. They take him away, and they got a son, Peter, and Peter camel she came with her son. So I said to her, "You know, Lena," he r name was Lena. So I said to Lena, "If I go to the United States, you go with me. You cannot go without us." And they came to the Un ited States. She ca me to the United States and her son. Her son went into the Air Fo rce, he was in the Air Fo rce. And she was -- she did fashion design, very creative pe rson. And my friend, he die for her, and he married her. When he marry her, the mother, she was in Czechoslovakia. She left her mother. Later she promised by any situation, maybe we take the mo ther over here to the United Stat es. She was in, let's see, about in the '70s. Maybe a little better. And Lena, she visited her mother twice, and came back to the United States. And her mother, she said she will stay in Czechoslov akia, in Theresienstadt. Peter, 27 her son, we was ready to adopt him. He was so nice, as my son. Hone st, what a kid that he was. It was unbelievable. But when I was in Theresienstadt and she told me what the Nazis did to him. So I said, Give me the names. I get even with thos e guys who did to your hu sband." She said, "They got arrested before." Some neighbors, Gentile neig hbors, they pointed out this guy, he was another Hitler, a guy, type like this. And I don't know what, they took him away and I went, "Okay." Later this was Lena, this story. Later I went to the ka zzam, it was a Hungarian kazzam. Hungarians, they have a language like Gypsies. Very yak, yak, yak, yak -- is very, very tough language. I walk in and they told me. I said, "What kind of la nguage you speak over here?" They said, "________________." I said, "They got to be Hungarian." Nobody else. I aske d and they told me they're Hungarian. They all almost naked after liberation. Q: Winter? A: Winter. About 3 or 4,000, these Hunga rians, they all made it fo r this purpose. And like _________, without her, I met fe w women and ask, "Do you have so n at Polish lady by your name, Esther?" She said -- one woman said, "I met a Polish woman over here." "Can you bring the woman over here?" She said, "Yes." Because I could not even go in. My heart was broken how those people after liberation. Few days, few days she brought and this was my godmother. I almost got a heart attack. In those days, they didn't even know what a heart atta ck means. Today I can assure you, I got a heart attack when this happen. And I see my mother, how she look. I said, "What a _______ fighter. Yo u sit over here. I will be back in an hour. I bring you clothing, dresses and everything." So asked Lena in Czechoslovakian , in Theresienstadt in the city who was in the haberdasher stores, who was in th e clothing. Who was this, who wa s this? And she told me this woman, they was in the clothing busi ness. They have dresses, ladies' dresses. Everything is hidden. Everything, you know, after the war, they put us in cellars, in the walls of the building, whatever it is. So I go in, I said, "Lady, I would like to have two, four dresses." She said, "God forbid. My God, ___________. We have nothing. We lost ev erything. We poor peopl e. We got nothing." And she said, "____________." Sh e's a 10 percent Jewish, she told me. Everybody after the war, they start to be Jewish. Everybody was. I said, "Look, I am talking to you nice. You got hidden the 28 dresses. If you don't give me four or five dresse s, I can assure you'll be dead over here in 10 minutes from now. Right now, I wa nt the dresses." She listened -- dead. She said, "Maybe I look, maybe I can find it. Maybe I can lo ok." She goes downstairs in the cellar. Loaded with clothing, boxes with this hidden in this here. She give me five dresses. Then I want underwear. She brought me everything what a woma n need. Panties and these, whatev er it is. And I brought it to my mother, and I said, "Go at." Later I talk with here. "How do you survive? In this age, how you survive?" And she told me, "You know, Dave, what I did? I tell how I surv ive? I took a brick, brick from the house. And take two bricks and make powder and put in a rouge on my face to look 20 years younger. And I make this and I make this." An d she explained to me . I said, "Look, I don't you be over here, not even one minute. Yo u go with me right now." I took her out, and she rest a week. Later she went to th e kitchen to work in the kitchen as a manager. She worked as a supervisor/manager, they don't know manager. S upervise in the kitchen. So she work for a while until we got established, because Lena, the lady, she was a local person. And she knows very well, later they establish rules and regulations, you could not say you kill if you don't give me this. This was in the beginning. Later I expect my brother. My brother, my older brother, he got life. After the liberation, I went to friends, an d they told me is living, he is in Morocco. When he came back and I left him, a sign, yo ur brother we never knew each other almost. I was a little kid, and he was the older brother. So he say he came to me. Later we went to La ndsberg am Lech, we all the group let them go to hell. We will stay over here. Th e whole thing is w ith blood, with tears, whatever they -- so we went to Landsberg am Lech where Hitler wrote his Mein Kampf, the book. Are you familiar with this? You know what I'm talking? He wrote Mein Kampf, the book, Hitler. In Landsberg am Lech, I went to the chaplain in Germ any, and I said, "Chaplai n, I would like to have a place to live. I got my mother over here. I go t my mother's daughter, my godmother's daughter with me. I got Lena, I got a bu nch, a group with names and ever ything." So he give me two bedrooms and a kitchen and a house and maybe 25 feet -- maybe 50 f eet where they put old Goering, Goebbels, all those to death. They got shot in Landsberg am Lech. Where they took the group and they kill them, and we was almost see how they did to them. 29 Q: But the house you were liv ing in is near that; is that what you're saying? A: Excuse me? Q: The house you were living in was near that; is that what you're telling me? A: The house we live in in Land sberg am Lech, all this -- you know , in the Bible, in the Bible is written Abraham's house was a house for the hungry, for the na ked, for the poor. Everybody who go in in Abraham's house, he got a meal and cl othing and dress and ever ything. Our house was Abraham's house. Everybody came, we feed them, we dress them . We do everything what we can do. This was in Landsberg am Lech. Landsberg am Lech, I'll give you the translation. Landsberg is the city, the name. Landsberg. On the Elbe, on the lake. So when I was af ter the liberation, I just butt in right now into something else. After libera tion I was looking for my fa mily in Germany. In Germany I could not find them, nobody. So I we nt to France, because I knew my family live in France. So my brother was in a ca mp -- my two brothers were in ca mp. My sister was in camp, the younger sister. And after the liberation, she di ed, and those two brothers, they survived. My brother, the older brother, he was a doctor. And the other brother, he was in the financing business as far as I remember in mind what is. So I left a note with a guy, so I came to France in the name Metz, M-e-t-z in Ludwigshafen. This is between the German border and the French borders. I came, I took a trip, was a long trip. Maybe 24 hours, and I go in and was a guy, a shoe shine man who, you know, who shines shoes. In the street, they got a stand. And he block hats, he finish up hats. In Europe, they use hats, men. So I go up to the guy a nd I said, "Monsieur, ______________?" He sa id, "You can speak to me German, because your French is broken." I said, "I get by with my Fr ench. I just start up w ith you. Do you know a family in Metz, Morris Davidovicz?" He said, "Morris Davi dovicz, they were richest people in the Metz." My brother -- which is true. He know my brother, all the brothers and the sisters, this guy. They always took shoe shines with the guys. They know everything, you know, those guys. So I was not successful. I said, "Do you me a favor. I gi ve you my name and ad dress and telephone in Germany where I was located, where I am now. I am in Landsberg am Lech. If they re turn, with God's will, I want you to tell them to come. I do everything for them. I pay them everything what they wanted in this." He 30 came. When he came back about, let's see, about six weeks later, my brother came to my godmother's house. And they ca me and everybody, we was in La ndsberg. There was about maybe 4,000 Jews, a Jewish camp, a free camp. Like bungalows, they go t bungalows, they have mobile homes. You know, people live privat e. No more on the Nazis', you k now, stuff free. And they said to me, "Dave, your brother's over here from Fran ce." I said, "You're craz y. What?" And we was on the second floor, a two-story building. I don't kno w how I went. I think I fly, how I came down. I don't remember I walk with the steps, so anxious I was to see my brother. I look on my brother, he look like my mother. One piece, I don't him. I really don't know him. I really don't know him. Maybe I was maybe four years old. How can I recognize a person so many years? I said, "Morris, what language you speak?" He sa id, "Three languages. I speak Fr ench, I speak Jewish and I speak Germany." And I start talking to him, and he sa id to me, "Who survived from the mishpocha, from the family?" Mishpocha is in Hebrew. "Who survive from the family?" He said, "Me and Gustav." "What happened my sisters, Bella , Frencha, Freda? What happen ed with them?" At the last minute, the Nazis, they send them to a concentration camp . They never show up back. We cry with this and this. So he said to me, "Dave, I want you do for me one thing. One thing. I need a pair of glasses. I cannot see. I'm looking on the look. I lost my vision and everything." I said, "I give you a pair of glasses." I went to people who tipped me off who was the optometrist, whatever it is, in the eyeglasses' business. They have the Germans. They don't have nothing, no thing. They cry we have nothing. I said, "Look, don't you go out and te ll me you don't have nothi ng. I know you got in cellar, and you better give it to me right away." And I went down and the guy came, and he give. He went and when he put on the glasses, he said, "God, you bri ng me new eyes. I never forget you." Q: I'll tell you when. You wanted to . . . A: I apologize to you in this story about Theresiens tadt, I left out a very important romance with my wife. I walk in Theresienstadt myself, and I wa s thinking about my futu re. How to organize my own life, and what will be the next step? I saw a lady standing in a spot where they supply clothing to the poor people and to average people, whatever it is. So I said to her, "Can you tell me, lady, 31 what time is now?" And she said to me, she give me about 10 o'cloc k, whatever, 11 o'clock. I said, "You look so familiar to me." An d she said, "Yes, do we know each other?" She said, "Can you tell me your name?" And she said, "I came from Lódz." Lódz is a c ity in Poland. "My father was a textile engineer by the name _______ __________." In Polish __________ ___________. Translate in English Brauder Shag ossi (ph). After she told me the name, I said, "You know, this name sound to me so in my ears, I think I know so mebody in your family." She said, "Maybe." "Do you have somebody, a cousin or somebody, an uncle by the na me Shagossi, who make special material for special raincoats -- a special material for raincoats?" She said, "Yes." From here we start up a conversation, and we ta lk and later we talk about movies and this and a million things until we get acquainted. And I got really -- how you say -- a crunch? A crush on her. And we start dating. After we start dating and she told me what kind education she has, what school you in. And I told her my education, what we did and everything. She said she's going to Landsberg am Lech. I said, "So am I." "Why you going to Landsberg am Lech?" to her. She said, "I'm looking for my brother. I got the only brother, an d I was told he is in Landsberg am Lech." Now, I went straight out for you, maybe you don't know this. After liberation, Germany was divided in four zoning: American zone, English zone, Fr ench zone and Russian zone. She live later -- she was on the English zone and I live on the American zone. Q: Later? A: Later. Q: Okay. A: And this was a distance approximately 1,800 miles. Q: Okay. But first, did you go to Landsberg together first? A: Excuse me? Q: Did the two of you go to Landsberg together first? A: First, we went to La ndsberg. From Landsberg, she was on the American side with me. We lived separate, we didn't live together. This against my principle, against my re ligions to live with a person if I'm not married. So the lady, she says , "You know, Dave, with a ll respect to you, I like 32 you very much, and are we very se rious both. But I am looking for my brother. This is the only brother, and I was told he is alive." So her brot her was on the English side, they call this Hannover, the city in Germany. Hannover. From Hannover, he went to Bergen-Bel sen, the big camp in Bergen-Belsen. So she found her brother. When she fo und her brother, and I was lonely myself and I was very anxious to meet he r. I think she run away from me approximately was maybe seven weeks, maybe two months we got separate. Separate d each other. So we was very grateful, thank God she got her brother, and later I went to visit her. I got a camera with me, they stole that camera on the trip what I made because this is between 1,700 or 1,800 miles. When you came from one zoning to the other one, you have to have docume nt. So they came to me, a German and an Englishman soldier, MP, Military Police. And they said, "________." I said, "I got down here I can give you marriage license to show y ou. I don't have a passport." And they was not very strict. I spoke with the guy, I got a girl and we love each other, this. I would like to meet her, and she's in the English zone. And I told them about the brothe r, the whole story. He said, "Go ahead." And I visit with her, the France is -- during the time she start organize a school, a sewing school, under the label ORT, Organization Through Rehabilitation. This the name ORT in short. So let me explain to you about his school. This is very . . . Q: Actually, I want to stop you a moment because we're going to interview your wife, and she should tell me about the school. I want you to tell me about your work in Landsberg. A: In Landsberg? Q: Yeah, because she can tell about her . . . A: Okay. Later we meet in Be rgen-Belsen, and later she came on the American side. And we planning to get married, okay, and this was final. Now, you aske d me what I did in Landsberg am Lech. I went and work for the UNRA, United Rehabilitation Through Training. I registered people, people who got the money to travel to looking for families. People looking what they lost in the Second War, what they go, how to give them direction, what they do, what they go and how they can find help. But this was my job to advise them. You have to go over here, this is located in Poland. This is far from here, because all those kids after the war who survive, when they took 33 them was six years old. After li beration was 10, 11, 12, 15, the mo st. Those kids, they never got education. They don't ev en know the alphabet -- the alphabet . We teach them. We give them lectures to make them useful for the society. Q: That was also part of your job? A: My job, and plus with a group to organize this particular profession for those kids. Later we teach them to read, to write and to do something. Later they select te rritories where they like to live, so we prepared them for immigrat ion. Some, they select Switzerland. Some, they select Sweden. Some, they select the United States . And some, they select Israel. Those four countries they select. And we make them useful the soci ety to grow up and to send them to know something about the whole world. Later I organize for handicap, invalids. Everybody gets a docum ent, is an invalid. We send them to doctors to classify the percenta ge, how much they lost life and for his handicap percentage, how many. Some, they got 25 percent. Some, they got 100 percent. Some, they got 75 percent. This established, the doctors they give them a percentage. After this, we give them a document, is an invalid, a handicap. In what camp he was, how long he was, what he did in camp and this, the whole histor y. And this was my job. Q: Sounds like you had a lot of different responsibilities. A: Obligations and responsibilities, not what somebody told me, myself. And I ne ver got paid one nickel, not from UNRA, not from the American Rehabilitation Center, not from the invalid, from the handicap. Everything was myself, how do you call this? Q: Volunteer. A: Volunteer work. And later we established ourself and I made up my mind to marry my sweetheart. Q: In Landsberg . . . A: In Landsberg. Q: . . . was there much of an organizati on? I mean was UNRA pretty organized? A: No, I give you biography about in Landsberg, wh at was. Landsberg was not a camp. Landsberg was a barracks, free, you can sleep till 10 o'clock, to 11 o'clock. You did not ha ve to wake up in the 34 morning. You go bathing. You ca n take showers. You can go to the dentist. You can go to a doctor. You can go -- you ca n travel in any direction. If you don't have cash or money, UNRA give you a certain amount money for lo oking for your family for your __________, whatever it is. You very free and very flexible. Yo u can go in any direction where yo u wanted. This was Landsberg am Lech. And temporary we live in barracks. Everybody got a bed, a room, three girls in a room. Three boys in a room. No men -- very strict -- no men could go in in a girl's room without the girl's permission. And if he did this, he's eliminated from Landsberg. Q: There was a court system? A: This is a system. Has to be, we very strictly ab out principles and morals. Q: After all of this war? A: Everything. Just was very -- of course, we consult our chaplain, American chaplains. They took care, and with rabbis. I marry r itual according to script ures, according to Bibl e, and so somebody else. My rabbi, who give me my two advice. One was from Hungary, Hungarian; and one was from Poland. The guy from Poland, he went to Yeshiva, to -- Yeshiva is Hebrew school. He went with me in the same class. He l earned to be a rabbi, and I don't. Q: Was there a camp administratio n of the people who lived there? A: UNRA and officers, they got -- most responsible was for training, rehabilitation, for looking for families, for travel, fi nancial support. For a while, he can go; when he came back, he has to register again and prove it, he left for a month, two mont hs, whatever it is. If he like to remain in Landsberg, he could. Even he left for two or three months. Q: But what I'm wondering is, was there eventu ally a camp administra tion set up, a Jewish administration? A: A mix. A mix. Landsberg got Jewish and non-Jewish people. We was interesting, we never classified Jewish or not Jewish. People, th ey are people. What I need when I was in Czechoslovakia, I went to Horitone, to charity; they are Catholic. When I told them I am Jewish, they don't ask me, "Are you Jewi sh, or we don't support you?" Q: So everybody in Landsberg got along? 35 A: Very long. First of all, we got culture. We got recreation. We got amateur sh ows. We got dancing. We got singing. We got a choir. We got entertainment. All those, everything, all those culture things was preparation to go out from Lands berg. And during the time, not to get rusty. This what we miss, so we got groups camping -- we got everything. Some people like camping. Some people like to go for a concert. I was si nging myself in the choir, so was my wife. Q: So -- but you're saying that in Landsberg there were Jewish people and non-Jewish . . . A: Right. Q: . . . and everybody got along? A: Right. Is no such th ing, is no such thing. No complaints. I don't remember we got our own police. Not police, people who watched the, you know, law and orde r. We never got complaints. Raping or shooting or stea ling. As far as I'm con cerned, I never remember. Q: What, in your opinion, were the biggest challenges at that time, your biggest concerns? A: The biggest dream, not only my dream, all th e people who live -- I can say all the people in Landsberg, everybody knows David Davis. They know it, and Fr ancis Davis, because we was active eight hours a day, maybe 10 hours a day. When everybody went home, we still thinking about my brothers and sisters. Q: So what was the hardest thing for you to accomplish? A: The biggest dream was our dream was to get out from Landsberg and find direction what you needed, and to be accepted in society like a human being like everybody else. This one dream. The second dream is to go to the United States of America and to live under democracy and culture, and to have benefits and everything like everybody else. Like everybody else. Q: Was it difficult to start over and reach these dreams? A: Was very hard. I like to make a statement. Ma ybe is not proper, but corre ct me if I am wrong. The people in the United States who was born over here, they do not apprecia te this country like we people who came to the United States, how we a ppreciate this country. Because they brought up like this, they remember, you know, their grandparents, father, mother, whatever it is, what they did. They came from the other si de. When we came over here, we ki ssed the earth. God bless America. 36 This is the second. The th ird dream was to start to go to school. She went, my wife went to college. She pick up in Europe, you can go in college if you don't pick up a second language. You have to know two languages. So she pick up English; for her, it was easy. When I came over here, my vocabulary was maybe 100 word s English. So we went -- I went to the high school in Brooklyn, high school education for adults. I got beautiful teachers, gorg eous. God bless th em. What they did for me, those guys. I remember he said, "This is a pencil. Repeat this is a penc il." Right away, how to write pencil. They was very good to us, to me, to everybody. The first step, they said, stay away from foreign languages newspapers, magazi nes. Start reading American magazines and American newspapers. I don't say -- they said - the principal, I don't say you should abolish or liquidate the language what you know, whatever it is. If you w ill learn quick and nice and good English, you have to do this way. If you read it, rain, shine, snow - we went to school. She went to college, and I went to the high school. Q: What year did you co me to the United States? A: In 19- -- beginning '49. Q: Was it difficult to get a Visa? A: Not for me. Because I put in affidavit, I put in an affidavit. I w ill not collect relief. I go to work. I will not take from the government nothing. I don't want support from th e government. I will support myself. My money, what I brought to the United States $50. That I bought for my little baby, God bless her, my daughter, a carri age for $40, and I got $10 in my pocket. Q: So you had a baby at Landsberg? A: Yes. Q: Now, just a couple more ques tions. Throughout all of this pe riod of time, was religion important to you at all? A: Religious -- I am a religious person, and I believe in the Ten Commandmen ts. You don't have to read the five book of Moses. Y ou don't have to read -- because so me people, they think if they know about the five book of Moses, they got the Bi ble and they are religious . They go to church, the synagogue -- wrong from the be ginning. In the Jewish tradition, we got more than hundreds of 37 books with commentaries about th e religious. My religion is the Ten Commandments. If you obey the Ten Commandments, you 're the most ethical pe rson on the globe. Q: So this is what carried you through, or . . . A: This kept my faith, my Jewishness and my religious, th e Ten Commandments. Q: You mentioned a few th ings that when you came over here, you had to work, you had to learn English. Was it diff icult to start over? A: Very hard. But, you see, my languages -- my languages, what I possess, the high-fidelity English, if they speak, I can understand. Q: But in what other ways was it difficult? A: Difficulties a job. You have to realize I work for 50 cents an hour. Not because they took advantage of me, because I was a re fugee or I was a foreigner. N o, no, no, no, no. I deserve 50 cents an hour because what I did, the 50 cents an hour was to get acquainted with work, the system what they had. I did things what I never did. I polished pencils. I start with 50 cents an hour. Later the boss -- after three months, he want me to make manager. Because thos e guys, they make five dozens; I make 10 dozens. They ma ke five dozens; I make 15 dozens, what I did. So right away, I got guts to go into the boss. I said, "I cannot work for 50 cents an hour. I got a little baby, and I got a wife." He said, "I give you 75 ." And he start up, you know, the guy speak Jewish, was a Jewish foreman. And he said, "The greenhorn," I don't want to say what he said. Something else. "The greenhorn. He just came. He like to have righ t away a lot of money." I said, "Look, I need money because," in Jewish because I could have a conver sation with the guy. And I told him. Two weeks later, I want a dollar, because I know I deserve. He said, "It's too bad. If you cannot make by this." They like to make me foreman. They offer me $5 an hour in this place. Can you imagine this? In eight months. I accept. Later I look for a different job. Culture job, job what I know best. I was in printing lithography and four-color separation. War is the biggest criminal for people who make the war. They should be punished b ecause they provoke and they organize the wars , is the number one. After this what happ ened in Hitler's time, afte r 50 years, no improvemen t. We got the Ku Klux Klan. We got militias. They kill senators, congressmen, policeman, everybody. Is no law and 38 order and they don't get what they deserve. We have to bring America to culture, to rehabilitate those criminals to make them peop le. All the jails, they full with criminals wi th raping, no respect for women, no respect for kids. Women classified as second citizen s. They never was in the history in a country, what they do. And this has to be stopped once forever. We don't want no more concentration camps. We don't -- we have to go to basic to bring America -- and history, if they bring America to this tradition what America is supposed to be, there will be no more concentration camp. The history will recognize American - what America supposed to be and what our Constitution said what the citizen, every citizen, should benefit from Am erica because everybody deserve the same thing.
