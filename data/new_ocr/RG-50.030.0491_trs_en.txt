A: Yeah, register is, because I -- when I was t -- I w-w-was as a young man very pessimistic, because I wanted to go out, because my father wouldn™t allo w it, because he registered myself as the whole family. But of course -- and I ri -- entered the -- the Hehalutz movement , and I went -- and -- t-to work in a village, because they have ran out -- th-t here were not -- is enough working places for young people, because all young people registered with Hehalutz because the -- I th -- think it was fi -- till 25, till 26 years of age.

A: Well, the climate -- all people who wanted to st udy, co-could study at university, because we had as [indecipherable] A2: It™s matriculation. A: Yes, yes, because I want to study, I want to -- to the medical school, and we were there, and it -- the students were also fascists, ver-very -- very -- as a g-group, the students were fascists, because they -- they were unfriendly relations to the Jews, becau se [indecipherable] maked demonstrations against Jews, right? Q: Was there a quota system for Jews? A: No, no, no, no, no. Q: So Jews could get into the -- A: Yes, yes, yes. Q: Not a -- not a problem? A: Not, not a problem.

Because the -- the teacher, and -- of anatomy was a fascist, but she -- we didn™t feel any -- 13 A2: Discrimination? A: What? A2: Discrimination? A: Yes. Because it -- in -- in -- in exams there we re hundred percent all right, because -- because there was one teacher was -- there were no Jews, not [indeci pherable] because the Jewish professors went to the German™s university. Because Brno was a -- a -- was divided between -- between Czechs and Germans, because one teacher of embuology -- A2: Embryology. A: Embryology, once made the statement, ﬁIf you don™ t like Jews, you can go to hell.ﬂ Because there were s -- w-was demonstrations against Jews. Q: There were demonstrations? A: Yes, yes.

Q: So did they put up posters? A: Yes, yes. Q: Is that how you knew? A: No, no, no. Because a -- they ca -- got up and shouted at Jedei ren -- A2: Jews away. A: Jews away. Because that professor told the Jews -- the non-Jews, to go away from the lectures. He will -- he lectures only to the Jews, because that is not serious, but beca use the -- if you continue [indecipherable] this, this was pleasant. Q: What year was this that the demonstrations started? A: Because y -- y -- th-that was in the -- in the -- in that year that the [indecipherable] that German was -- A2: Annexed.

A: No, only iv -- I don™t remember, no -- th -- not demonstrations, no. Public, no. Q: No? A: No. In our city, that were no demonstrations.

Q: By -- by your own volition, or -- A: I wa -- wa -- because in the pra -- six months pr ior to the occupations, I was expelled of -- of -- as the school because I was born in -- in Drogobych, becau se I -- I -- I could -- I could -- I could go on because it™s -- it™s -- recognize that I was not a foreigner, because I was only born in Poland, because I was a Czech, and my father w-was a -- a state professor in -- in high school, because they -- they let me study. [indecipherable] I didn™t want to, because I thought that this was no use. 16 Q: You thought it was no use to keep studying? A: Ye -- yes, because I wa -- wa -- I was always a pessimist, I thought Hitler, and I -- it -- and I knew what was coming. Q: So you were expelled? A: No, no, becau -- I didn™t regis -- register myself anew. Q: You didn™t register yourself? A: Yes. Q: And tell me about that. A: Why? Q: What -- y-y-you were supposed to register all over again?

Q: Okay, there™s a difference. A: Yes. Q: Okay. A: [indecipherable] because my fr iend was born in Romania because he applied against this expulsion, and he was -- he was re-admitted in s -- in -- at the re -- university. Q: Okay, now you -- you say you were always a pessimist. A: Yes. Q: And then when -- when Hitler came to power you said, what™s the use. A: Well, yes. Q: Okay. So how -- when did you become aware of -- of Hitler and -- and of the pessimistic possibilities? A: Because I listened to what was going on the Germany, and ga -- annexed Austria and I was convinced that Czechoslovakia would be the next one. Q: Did your father think so too? A: Yes, he thought so too, because he never spok e about it, because he was a pupil -- a -- a -- got a German pupil, yeah, because in the la st -- in the last few years, he was teaching at the German school, because the -- the Czech -- the Jewi sh school was all Czech, because th -- because -- and one of the pupils sued him, because he -- he -- he got wa -- Q: Did you just say one of the pupils shot him? A: No, no, shoo -- sued -- Q: Sued him. 18 A: Sued, sued. Q: One of the pupils sued him, okay.

Q: When you felt these premonitions, when -- wh en Hitler started annexing around you and came to power, how did that affect your father™s political activities, do you remember? A: Yes, because he wrote to his -- to his relatives in America, and -- a nd asked them to get a -- a -- get us out, because it -- it™s just not possible, because then he tried England, and it was there not possible, also. But he tried, because -- he didn™t succeed. Q: So how did this affect your -- your family life th en? What happened with -- to the -- to your family, what happened to other Jews there? A: Well, I was out of the family, I was a -- a -- in a [indecipherable] because -- what is it? A2: They worked on farms. 19 Q: Okay, so this is -- so you -- okay, I™m -- we™re ge tting a -- I™m getting a li ttle confused, okay. Were -- we -- last I left off with you I think we were in ™36? A: No. Q: ™38? A: ™39. Q: No, no, no, ™39 is too late. ™39 all sorts of stuff happened. A: Becau -- I -- I -- this -- what happened in the court was after ™39. Q: Okay.

Q: You know what I mean, just from what you™ ve sent me, you™ve done a lot of things. A: Yeah. Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that™s just a tiny bit. Okay, so you drop out of medical school. A: Yeah. Q: What did you do then? What did you do with your life? A: Nothing. Becau -- I™ve started to go to the coffee house, because -- yes, I got the -- a -- a few pprivate p-pupils one. A2: What did you teach? 20 Q: Just -- I have to ask you -- A2: I don™t even know that. Q: Okay, but -- A2: I™m sorry, this is all new to me, I™m sorry. A: What I tut -- Latin. Yes.

At what point was your life as a -- as a Jew determined by being Jewish, so that whatever freedoms you may have had, say to go to me dical school as a Jew, at some point, those freedoms were removed. A: Yes. Q: At what point was that, and what do you remember about that? A: Well, we were -- the Jews were victims alread -- already in ™39, because all the -- the laws were -- were -- were -- the Jews were submitted to laws, because the Germans took the -- took -- I -- I don™t ger -- Germans -- what -- Q: Well, they en -- they enacted a number of very severe laws. A: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Because that is why I went from the family to the -- to -- to the [indecipherable] because they wanted to prepare the Jews for emigration.

Q: What did other people think at the time, when a ll of the laws came down against Jews, what -- did people think this was just a fluke, temporary, go away -- A: Yeah, yes -- no. Because th -- th-the -- they would -- they went along with the restrictions because they -- they couldn™t imagine that they would come down to this, because the majority of the Jews didn™t think of that. Q: Were -- were Jews required to live in specific locations at this point? A: No, no.

A: Yes. Once -- one pupil. Q: I take it you didn™t do that for long. A: No, because the Germans came, I -- I was with Hehalutz. Q: Okay, so tell me about getting with Hehalutz. Why did you decide to do that? 24 A: What -- what all young Jews did at that time, because I™ve register with Hehalutz and they -- they accepted me. Q: Were there both youn g men and young women? A: Yes. Q: A-And they accepted you to do what? A: To wait. Because they h-had to orda -- the -- the organizations was trying to find workplaces, because which it -- and everysi -- workplace they find, they took -- they took Jews, because as -- as a matter of fact, the -- this is -- this was easy, b ecause the -- the -- the -- the germ -- Germans took Slovakia as a separate entity, and the -- in -- in harvest time, there we re no Slovak workers who used to come for the harvest, because that -- the -- that gave the Jews opportunity to -- to send their own people. Q: To do what? A: To -- instead of the Slovak, who didn™t come any more because they were a separate entity, and the -- the places that the Slovaks wo rked in were freed, because -- Q: And they needed young people to work? A: Yes, yes, yes. Q: Okay. So did you go -- did you leave home then, to work? A: Yes, yes, yes. Q: Where -- where did you go, what did you do? A: I went to a -- a individual Hashorah, because th ey were not -- not a group, because there were three people in the village. And Mikelorwitsa. And all worked with different farmer. Q: Did you have any training in farm work before this? A: No, no, no, no. W-We -- we qu -- considered as students. Q: So what -- what did you do on the farm? 25 A: Everything. Ev-Everything. Fir -- first it is the harvest time, we wo rked in the field, and my -- my boss, he loved me. And as a matter of fact, as a -- a -- a shadchan, you know? A [indecipherable] woman who -- A2: Matchmaker. A: Ma-Matchmaker came one day to me and said ho -- I want to arrange this -- the marriage between you and that daughter of the -- of the farmer. Because -- I said I can™t do that, because Jews are not li -- not allowed. No, you™ve -- you work, you are not a Jew. Q: You work and you™re en -- so you™re not a Jew? A: Yes. Q: What did that mean when she said you -- A: Because h-he didn™t consider the Jews who worked in the fields, becau se he -- there™s pa -- they™re - had -- in their psychology, work -- people who work, they are not Jews. Q: So he assumed Jews were slackers? A: What? Q: He thought Jews were slackers? A: Yes, beca -- Jews were rich. Q: Jews were rich? A: Yes. Q: Oh, okay. So do y -- do you think you changed hearts and minds? A: No. Q: No, it sounds like you did. A: Because the m-mayor of the village was a fascist, because he -- he was the brother of a general -- of a Czech general who fled to England, and he thought that™s who he -- he would be well thought of if you -- you join those fascists, because the -- this -- because a -- a -- a number of farmers went to 26 demonstrated a -- a -- against the -- Kukarussia was his name, because i-if he was anti-Semite, they didn™t want it, because th-thr ee Jews are c -- all right. Q: So what was the town you were in? Where -- where was this farm? A: What? Q: Where was the farm? A: In -- not -- in Bohemia, but i-i-it was close to the -- ma -- ma -- to my -- to my hometown. Q: Did you si -- live on the farm? A: Yes, yes, yes. Q: Were there other peop le with you, other Jews? A: Yes. Di -- no, we lived in the -- i-in a house w-w-which was empty, but it was meant for the poor -- for the poor of the village. And one poor -- one th -- one man was leavi ng to two, not in ours -- in our -- in our room, because we were three. Q: Okay, three -- three of you, and one of you the prospective fiancé of the farmer™s daughter. A: Yes. Q: So what -- now -- A: We w -- met her after -- we met her to the sk -- communist Zion in -- in Mikelorwitsa, and she cried. Q: So di -- was the farmer™s daughter interested in you? A: Yes, yes. Q: So you had a little romance? A: No, no, no. Q: So di -- so how did y -- what -- what happened after -- after this, when the -- you were a -- a -- you were approached to marry the daughter, and you said no, I can™t, cause I™m Jewish. Th-The matchmaker says it doesn™t matter. 27 A: Yes. Q: Then what? A: Because -- fr -- shortly after that, we were -- I was caught proo -- proo -- Prague, the -- the headquarters of the Hehalutz, because they -- they thought that the mayor was n -- was not in favor of us. Q: So you were moved to Prague? A: Yes. Q: Oh. Then what happened? A: Then I was two -- two or three weeks in the course -- course, and afterwards the Hehalutz movement, the leadership was in -- they felt that is -- there™s war, of course, coming, and they left. Q: Left Prague? A: Yes, to Israel -- to Palestine. Q: So they emigrated. The leadership. A: Yes, yes, yes. Because they have the certificates. Q: What certificates? Of emigration? A: Yes, yes. No, of acceptance in Palestine by the British mandatory government. Q: Did you think of going? A: Yes, yes, I thought of it, but I was not -- I t hought I could have gone, actually, but then I thought that my fate was th -- with the Hehalutz movement, because I refused to go, yes. Q: Why? A: I w-wanted to be with that group. Q: With the Hehalutz? A: Yes. With this group that I was working. Q: What did you think you could do by staying? 28 A: Well, not much. Because it is a fa ct that a -- if you refuse to go -- because my father a-a-arranged for me to get a cerfic -- tuf -- Q: Certificate. A: -- certificate as a student to Jerusalem, bec -- that I won™t go, because I was now a proletarian. Yes, sh -- th-that was stupid. Q: So the -- and what name we re you using now, at this point? A: Yeah -- Q: Still the name th at you were born with? A: No, Moshe le -- Lemberger. Q: Okay, but it wasn™t Moshe, right, it was -- A: No, the movement called me Moshe. Q: Okay, well ha -- the movement called you Moshe? A: Yes. Q: Was that your c hoice or theirs? A: No, my choice. Q: Why? A: Because tha -- this was my middle name. Q: But why give up your first name for your middle name? A: I didn™t give up, because I was Arnosht -- Erns t Lemberger on -- on the official papers, but among ourself they called me Moshe. Q: How did that start? A: Everybody used her middle name. Q: Okay. Was that to be more jew -- more bonded in your Jewishness? 29 A: Yes, yes, yes. Because I was afterwards col -- I became a member of the Hehalutz leadership, because they -- they -- they frunthe -- function of this left because they took every Zionist movement, but took -- they made you hanhalla. A2: Directorship. A: Yu -- ri -- directorship. I was one of them, except I was never a re gis -- registered stylist, because they took me -- I-I was o-on a Jewish school, and my father was a -- a -- was a Zionist because they took me in. Q: What in you -- I mean, given -- I mean your father was a Zionist, you weren™t. You weren™t related -- raised in a very religious household. A: No. Q: What happened in you to make you wa nt to be a leader in that movement? A: Well, they asked me, because I was a -- a Zion ist always, always, because that was the good move for me, I thought, because I was immediately the -- the -- they made me director of the bake -- Beit Hehalutz, because th-that™s was a ho-home fo r workers, because th -- the -- I go -- Q: Want a break? A: Yes. Q: Okay. [tape break] Okay, so we™re on you™ve become the leader. A: I was the rev -- dov -- rest -- director of the Beit Karlotseim becau se this is h-h-ha -- hostile for Karlotseim, you -- who did find work, because -- and they were waiting for certificates, and all means of illegal transport sessions to Palestine. Not -- not one of them went. Q: Okay, hang on, there™s something now funky w ith the microphone. Okay, they were waiting but none of them went? A: Yes. Q: Why not? 30 A: But -- because I found out that the ce-ce-certificate of going to Palestine were sold to Jews for money, because -- including non-Zionists. Q: Who sold them? A: That Palestine office, because i-i -- the head of the chi -- pi -- tels -- Palestine office w-was Mr. Jakov Edelstein. He s-sold them. But -- Q: So Jews were exploiting other Jews? A: Yes, because they -- they needed the money, because w-why give ce rtificates to -- to poor people, proletarian, if they can get a lot of money for this -- for this certifi -- certificates. Q: So you were stuck with a bunch of proletariat? A: Yes. I believed in that, because we -- we went -- w-we wanted to go to dol -- the real kibbutzim in Israel, and that was proletarian culture. Q: But you couldn™t if you didn™t have a certificate. A: Yes, because we waited. Q: So what did you do? A: Well, I got disappointed very ear ly, and that -- and then I -- I -- at the beginning, I published two pa-papers called Allez Immigrants, because up to then I was told I could not publish it because this allsbare illegal pub -- publications, that the Jewish community did not allow that. But that was a disappointment, but I c-continued my work. But then I -- I published later, I don™t know the date, a -- a -- a -- that™s was all -- oh yeah th-that -- then I -- th ere™s -- took this Beit Karlotseim and turned it into a social affairs -- Q: Committee? A: Yes -- no. Q: Organization? 31 A: Yes, because -- and I organized a group of members of the Beit Karlot seim to protest against this -- against -- I can™t sa -- Q: Against the change, you mean? A: Yeah. Q: Okay, so help me understand. So he re you™re th-the -- the leader, right? A: Yes, yes. Q: Of the young Zionist organization, of the Hehalutz. A: Yes. Q: You pissed off the people in Prague, right? They™re mad at you, the other Jews? A: Yes. Q: So they say, okay, you can™t do that any more, now you™re a social organization? A2: No. A: Yeah. What? Q: No? A2: They wanted to declare them as social cases. A: No, no, no, no. A2: Well, see, that™s what you wrote in the paper. A: Because the -- there has -- the be -- Je wish community had a social department. Q: Mm-hm. A: And that -- there was a number of organizations, social -- social organizations, Beit Karlotseim was separate because there was a sepa rate o-organization, not -- not -- Q: Okay. 32 A: And the -- the organiz -- the social services department turned th e Beit Karlotseim into a social organization. And this I acs -- saw it, but this was a move to young people to prepare the transportations w-when -- if c-comes. Q: Really? A: Yes. Q: You s -- okay, I™m sorry. A: And organized the young people of -- who lived in the Beit Karlotseim, to -- they must [indecipherable] against this move. And they didn™t appreciate it at all. Q: So the young people didn™t go along with you? A: No -- yes, is -- Q: They did. A: They didn™t go -- because the head of the social bi -- department, Dr. Katz didn™t even talk to them. Q: So the so-called adults -- A: Yes. Q: -- just made a decision that you felt put the youth in peril? A: Yes. Q: And you fought against that? A: Yes, yes. Q: And you got all the youth to go along with you? A: Yes. Because then I was a -- then I was a -- a -- I was no longer head of the hek -- Beit Karlotseim, because I was sus -- suspect, because I said -- and that was actually what happened. The young people were sent to a -- a -- a -- a -- a camp in -- in Bohemia to -- to prepare th e -- the -- the future ghetto in Terezín, because that time, Jewish community got the idea that -- that Te rezín is the future of the Jews, a-and why at that time already two transportations went to -- to Lódz, because -- and that™s -- the 33 Jewish community -- I™d believe so, they -- they -- they believed that was at -- a -- a solution for the Jewish problem in -- in ber -- bets -- ter -- te -- ter -- [indecipherable ] Berman and Melber -- Bohemia and Moravia, because they would save the Czech Jews from being sent abroad to -- if -- ist -- it™s proved to be death camp. But they a -- the Jewish community believed in that. I didn™t. And -- and th-the youth repaired th -- Terezín as the ghetto. They were -- th-they we re -- we -- s -- were strong. And youth, be -- I -- and young people, and dup -- keek -- they did prepare it. And when the ghetto came into being, I -- the -- the -- I can™t. I can™t. Q: When -- when the ghetto came into being, did you feel vindicated in any way? Did you feel like, look, I -- I pointed this out to you, that this was a problem here? A: Yes, yes, yes, yes. And how in -- how long -- A2: The directorship. A: The directorship of the ghetto was almost hundred percent Zionist, because that was Jankov Edelstein™s work, because he -- he believed in that, I think. Q: And where was the rest of your family during th is time? Where was your mother, and father, and sister? A: Fa -- Father was dead, and Mother -- and the sister lived i-in pa -- sw -- in a -- a one room, expecting to -- to be transported, but it was not -- she -- she was -- she went to -- to Terezín s -- much - a bit later. I -- at that time, I published a leaflet warning the people who was the directorate in Terezín against -- it was very -- I don™t -- I don™t -- Q: So e -- were you -- in the leaflet, did you basically say look, your leaders are misleading you? A: Yes, yes, yes, yes. Q: Must have gotten you in a little bit of trouble. A: Well, yes, because I was a -- a -- not expelled , but I was suspended of the Hehalutz movement. 34 Q: So what -- what did you do then? A: Well, la -- the directorate of the Hehalutz al -- in the Hehalutz was the -- the Hashomer Hatzair, and they voted against it. They wanted to keep me. Bu-But -- because I went to live with a friend of mine, a -- a German Jews -- Jew, who was married to a -- to the Aryan Jew -- a -- a German. Q: Mm-hm. This was in Prague? A: Yes, they were in Prague. Q: So weren™t you afraid to live with them? A: No, pe -- he was the -- he was also waiting for a -- for a m-means to go to I-Israel. Q: Okay. A: Palestine. Q: Okay. So you™re no longer with the Hehalutz? A: Y-Yes, because I was su-suspended. Q: You have quite a history of that. A: Yes. No, no. I -- I -- I -- I cannot -- I cannot continue [indeciphe rable] because maybe we make another date. Q: We can do that. A: Yes. Q: We can do that. A: I can™t -- Q: I understand. End of Tape One, Side B 35 Beginning Tape Two, Side A Q: Keep speaking. A: What? Q: Keep speaking. A: What -- I pick -- I w-want to s-sp eak fluently, but I cannot speak that. Q: Well, you™re doing just fine. This is a resume d interview with Moshe Leshem. It is November 13th, 2004. This™ll be tape two, as the continuation of our interview, side A. This is Karen Michelle, the interviewer, and we™re at Mr . Leshem™s home in Tuckahoe, New York. A: You speak very well. Q: Still, let™s hope it continues. Okay, we were -- we were your -- your history of getting kicked out of the Hehalutz -- A: Yes. Q: -- I think is where we left off. A: I was kicked out because I was -- I was living with a friend of mine who has a A-Aryan wife. He -- h-h-he was from Berlin, and h-h-he had the en -- apartment on -- he took me i -- to live with him, because I was a friend of his. And a -- and I lived there, and I worked with him o -- whatever we f-found. Snow -- so we got in the snow business, and a-all kinds of business. But I -- once we were sitting at dinner, and the father of the -- of Mrs. Weisner w-w-was with us. He came from Berlin. And suddenly the -- the Gesta po man ad -- came in, and he didn™t react. He was -- because he was -- he had his hat on because it -- suddenly there™s Mr. Davis, that was the blo -- the father-in-law of Mr. We isner™s, cou -- told him, ﬁI don™ t answer because you don™t take off your hat.ﬂ Because he took off a hat, and he an swered, and it -- he™s of -- was a high official 36 of the German arm -- defense department. And in th e end he said all right, he want -- h-he want -- he -- he was i-i-insisted, that Gestapo man, that I-I couldn™t live with an Aryan wo-woman, and I went back to the -- to the Beit Karlotseim. Q: They took you back? A: Yes, yes. I -- well, they had to take him back -- back. I -- I -- I didn™t have any difficulty in -- there -- there was room that -- four -- shu -- so I went back to live there. Q: When you say there was room, was this a group home? A: Yes, yes, yes. Because Beit Hollitset, there was 30 people living there in -- in bunks -- in beds, not the bunks. Q: So how many people to a room? How was this? A: Oh well, here -- 50. Q: Oh my gosh. A: But -- beca -- I -- when I was director, I was the only director of this Beit Harthound who lived there, because I couldn™t lived -- lived in -- in a sublet in -- with some Jewish people. No, I wanted to stay with -- with -- with th e people who I was co -- [indecipherable] Q: Okay, so this was like a commune? A: Yeah -- no, no. This was -- this was a -- no, no, not a commune, because people who waited ffor certificates of -- for a transfer patient to I-I-Israel. Q: How long would people wait there? How long would they stay? A: Till they went to Terezín, because these people had -- were -- and ha -- these people were -- were -- these people were there because they waited for it, because they -- they waited in vain, because -- and now na -- a number of them from Polska Paskavuz, that is -- that™s -- was a -- a part of Czechoslovakia wh-who -- which was ceded to -- to bi -- yats -- Soviet Union, to uni -- 37 Ukraine. And they had certificates which could make them go there, becau se they s-sold their certificates and -- and -- to other people, who could pay, and among them were a number of Jews who were a-anti-Zionists. I found that out. Q: But it was a way to get out. A: Yes, yes, beca -- it -- other Jews -- Q: So in this -- in the Hehalutz group home, were there families -- A: No, no, no, because they were all bachelors, and there was and -- different -- a different home for halut -- haluktort, because women, which were only a few, because the women didn™t get certificates because -- I don™t -- everyone that got a certificate got married because in -- that™s formally married because they -- they -- ever ybody here had a -- a certificate, could bring his family along. Q: So people would do a marriage of c onvenience just to bring other people? A: Y-Yes, yes, yes. Q: Uh-huh, and di -- and what -- what was your status then when you were there, back at the -- at the group home? A: What? Q: You moved -- you were taken back in the group home because you had no place to live. A: Yes, yes, yes. Q: And then what happened? How lo ng were you there, what did you do? A: Well, I -- I-I -- there was no hope of emigrated through Israel, there was no hope, so I went to the -- to the directorate of -- to the -- and I had a-an idea, because it was autumn, the end i -- they want men, but they didn™t want women because I su -- I suggested to the Hanhalla that the -- the dir-directorate -- because they would [indecipherabl e] allow [indecipherable] to take -- take our 38 girlfriends without -- without their having work, because they agr eed to do it, there was the only Haktarah because they to -- they agreed to th is, because I found the three -- three comrades who had ra -- women, because one was married, one. A nd if we -- I went to a place c-called Oberra, and this was -- this was -- i-it was very nice. Q: What kind of place was it, what did you do there? A: Ah, because that was a farming estate. A-As a matter of fact, the owner was a German Nazi, ol-old Nazi, he had three farming stake in the -- which were originally Czech, because he was own -- th-the owner of the three places. He was very nice, because I spoke ger -- German, and I -- I spoke to him on -- what -- whichever way neede d, and he -- he -- he told me, I would have a son-in-law that did like you [indecipherable] I have a son who is stupid. He -- he was in the eastern front. He was -- was very, very nice. Q: And how long were you at the farm? A: Few months. Q: Mm. A: Because I was determined to go underground, and in the vicinity was a-another group of people who were fr -- sent by the Hashomer Hatzai r, tha -- it was -- was a -- a radical left wing group. And I -- w-we -- I talked to him and they promised to help us, or this -- or the -- or the comrades that were in that -- i-in our group, and I wi -- I-I -- they had connections to the communist underground, and they would help us. Q: Now how did you communicate w ith the other groups? Weren™t you kind of isolated on your farm? You were allowed to get out, have a social life? A: Yes, no -- social life, there wa -- wa -- there wasn™t much of a social life, because I-I c -- I visited there on Sundays, two, three times or four times. 39 Q: Okay. A: Because I -- I -- I visited th e -- the [indecipherable] office to get married, because what, I don™t want to t-take yo -- why our girls marrie d, because I got married was with -- cause they picked her o-on the transportations to Terezín. Q: So this was a marriage of -- A: Yeah. Q: -- convenience. A: Yes. Q: Not love. A: Well, becau -- I -- no -- no, I had -- this was my girlfriends for summer once. Q: Okay, so she was your girlfriend? A: Yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes. Q: Okay. And she was about to be transported? A: Yes. Q: And so you married her? A: Yes. Q: And so she wasn™t transported? A: Yes. Q: Okay. What was her name? A: Helena Rotamar. Sh-She was from Slovakia, n-not from Czech Repub lic -- Republic, there wa -- Protectorate. Q: How did you meet her? A: She was a member of Hehalutz, yes. 40 Q: And did she come then, live with you on the farm? A: Yes, ji -- h-he was one of my girlfriends. Q: One of your girlfriends? Listen to you. A: No, no. N -- he was the only one. Q: And she came to the farm with you? A: Yes, yes. Q: Okay. And so together you were looking to join the communist underground? A: No, beca -- Q: No. A: Nobody ask her to look on -- it -- in the -- in the underground, there was no -- no -- no affiliations or su -- a-a-any of the groups, becau se the conc -- communist ha -- was the only underground group who took Jews. The others were not much of an underground. Q: How did you make contact with them? A: Through the members of Hehalutz Hatzair, because they had very close copper -- co-operations with the s -- communists. Q: So then, at what point did you leave the farm and join them? A: Well, I left the farm in May, 1942, because I -- we thought then that a number of people, including myself was in -- under tr ansportation, because he le -- he -- he left bec -- because we left on the 27th of May, that is exactly the -- the dday that [indecipherable] was against Heydrich. Buc -- we didn™t know about it, and I w-went illegally, I -- I had no documents, nothing. And I went to -- to t -- Prague, and we heard fr -- the news of the -- of the murder -- murder fr -- o -- f -- o-of Heydrich who was the Reich™s protector. He was th-the number one Nazi in protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. And it was a -- a -- we™d had some Czech friends 41 fr -- and they were black mart -- black markt -- marketeers. [indecipherable] and -- and when -- when we went to their apartment, and the family was -- was ruled ba -- by th -- the woman, who he was a prostitute. But in the meantime he got married, because that -- th-the husband fell in love with this prostitute whom he hired, because he wa -- he was a very nice man. And this th -- I don™t remember the name, and he s -- he said, ﬁWe ll, you can™t stay with us, because i-if they catch us, and th-they will -- would shoot us,ﬂ yes. Not immediately, b-but it wa-wa- was -- was a -- emer -- emer --- emergency rules. And he -- she thought that I was wi -- if they shoot us all, it is ra -- all right, if you™re a -- a Jew, or n-not. And I -- at night, he -- there -- they went into apartment -- o-of course th -- they missed one because it was a million citizens [indecipherable] fra -- because they couldn™t go into all the a-a-apartment, and I stayed there, and we were safe, they didn™t come. Q: You -- your wife was with you? A: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

And I went to them, to the guy who had the -- th-this -- I ask him to give me this summons, because that summons I was legally in Prague. He shout no, yo-you ha -- you have -- you are an -- an transportations, and h-he wrote transport. But he wrote it with a pencil. I tried to argue with him, I -- I -- I -- his name was Fisgoos. He was a -- a -- a -- he was a -- a -- an fi -- official of the Czech [indecipherable] that -- in the ch -- Czech Republic. H-H-He was a Jew. No, because I -- this summons was -- was sent to the Gestapo. I w-w -- had a friend -- a friend, a-and a -- a guy who was in the Jewish community leadership, by the name of Francis Chekfreedman. I remembered him because I have ask him to send me the Gretz -- a history of the Je wish people by bre -- Gretz, of -- so I went to 42 him, and I told him what™s has to happen there. He went to the o-office where these documents [indecipherable] and find -- found my document and ga ve it to me. And i-it was li -- eeg -- legal, but -- Q: So this was the first time you™d had documents for some time. A: Yes, yes. Q: So how did that feel?

Q: You had what? A: In-Inlaids for the -- for boots. We worked for -- Q: You worked at making boots? A: No, no, inlaids. In -- inlaids. It was rabid. Q: Oh. A: In -- Q: Insoles? A: Yeah, i-insole -- insoles, yes. Q: Okay, rabid insoles you made. A: And to -- we were -- went also for the er -- German army, an -- and I don™t know how there were -- there -- fo -- for children, the -- the were on glass plates, and we made the -- they were pictures and we made the [indecipherable] waterc olors, because this was a -- the Germans did -- did allow that. Q: So that was a better job? A: Ye -- no. Q: Not a better job? A: No. Q: A job is a job? A: No, it™s -- that™s the same -- 45 Q: All the same for you? A: Yes. Q: All the same. A: And then we got into contact with the Hashomer Hatzair, and -- and they told us that I got legalized, because in -- in the mayor of a -- of a little village, he was say that w-we actually were f -- were from there, because he didn™t have to do anything, because he -- h -- I-I -- the police asked them if -- if it™s was all right, bec -- because he -- he didn™t have anything to do, because if it is -- a citizen was not k nown, he would have to report it because if he ni -- if all -- all right, that is all. Because enter that, and in --in this wa y we were legalized. But I wanted [indecipherable] as I lived a-as a Jew, I met a man called Vaslav Limberski, and because he was -- he -- I don™t know, he was a driver of a -- of a lorry -- o-o-of a -- no -- n-n-not a -- no, lorry i-is a British -- Q: Truck. A: It™s truck, yes. Because Weisner was a geni us businessman, and he go-got his driver with a trunk to -- to take our work to the Germans. And I -- he was fro m Vishnova, and h-he was in -- o -- in Bohemia as a [indecipherable] because he was in Germany, and -- and -- and I remembered the -- the -- the name, because I -- Limbersky a nd Lemberger was pretty close, and so I -- I registered in the police as Arnost, which was my name, Bohamire -- it is Limbersky. And I wa -- registers my wife a -- Maria Novakava, sh-she -- sh -- I paid one woman to give me h-her birthd -- birthd -- certificate. Well, so we were legal. I don™t know -- I -- my wife, that is number one -- Q: Out of three? A: Yes. She never worked. She -- because the -- the man who -- I never met him, who got to be the -- the mayor of the city, told me I ne -- I -- you know German, it ge ts f -- to the -- to this -- to the -- the -- to apply to the -- the language institute. 46 End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B Q: Tape two B, U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, November 13 th, 2004, continuation of the interview with Moshe Leshem. This is Karen Michelle and here we go. A: Well, I -- I -- I applied the -- th e -- to this institute, and I was accepted, because they had few people who could teach German. An d he was -- before the war, this was a Jewish institute, because -- and the director was a German, who used to be a German teacher at the same institute, Dr. Powell, very nice man, too. He ge -- he hired a nu-number of Germans Yiddish sol-soldeeps because they had Jewish wife, and they had -- they™re half Jews, and he knew about it. And after a time, the Gestapo g -- ordered him to -- to get a ll the Jewish -- all the half Jews or -- and -- and who -- and who m-miss -- miss them. And then after -- in that period, he called me and said to me, ﬁListen, the -- the -- the peopl e t-tell me that you are also half-Jewish, a-and what is the matter?ﬂ And I told him, if a man has a bit of shekel -- and I use the word shekel, you immediately think h-he -- he is a half Jew. You know , he -- I said, it is n -- I think he t-took a -- a document out of this drawer, and I signed a letter, not a Jew, not a Pole, and not a gypsy, I signed it. And wa -- wa -- Q: Very clever. A: Yeah. Q: As it were, yeah, yeah. A: Because a je -- a -- Germans in -- in s -- th e Sudetenland, they were used to Yiddish words because there were -- were J-Jews there, too, because he was employed by a Jew, and he took this as a -- a -- a -- the -- the word shekel, took this it is all right, because you -- this was a -- a word, the Germans knew this. And afterward I send a -- a yurnafarka and -- and -- and then who 47 are -- who -- I met a -- as a Jew, I met one Czec h, and -- and by the name of Lahrer, and I -- and he ex -- he thought hi-his summonsed to this yurnafarka and he went to Germany as a friend [indecipherable]. And he was in Breslau, and he wa s at b -- at the reichsbard, because he was the red -- the -- at the state railway station, and he got in uniform w ith a hakkencrosse in his coat [indecipherable] a-a-and he was -- he was a -- a -- all right. And he came, and the ger -- he wa -- had a right to come home, of course, a-after a cer tain time. And he w-was -- h-he -- I told him go to Vishnova, and -- and a -- I went through -- with him, a-and with -- we went to the cemetery and took the name Li-Limbersky, and it so happened that these were his parents, who were dead. I knew that, because th-the -- the -- the truck driv er told me his parents were dead, and I gave him 5,000 kroner and I told him if a -- I told him, as he wrote out the documents, I t -- told him to give a thousand kroner gift, that™s was an important sum. And he didn™t have change, because he -- the Roman Catholic priest went to the -- to the pub, to trans-change -- exchange it. And I told him to k -- a few documents empty and s -- stamped them. Q: So while the priest was out getting change -- A: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Q: You took the documents and stamped them. A: No, no. Yura Farkat, I was not there. Q: Okay, your friend. A: Yes. Q: Accomplice. A: Yes, yes. Q: Stamped these documents. A: Yes. 48 Q: And the priest then never knew. A: No. Because it ha -- I -- at that time, I went -- I -- I ki -- I got a -- I si -- forged documents, because I had a friend, Eny Crew, who came to the house, and h-he -- he u -- forged lino -- linoleum. He -- he was very clever. He forged the stamp of the police di rector, and -- and a s -- stamp of the -- of the district toward who -- who get ber -- who taught -- who would stand that the documents was a copy. Y-Yes, because I have [indecipherable] Q: You have with you now? You still have it? A: Yes, yes, yes, yes. Q: May I see them? A: No, no, no, no, because th -- th -- the ha -- copies, yes. Q: Mm. I™d love to them. A: Yes, yes. And that -- I -- I -- that was all right. And I -- in the -- and th-that I took a fr -- a number of people who went to Germany, because I wa -- have the friend -- a -- a -- a friend, a Czech s -- who was i-i-in the labor exchange, and he was -- he sent Czech citizens to Germany. Of course they didn™t want to go. Acts -- acts -- that is -- it is not dangerous, cause there were -- they™re -- were free, because th-they™re were not sl-slaves, because yeah, they -- they lived in camps, and they didn™t have any right to speak to Germans, and -- and that -- and then there was a bombing it takes, o-of course, not many were s -- to gentle Germany, it was a c-cat -- catastrophe for the Czechs. But of course, I had to -- I was -- spoke to that man, and he told me that it -- it -- a fantastic idea. The -- the Jews will -- will pay 5,000 [indecipherable] and I -- Czech also -- what™s 5,000 kroner, I -- that™s -- it ™s [indecipherable], and I™ve -- and I -- and I-I had three or four men who went and I can -- I can it -- I couldn ™t find any other to exchanged, because the Jews were afraid, were afraid. 49 Q: Now how did you separate your life out, the people who wi -- knew you were Jewish, and the people who thought you wouldn™t -- you weren™t? Did you behave in a certain way to -- A: Yes. Q: -- some people, and a different way to others? A: Yeah, no, I -- the -- the Jews -- I -- w-were people who knew me, not -- not strangers. Q: Okay. A: Because a -- and -- a -- among the Jews, the Jewish women whom I -- whom I wanted to exchanged was a Stella Kurswalawa -- Lebolawa, because he -- I was -- I met her after w-war in Israel, and he told me you will, of course, write, because he was with my mother in Auschwitz, and h-he was g-gassed, because that™s was the last transportations wode -- wi -- which went to the gas chambers, yes. And that -- we -- wis -- was in ™44. Q: Very late. A: Yes. And -- and that is -- th-that™s was a -- a -- in -- I couldn™t deliver Jews, I couldn™t, because they were afraid. And i-in addition to this, I forged a lot of doc -- documents who I didn™t know. I -- cause tha -- that w-was a Czech friend, Eleanor Gevishava, who was a -- a -- increbil -- increbit -- incredible -- i-if -- she was a -- she wa-was a -- a -- one of the few Czechs who was named a righteous -- a Righteous Gentile [indecipherable] the nations. I™ve also -- also one of the sponsors, and sh-she came one day and asked me -- asked me show the documents, the I.D. cards fr-from -- o-off a Jew from -- or a Czech Jew who e-escaped from Poland and Russian soldier. I think he -- he was a -- a -- a lieutenant who was cate -- ca me from the prisoners of war c-camp, and he -- I -- he wanted me to meet with , I refused because wi -- all the time Eleanor didn™t know my real name, because I told her my name was Kaliw ater, because I knew that the communist underground force, there were n-Nazi spies in there, and they told me that the-they -- 50 they ha -- they witness enough destructions of Jews, I™m -- I think it™s was a -- w-was a -- that just the first mass destructions of Jewish -- Jews in Poland. I forget the name. I can look it up. Q: Okay, all right. A: What? Q: Amazing. A: Treblinka -- Treblinka. I think it was Treblinka , and she asked me to speak to the Jewish community and tell him -- them, about it. And I got a -- a -- a -- the woman I to -- I want to send to Germany, you -- the -- the mistress of Rick art Israel Friedman, who was the -- he was the Viennese Jew, because when Gestapo send to pr o -- P-Prague, because he -- there was a -- an understanding. He was the -- the Gestapo man beca -- he -- he was not a traitor. Of course, the -- the -- Greece considered [indecipherable] a tra itor, because h-he was -- he was a go-between. And -- and I told him this story, and a few weeks afte r -- after I told this Stella, and he -- he told me that I -- I shouldn™t panic the Jews, and he ma de a hint that he knows where I was living, and I -- I knew that ri -- Friedman must have known this thing a-all the time. A nd wi -- and after -- a few weeks afterward, the two were shot, because -- how one man, a Czech shot two German guards, cause he missed them. And a -- he was a -- a -- he was a -- a -- a -- a agent of the Gestapo, and she -- he threw away a briefcase, and there was all the -- all the member of his group, and I was not among them. Of course, maybe I was Kaliwater, because he didn™t -- didn™t know -- know my name. And -- and all the -- all the members of this group were arrested, and ol -- only one came back. Because he -- everybody wa s kept alive three months, because they tortured him, and they -- they got a -- to -- they -- they wanted to tell them more about that school. This guy was three months -- was -- was kept three months, a-a-and he was late, he was arrested late, because he -- i-i-in the meanti me, the war was over, he -- he came back. And 51 Eleanor was also arrested, because he was not on the list. All -- they found a book with her name in it, and he was arrested. Q: She was. A: She was arrested i -- on the -- as a consequen ce of this book name. A nd he -- she ta -- told them this i -- I -- I lost the book, because I -- I don™t know how -- who got hold of it, and she wer -- was freed. And she -- sh-she was -- sh -- and she telephoned me, and -- and -- at the language institute. I -- Q: Where you were teaching German? A: No, no, I don™t know, because he -- he never knew my name. Q: Who didn™t know? Your -- you r wife didn™t know your name? A: What? Q: Who didn™t know your name? A: Eleanor, becau -- I -- no -- Q: She didn™t know your name. A: Yeah, because he telephone -- no, I don™t know. I -- I don™t know how -- I don™t know how -- how he got it to touch with me, neither before and afterward, but she got it -- in touch with me, and I continued to -- to deliver documents, and I remember that I have two blank paper of the S.S. hauptkrotere, because that -- that was the gene rous stuff. And I gave her one -- I gave her a dogod -- do -- go -- document that™s this -- th-there is no objections that this -- this man can go to his visits and h-he -- he lived with this docu -- document. Q: Now this may seem like a strange question, but I™m curious about this. It seems that people -- well, not -- it seems like people obviously had to lie and be deceitful, and keep track of all of these different forms of truth -- 52 A: Yes. Q: -- all the time. Did you practice doing that? A: No. No. Q: Because it takes a really good actor to convince the people. A: No, I -- I™m not a good actor, because we met We isner and I -- I must tell -- tell you that I got a -- a I.D. card from Weisner too, because fr -- he was called [indecipherable] and h-he was a genius because he -- he went to Germany and in -- in no time he was a millionaire. He -- and he came back to Czechoslovak -- to [indecipherable] pr otectorate, as -- as a dosta, because he wa -- has the wife was living in Prague. And he -- h-he was fantastic. I -- and -- am in contact with his son in Hamburg. A-And he died 45 years old, a -- a heart attack. And w-w-we talked freely, but not to the people outside. Q: Now at what point did you stop working for the underground, di-did you say okay, I™ve got to get out of here myself? A: Who? Q: You. When did you finally say, time for me to go? A: Oh, there cus -- there came a -- a period in Czechoslovakia, after war, who let all the Jews out of Czechoslovakia. [indecipherable] i-i-it™s a -- was the -- the anti-Sem ites in the communist party wanted the Jews out, because -- Q: So where were you when the war was over? Officially over? A: In Prague. Q: Still? A: Yeah. Q: Okay. 53 A: Yeah. Q: Okay. A: And I -- it changed my -- my -- I™d -- I made Arnost Limbersky my official name. I -- I went to the police headquarters, and I told -- told them I want to le galize my name. [indecipherable]. He says, but wait a second. And he came back outs, I said -- he said we cannot do that, because there is the ar -- arrest -- no -- Q: An arrest warrant? A: Yes. Of course -- Q: For you? A: Yes, yeah. You were suspect -- I told him who signed, he said -- he says the Gestapo. And of cour -- I think you are a -- you are an idiot. And that™s it. Q: Now where was your wife at this time? Number one? A: It was with me. Q: So it was still with you then? A: Yes. Q: Okay. A: Because I -- I -- I told her during the war th at I will divorce her the moment th -- the war would end, I -- I -- yes, she didn™t believe me. I - I -- I -- I took the blame on me, because -- and th -- the -- the judge, after he divorced me, on my fault, he told me to come to his chambers, and I came there, and he says -- says -- she said, ﬁI wou -- you had the witnesses against you, but I warned you not do that any more, because othe rwise I would not divorce you f -- f -- in your fault.ﬂ Is -- he -- he knew. Q: That it wasn™t for real? 54 A: Yes, yes. Q: So you -- you got divorced, this was in Prague? A: Yes. Q: Okay. And then -- and then she went her way, I guess. A: Sh-She is -- she was still in Prague, I -- I don™t know whether she is alive, but she™s -- she lived in Prague. Q: And you, you went, you left? A: No. Q: No. A: Y -- no, I got married to -- to my second wife, a nd we left -- we -- we left together for Israel in ™49. Q: Okay, who was your -- what™s the name of your second wife? What was her name, number two? A: Hava -- Ava -- Hava. Q: And her last name? A: Lodeska. Q: How did you meet her? A: She was a -- a -- a -- I -- I met her, she was a teacher, English. Q: Okay, so you got -- how long after you divorced number one did you marry number two? A: Few weeks. Q: Okay. Cause number one, that wasn ™t love, that was convenience? A: No, no. Q: Yeah, okay. Number two was love? 55 A: Yes. Q: Nice, okay. And then you decided to go to Israel? A: Yes. Q: What was the process of getting there? A: This was easy.

Okay, so we™re into going -- why did you just -- why did you want to go to Israel? A: I was a Zionist. Q: Yeah, but I thought you wou -- had conflicted feelings about Zionism? A: No. Q: No? A: No. Because th -- I was -- I -- I guessed that the Communists would be not a -- a -- a -- not for justice, and -- and yi -- I guessed that the commun ist party would be subject from -- to Russia, and that -- it was a -- as -- a -- a terrible regime, and that made me go to Israel, because my wife w-was tr -- tref -- pressing me to go to Israel . I -- I have a daughter in Israel. Today is her birthday, 58 years. Q: When you went to Israel, what did you expect? A: Expect? Q: Mm-hm. You remember that -- first, do you remember the date that you arrived? A: In the -- May, ™49. And I had friends there who helped me get it -- th -- in the -- the foreign sservice, because I -- i-in Czechoslovakia, I had Israelis who went to Czechoslovakia in -- in my official capacity and I got to -- to meet and then t -- the Israeli minister, because in this -- that™s was not an ambassador [indecipherable] because the -- i-i-in -- medium states had ministers o -- and because this was Ahoud and Abriel, and we were ver -- we got very friendly. Q: So you were then made an ambassador? A: No, no. 61 Q: You were in the foreign service? A: Yes. Q: And what did that mean at the time? A: Foreign service? Q: Yeah.

Q: What was the feeling of -- a-and what name did you use then, when you were home? A: Limbersky, because I changed my name to Leshem. Q: When did you change it to Leshem? 62 A: I don™t know, beca -- very soon, very soon. Q: After you got to Israel, you cha -- A: What? Q: Soon after you got to Israel you changed it? A: No, because I-I was in the foreign office a-at that time. All the o-officials of the foreign office had to change their name. Q: Why? A: Yes, because that was an order. Q: No matter what your name was, you had to change it? A: Yes. Q: Then how did you decide what name to take? A: I looked i-in the dictionary, a-and I found Leshem . Because i-it -- that no longer exists, this word, no longer. Q: You looked in the dictionary and does le -- what does Leshem mean? A: I -- that™s the -- the high priest had 12 stones, each one for one -- for one tribe, and Leshem was the tribe of [indecipherable] done. Q: Okay. A: Because it is not clear what Leshem was, because Leshem is this -- I don™t -- nobody knows what it was.

Yes. Because that was my Hebrew name. Q: Right, of course. So you could have been Moshe Maccabee instead for all -- A: Yes, yes. I could have.

Q: So as this new person, what did you feel that you could do as this -- as a new person at -- of 31 years old in this new country? A: Well, I was in the foreign ministry, because I -- th-this was my profession. Q: You had no real profession, you had been so many things just to -- to be, to survive.

But [indecipherable] the Jewish community -- the secretary of the Jewish community told me that I should not invite him. Q: You™re kidding. A: Yes. Q: Why would he say that, or she? A: Because -- h-he -- because this was a segregated society. Q: And even Jews -- A: Yes. Q: -- followed that? A: No, because he was afraid that the whites -- the -- the w-w -- the whites would take offense if I invited Martin Luther King. But I wanted to, but -- Q: Little bit ironic, no? A: Yes -- no, no. Because this is very complicated, the -- the relationship there, because the -- the -- the rabbi of the temple roths -- Rothschild was -- was against segregation because he also had to be careful.
