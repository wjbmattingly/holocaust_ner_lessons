Lily:WhenIwasalittle girl,myparentsspokeRussianbecause whentheywenttothe universityandbeforeIwas born,Vilnawasoccupied byRussiaandthe youngpeople,atthistime, spoke Russian.Then whenIstartedtogetolder,myfather onetime camefromworkandsaidwehavetospeakPolish.ThechildwillhavetogotoaPolishschoolandsheisstilltalking Russian.Then theywere startingtospeakPolishbut whentheirfriends cameand whentheyaretalkingbetweenthemselves,Russianwasthelanguage thattheyspoke.Anthony: Didtheyspeakanyotherlanguages betweenRussianandPolish?Lily:TherewasaJewishpaperthatused tocome.Mymother didn't readJewishbut myfatherreadtheJewishpaper.Iimagine that mymother spokeJewish.Butwhen shespokewithherfriendsorherfamily,itwasmostlyinRussian.DoyouknowtheJewishpopulationhadthreelayersofsociety?Therewerethesepeople thatwereassimilatedJewsandthey mainlyspokeRussianandPolish.There werethepeople thatwere youngZionistsandtheysenttheirchildren toHebrewSchoolandtheyweretrying tomakeHebrew alivinglanguage. The thirdlayeroftheJewishsocietywaspeople thatbelievethatYiddish isthelanguage oftheJewishpeople. Therewereveryfamous ﬁRagymnasiumﬂ[?](88)thatweretaught onlyinJewish andthechildrenweresenttothisschool.They weretaught Yiddishand theywere speakingbetweenthemselves alsoinYiddish. Therewere likethreelayers ofJewish society.Unfortunately, myparentswere veryassimilatedand they,because oftheirprofessionalbackground, feltthattheRussianrevolutionandtheRussianlanguage iskindofsalvationforallpeople.Theybelieved inalltheideals thatsoundedveryniceonpaperbut unfortunately fellapartlater.

Welivednearbyfromthemedical faculty ofthe university.Iremember theriots,itstartedatthe synagogue riotsanditwasveryhardfortheJewtogotoamedical university, amedical college.InPoland, itwasdifferent.Whenyoufinishedhigh school,youdidn't gotocollege. Yougoright awaytouniversityandyouhadtomakeupyourmind what youwantedtostudy.Nowhere,hereyougotocollegeandthen yougotomedical school ortolaw school.Overthere,itwasdifferent. ItwasveryhardforaJewtogoinand studymedicine. FromthewholeschoolthatIwentto, itwasaprivateschool,justonepersonwasacceptedperyearforaperiod oftwoorthreeyears.Sothosefewmedical students thatwereintheuniversitystudyingmedicine, Jewish, were reallypersecuted. There wasatime thattheywere notallowedtosit. They wereassignedspecial seatsontheleft. They rebelledandtheywere standing upandtheywere takingnotesduring thelecture. Imetsomepeople afterliberationthatweremedical students inVilna andthey weretellingmeaboutthosetimes.

Anthony:DoyouknowwhyyourparentssentyoutoaprivateJewishschool? Lily:Myparents wanted metohavethe besteducationandthis wasavery fineschool, oneofthebest.IwishIcouldgivemychildren thekindofeducationthatIandmysisterhadaschildren.Theprofessorswereveryeducated; theywerehighly dedicated. Most ofthestudents were motivated.Therewere some children thatwent therejusttopleasetheir parentsand triedtogetaway butwehadmovies,wehadachemical laboratory,wehadaphysics laboratory;wehad fieldtrips;wehadagym,gym wasimportant;wehadallkinds ofvisualaidstomaketheeducationmoreinteresting. Alsowhenwehad French Revolution, theywere teaching usaboutFrench Revolution.Itwasnotthattheytoldusabout RobespierreandMarat, butwehad amock judgment.

This isthereasonIwassentthere.Anthony: Howwouldyoucharacterizerelations betweenJewsandnonJewsinVilna?Lily:TherewerealotofantiSemites. Ithink thatItoldinthepreviousinterview thatmyfatherwasreally havingaveryhardtimewhenhewent foranexam. Yousee,myfatherwasworking inapharmacy. Thiswasapharmacy fromaverybigpharmacy thatwasfrom thecitypharmacy. Every workerthatworkedhadakindofinsurance.Whenheneeded aprescription, hewenttothispharmacy.Itwasaverybigoutfit; itwascalledﬁCasa Horichﬂ[phonetic] (324). Itwaslikeabiginsurancefortheworkers.Fromthis pharmacy wasemployed alotofpharmacists, onlythreeJewishpharmacists wereemployed. In1935,thosethreepharmacists were toldthat theydon'thave enougheducation;theyhavetogoandpassatest.Theycannotdojustasimplepharmacist;theyhavetohaveMastersinpharmacy. ItwascalledMagisterderPharmazie.Herewasmyfather,ayoungman,withawifeandtwo children, andhehadtogotoworkandalso study.Iremember thatheusedtogoanddig upallkindsofherbsandstudyallkinds ofthings.Heusedtoclosehimselfandstudywhatever,hejusthadachance. Then hewentforthetest. Thetest wasinthemedical facultyoftheuniversity. Unfortunately therewasaprofessorthereandhisnamewasMacheski,oneofthe biggest antiSemites. Hepassedthewrittentestandthenhepassedthe oraltest.Ashewascoming out,heaskedhim, bythe way,whatisthechemical formulaforcarbonatedwater? Myfather wassounnervedthathegotamental blockandhedidn't answerhim. Hedidn't passthetest. Sohehadtostudyagainand hehadtotraveltoWarsaw.Hewentthere andhepassedthetestthere.Irememberwhenhesentusatelegram, "Ipassed!" anditwasoneofthebiggestjoysforus.Butitdidn'ttakelongandallthree Jewishpharmacists weretoldthattheyhadtogo.Theydidn'twant aJewtohaveacivilservicejob. Anthony: Soeventhough hegottheMastersand hequalified,hestilllost?Lily:Yes,helost.Thenwehadlikeafamilypowwow.Helostthejob.Wedidn't know whattodo.Soitwasdecided thateverybody willhelp him andhewillhavetobuyapharmacybecause hecouldn't get ajob.When hewent tobuyapharmacy,hefoundapharmacyinaplace called Soy[Salos],Soly.AsaJew,hecouldn™t buythe pharmacysosomehowhefoundaPolish pharmacist whosenamewasVishnefski.Hegavehimasumofmoney, thisVishnefskibought the pharmacy andmyfatherwastheownerandheworkedthere. ThisVishnefskiwasnot eventhere.Thiswasin1938. Anthony: That'swhenhelosttheshop? Lily:Helosthisjobin1936or1937.Forayearorayearandahalf,hedidn'twork.TherewerealotofantiSemites. Anthony: Didyounoticewhetherthere wasanydifferencebetween PolesandLithuanians, forexample? Lily:Well,actually, Ididn't getintouch duringmychildhood toomuch withLithuanians. Istartedtoknow Lithuanians when,in1940, Russiatookoveranditthenbecame Lithuania.Soforayear,youknow,but–alsoIgotintouch withLithuanianswhentheywereguarding the ghetto. Theywereverytall,the:policemen.Weusedtocallthemﬁaniterateﬂ[?] (391), this howtalltheywere.Lithuanians werealsoveryantiSemitic, veryantiSemitic, especially thosewho weresympathizerswiththe Germans. Anthony: Ifyouhadtocomparethetwo,wouldyousaythatonewasworsethanthe other?Lithuanian antiSemitismorPolish? Lily:Iwouldsaytheywerejustbothofthem werebad.Itishardtocompare. Anthony: Earlier,youmentionedthat there were someantiSemitic pogroms? Lily:Theywere actuallynot pogroms. Theywereriotsbetween the students,between thePolishstudents andtheJewishstudentsandtheuniversity. Anthony:Butyouwere protected from allthatbecause youwere stillgoingtotheJewishschool?Lily: Iwasprotected because, first ofallIwas alittle girland IwasgoingtoaJewishschool.Anthony: Howaboutyour mother?Whowereher clients?
