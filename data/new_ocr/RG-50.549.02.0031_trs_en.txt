SL: It™s when you reach certain ages the weeks disappear. Q: Right. SL: I™ll tell you, the years disappear, it™s just unbelievable. Q: Mm. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 10 SL: People say, ﬁI™m going to retire, what am I going to do? It™s going to get bored.ﬂ We haven™t got enough time here. Q: Right. SL: Just unbelievable. Q: Mm. SL: Time flies, the weeks disappear, the years. Like we just went to New Year™s party, right? It™s another New Year™s already. Q: Yeah. SL: Yeah. Q: Yeah, I feel the same way.

And it™s a little bit past 10:30 in the morning and I™m thrilled to be here, very honored to meet you both and thank you for having me. SL: It™s our pleasure. RL: [indecipherable] USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 11 Q: And as I told you, the -- the -- this interview will be a little bit different than the one which I watched the video of. And it™s -- and it -- you can help me direct it. So if it™s going in a direction that you think is less important and you have something else you™d like to talk about, or just something you don™t want to talk about, then just let me know, we™ll just go to [indecipherable] thing. SL: Okay. Q: Some of the questions I have for you are ju st some questions that I had that weren™t fully explained in the video, and then I have other questions that we™ll start after -- after you left Buchenwald. O-One of the questions that I had was -- was, could you describe for me again, your perception of the -- the relationship between Jews and Gentiles in Kovno when you were very young? SL: Before the war, you™re talking? Q: Yes, before the war, mm-hm. SL: Well, before the war, the relation between the Jews and the Gentiles was very good. Q: Mm-hm. SL: I mean, they didn™t show no anti-Semitism, right. And never make -- like we had ra -- Gentiles working for us, right? They were the finest pe-people you ever met. Even I used to play with the Gentiles, they was never say, hey you dirty Jew or things like that. Everything was friendly, except one -- we used to have a boy that used to take care on our property where we lived. He used to be a janitor. And when Hitle r start to come in power, you know, and he used to listen to the radio, and he be -- this guy became very USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 12 anti-Semitic and he used to say, ﬁIf Hitler ever comes to this country,ﬂ he says, ﬁI™m going to kill Jews.ﬂ Openly, he used to say it. And my grandfather said to him, he says, ﬁYou™ll never live to see that day.ﬂ All right? That things just stuck in my mind. I was a baby and I still remember it, right? And sure enough, my -- my grandfather died in 1938 and -- and Hitler -- Hitler came in and took over Poland and this guy was -- and the Russians came in, and he don™t like the Russians, this ja -- this -- this janitor, right? It was a janit -- yeah, it was a janitor. And then when -- when no -- when the Germans attacked -- no, the Russians, in 1941, the day before, that was a Saturday, the man dropped dead, okay? The Russians came in -- the Germans came in to Lithuania on -- on -- on Monday, right? Saturday that man dr opped dead, okay? He never lived to see the -- see the day. Because if he would have lived, he would have killed plenty Jews. Q: Mm. SL: Bec -- They became so anti-Semitic after that, it was just unbelievable. I guess ma-maybe because they didn™t like the Russians, because the Russian depressed them. So maybe because of that, but they were such a -- so anti-Semitic, they were worse than the Germans. Q: I -- I know this is something you can™t really answer, but how do you explain that? How do you explain that sort of general getting along and then this in-incredible betrayal? SL: I don™t know. Maybe it could have been jealously, because the Jewish people in Lithuania were we -- we -- pretty well off. And we -- we had the -- in -- in Lithuania -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 13 in Lithuania was about 250,000 Jews, out of a population of a million and a half people. So we™re a big percentage. Q: Yeah. SL: And -- And the Jew didn™t -- I mean, they used -- they even used to speak Yiddish in -- advertisement in the street used to be in -- in -- in Yiddish. We used to have Yeshivas there and we -- we had the very sh -- very famous Yeshiva in Slobotka was ve-very famous. And I guess maybe it was jealousy. And I guess when the Germans came in and they were -- they were the -- they were depressed into the Russians and the Jews owned -- owned a lot of things, the chance to take everything away from the Jews. Maybe that™s where they turned. Because -- Because the Lithuanians, the Latvians, the Estonians and the Ukrainians, they were worse than Nazis. They were -- All the killing, actually, was done by them. Very few Germans that -- that did the killing. All the dirty work was done by them. Even be -- When the -- When the Germans came in and all the pogroms was done by the Lithuanians. The Germans din -- We were come -- We were ra -- We ran away, you know, when the bobocart, and we start to run towards the German -- to the Russian border. And what happen, there were a lot of bombardments on the road and we were going by horse and wagon, you know, and the Germans were mechanized and next day they passed us alr eady. So we stopped in a small town, I don™t remember the name of it, and you know, they to ld us that we have to back where we came from. And while we were going back, on the roads, the Germans stopped us and ask us where are we going. So we told them we™re going back to Kovno. So they told USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 14 us, ﬁDon™t go this way.ﬂ He says, ﬁYou go with everybody, the German troops coming down the road, nobody will bother you.ﬂ Because they said, ﬁIf -- If you™re going to go this way, the Lithuanians are killing everybody -- all the Jews and taking everything away from them.ﬂ I guess they had a chance to take things a -- t-take things away from the Jews and that™s it. Q: An-And how do you explain this message from the Germans? Why did they -- Why did they do that for you? SL: They won™t -- I tell you, they di -- all those killings, that they weren™t that bad in the beginning of the war. The mass killing started in 19 four -- in -- in -- late in ‚41. That™s when the mass killings started, and actually, the-they started -- the --the -- all the killings were in -- in the -- in the Kovno ghetto in Lithuania. They we --the -- that™s where all the experimentals -- the killings started. Q: What -- What were these experiments? SL: Well, to see how the -- how they used to gather all the Jews and they used to get them in certain places and just shoot them. Because, I have a book about it, you know, and -- and that™s where -- that™s where they -- they claim that most experimental killing started in Lithuania. Q: But I -- I don™t understand what the experiment was. Was it -- Was it to figure out -- SL: Mass -- Mass killing. Q: Was it to figure out that -- most efficient way to kill people? USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 15 SL: Right. That™s wha -- That what mass killing. The only ghetto that turned into a concentration camp was the Kovno ghetto. Beca me a concentration camp in 1943, so -- Q: While you were there? SL: Yeah. I was in the -- there was only -- there was only -- there was only about 5,000 Jews, from the Kovno Jews, Lithuanian Jews that survived the war. Out of -- Out of almost a quarter of a million Jews. And that included the -- the -- the ones that ran away to Russia. So, it™s just -- and I lost most of my -- my mother got killed the day before liberation. Q: Yeah, I know. SL: Mm. And my -- One of my -- my father™s youngest brother, he and the whole family went right in -- in -- in -- in the -- ri ght in the beginning, when they took the first akcha. And they came -- Made us gather on a -- on the parade ground. And there™s a [indecipherable] was go -- like Mengele, like in the -- in the be -- in the -- in being the Birkenau. Q: Mm-hm. SL: He was calling us a whole day, who -- who should live, who should die. You take as -- this side and you -- you -- if you were on the left you were safe, on the right you went to death. That day, out of 40 -- 42,000 people, one ti -- one quarter of the people went to the -- it™s called a nightfort, and that was the killing ground. So over 10 -- over 10,000 people went to the -- in that ca -- get killed. Q: How -- How many people were -- were in your family? USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 16 SL: Well, my father had the -- altogether there were 12 children, so -- so five were in America and seven were in -- were in th e -- in the Kovno, Lithuania. So they [indecipherable] ca -- you™re talking the -- the general family, or my father and my brothers? Q: Yeah. SL: My family. Well, we were f -- we were four brothers and my mother and father. Q: Well your -- your father had 11, there were 12 children -- SL: 12 children. Q: in your father™s fam -- in your father™s family? SL: Right, right. Q: So, he had 11 brothers and sisters? SL: Right. And there was a big family [indecipherable] I mean -- Q: And some of them were in America already? SL: Yeah, five of them. Th-Three brothers and two sisters in America and seven were in Lithuania, Kovno. Q: Mm-hm. And then how many got killed that day in -- well, that -- at the nightfort? SL: Well, the nightfort that time was just one of my uncles with the whole family and my aunt and her husband and two -- and two da ughters. The rest they didn™t tak -- they didn™t take, because, see my father used to work brin-bringing in food, also. Like we were -- we were on the bia -- on the oxia there, and what happened, they told us to go on the right hand side. And my father was out of the ghetto and when he came back, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 17 you know, he -- he -- he -- they told him about the yakchi that™s going on and my father went to the commandant from the ghetto, the German. And he says, ﬁAnd my family™s there, you know.ﬂ So the commandant went with my father and they found us and they took us out because we were on the wrong side. We were on the right side, we were supposed to be killed and my father saved us. So -- And my father and my brothers, they survived the war and ja -- the only one that was killed is -- was my mother, because my father used to watch over us. Q: Mm-hm. SL: And my -- my -- my mother just got killed the day before she wa -- li-liberation. And my brother got killed in -- after the war. Q: Now how did he get killed? SL: My brother? Q: Yeah. SL: Well, it was -- see, after the war, after the vi -- they were liberated from Dachau, they went back to -- because my brother, the one that got killed -- Q: What was his name? SL: Haim. Q: Mm-hm. SL: He wanted -- They made up that if we mi -- survive, we™re going to meet in Kovno, right? And he wanted to go back to look for my mother. So the whole family went back. See, because I wasn™t with them, cause as a child, they took me away to be killed. So USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 18 after that -- So when they went back to Lithuania, they couldn™t get out no more, because that was Russia. Q: Mm-hm. SL: So they were stuck there and he -- he was working and he was working as a cab driver there, in Lithuania. And -- And there -- there -- as I understand it, he t -- he took somebody, a fare to the -- to his girlfriend, and this guy killed the -- the girlfriend and didn™t want no witnesses, so he killed my brother. Q: In the taxicab? SL: Hm? Q: Was he in the cab? SL: No, that wasn™t in the camp, that was in 1963. Q: No, no, in the taxi. SL: No, that was a -- yeah, he killed him in the taxi. Q: Y -- W -- Shot him? SL: Mm. A man goes through a war, all right? Saw hell and gets killed ba -- by -- by a jealous what they call it, a suitor, whatever they call him, right? Lost his life. Wonderful man. Q: How old was he when he got killed? SL: 1963, he must have been about 35 years old, 36 years old. Young man. Left two children -- two small children. Q: Where are they now? USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 19 SL: Well, they™re in Israel, they moved to Israel. My -- My sister-in-law -- I still call her my sister-in-law, wonderful woman. And she ca me to Israel in 19 seven -- ‚76 or ‚77, and she remarried there, to a wonderful man. When I come to Israel, my sister-in-law and her husband, he calls me my -- I™m his brother-in-law. Wonderful man, and wonderful people. Q: So you keep in pretty -- SL: Oh yeah, keep in touch. Q: Pretty good contact. SL: Listen, I™m closer to her than my own brothers now. Just a dif -- it™s a different feeling. We are ba -- very close. Q: Wh-Why do you think? SL: Well, I™ll tell you. I did -- I didn™t know my brothers for so many years. I mean, I didn™t -- I didn™t see my oldest brothers until 1989, because they were in Russia and you couldn™t go there. So, I didn™t see them. The same thing with my other brother, Shlomo. It™s -- The af -- The affection is not there, the closeness isn™t -- not there no more, because for so many years -- you didn™t see somebody in 40 years or so, you know. Q: They still live in Kovno? SL: No, they™re in -- they™re in Israel now, yeah. Q: When did they go to Israel? SL: Well, one -- my brother Shlomo went in 1972. He was one the first ones, that when they -- they let the -- the peop -- the Jewish people could apply going to Israel, he was USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 20 one of the first one to apply. And for two years he lost his job, because once you apply to go to Israel, you lost your job, you couldn™t work no more. They wanted to persuade you you shouldn™t go. Q: Mm-hm. What was his job? SL: He used to drive a cab in Lithuania. Q: Mm-hm. SL: But -- So he didn™t -- he di-didn™t have no -- he didn™t have no -- no job, he couldn™t work, because -- because of that. And -- But he insisted, I want to go to Israel and that™s it, and he went. And my other brother -- my father was supposed to apply to go to Israel, too. And three days before -- before he got his visa to go Israel, he died in Lithuania. Q: Your father? SL: Yeah. Three days before. Q: What year was that? SL: In ninet -- 1976. Q: And how old was he? SL: My father was -- in ‚76? No, ‚73 my father died, I™m sorry. ‚73 my father was ‚73 years old when he died. Q: He was young? SL: Yeah. Q: What -- What happened, he was sick? USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 21 SL: Well, I gue -- I guess it™s the heart. Listen, what the man went through during the war. Q: Yeah. SL: -- you know, and he™s so -- i-it™s a wonder all the survivors, that the way we came out is a miracle. Q: It is. SL: Yeah. Even I myself, I mean, the way I came out. Most of the people, you know, was mentally and a lot of them just had problems, but thank God. Q: Well, I was going to ask you about this later, but let me -- let me ask you now and then I™ll go backwards. Explain to me -- wa -- one thing that -- that wasn™t -- that I didn™t understand when I listened to your -- your story, when you left the children™s home in France and went to look for your father and brothers -- SL: Yeah? Q: And you found out that they had left Germany on [indecipherable] SL: When they went to Lithuania, yeah, in 1945. Q: Tell me what happened when you found that out. How -- Tell me again how you found out and what you reaction was and why you decided to go back to France? SL: Well, I meant -- I met somebody, right? And we start to talk, you know. So he says, ﬁWhere you from?ﬂ So I told him, I says, ﬁI™m from Kovno.ﬂ He says, ﬁDid you have pe --,ﬂ my name, he says, ﬁYou know, I met somebody, Simon Lurie, right?ﬂ ﬁYeah,ﬂ I said, ﬁthat™s my father.ﬂ He said because there was -- af-after liberation -- they were USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 22 liberated in Dachau together. So -- So he said -- So he said th-they -- that™s why I know that my brother and sister, the one to go back to Kovno. And he says, ﬁYour brother Haim only wants to go back to Kovno. He was looking with you -- want to look for the -- for his mother.ﬂ See, but before I -- before I te -- before -- before I -- I got in -- in -- in the children™s home, right? I found out that my father was alive. And that™s -- that™s when I wanted to go back and be with the family. Q: Mm-hm. SL: And while I was on the train, I met this guy. Q: On the train to? SL: I was going to -- to Germany. Q: Right. SL: Going to Dachau, and he -- he told me that the -- you -- you -- masta -- met this guy and they start to talk, you know? And there was -- he -- he says, ﬁWhere you going?ﬂ I say, ﬁI™m going to see my brother and my -- my brother™s and my father. We™re going to meet.ﬂ Because it™s -- and it™s -- he told me, he asked me what™s the name. He said, ﬁNo, they went back to Kovno.ﬂ Q: So why did you decide to go back to France instead of trying to go to Kovno? SL: Well, listen, I didn™t know where they were in Kovno, right? And I know the Communists were no good already, right? So this way I know where I was. Q: Mm-hm. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 23 SL: This way, I had friends over here already and this way I got a little better chance to survive. Q: To come -- SL: Beca-Because after -- after I -- when -- what I -- the way I knew how to take care of myself already. Q: Mm-hm. SL: Because it™s not like they -- the children here these days and they -- in America, you know, a -- a 10 and 11 year old is a baby, a 20 year old is a baby. You have to ge -- You have to take of them like a babies. The ch ildren that survived during the war, were not babies. At eight years old they were not babies no more. Q: Well, was that a difficult decision for you to make? Did you have to stop and think about it? SL: No, I didn™t. I knew it -- not difficult. Q: When you were on the train and you found out that your father was back in Kovno -- [indecipherable] SL: Yeah. It wasn™t a difficult decision at all. Just -- Listen, this is spur of the moment. Q: But you were going -- you had to back to France first. Was your plan already to come to the United States? SL: No, no, no. That was a little later. What happened, we were on the children™s home and somebody came from the Red Cross. And we were talking about it and I remember my grandfather should rest in peace, he we nt to see his children in America, 1934. Now USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 24 he was rach -- I very attached to my grandfather and I wanted to go with him to America. So, he didn™t take me, I was very upset. But I remember that making my -- and also my father and my ma -- we used to get letters from America and I remember New York, right? So one day the man came from the -- from the Red Cross and asked anybody if they got any family in America. And I remember my na -- my father™s brothers. I remember, cause it™s -- the name is the same as my father and my -- and his brothers, my uncles, right? So I gave one that my father has fam -- brothers in New York. And what happened -- when that -- when th-they put it into the Jewish paper, and my cousin was looking to the Jewish pape r and she saw our name, Shya Lurie is looking for -- for uncles Ike, Ithzac and -- and, gee I forgot the names already, [indecipherable] loo -- an-and looking for the uncles and aunts. So, sh-she wrote me a letter and she asked me what my father™s name was, what my mother™s name was, what my grandfather™s name was. And I got back a letter. That™s -- Q: You were still in France? SL: Yeah. Q: And who -- And who wrote -- SL: Said they decided -- They as -- They ask me if I want to come to America. Listen, I was alone anyways, right? I said, ﬁDefinitely.ﬂ So they made out papers for me, it took almost -- almost about two years, a year and a half or so, a little more than a year and a half or so, til they brought me over here. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 25 Q: Well, just explain to me so I understand it, cause I -- an-and I -- I™m -- I don™t mean to be -- to be challenging you, I™m just curi ous why you weren™t trying to get back with your fo -- with your father, and when -- and at what point did you find out that your mother was [indecipherable] SL: Well, that we found out much later. Q: Yeah. SL: Because my -- my aunt -- my cousins were telling me. That was many years ago. I didn™t know when -- when she died, see? But my aunt and my cousin, they were in the same camp. Then they were in Stutthof, and what happened, we™re -- had a cousin that was sick, some -- and they were liquidating the camp. So my -- my -- my -- my mother says, ﬁI™m going with -- with -- with -- with my niece.ﬂ So my Aunt Hannah was [indecipherable], and my cousin Edka. Says , ﬁBazil, come with us. Leave her, she™s sick.ﬂ She says, ﬁI can™t leave her alone.ﬂ And she wouldn™t leave her alone. Now, my aunt and my cousin survived. Q: And your mother probabl y knew the consequence. SL: I don™t know if they knew or not, but they -- listen, e-e-eventually, I guess everybody knew. Q: Mm-hm. SL: And they -- I -- I -- I understand they drown them in the -- and they drowned them. They sunk the boat. They put them all on th e boat and they drowned them. Listen, my mother was a wonderful woman. She gave her life to be with her niece. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 26 Q: But so -- so help me understand what was going on when you were in France and why -- why -- how it was that you decide to come to America and not to try to go back [indecipherable] SL: Well, I knew where the Russians were going there, okay? And then there were -- I didn™t want to go back to Russia, ma -- I kne w before the war how they were and after the war, they were worse yet. So I didn™t want to go back to Russia. And first of all, I didn™t know if -- if I come to -- to Kovno, I know da -- what would it be, because in Russia you never knew. You could be in one place here and next day the-they -- they shipped you to Siberia. Here, I know where I was. And listen, I was very independent already, I could take care of myself. I guess it™s -- it™s fate, it™s destiny, it™s meant to be, it™s meant to be that way. Q: But I guess what -- what you -- is it accurate to say that this is two different reactions to the murders that you saw and that you knew how murderous the Russians could be, that your father and brother wanted to go back for some reason and you didn™t want to go back. SL: Well, they wanted to go for a certain purpose. My brother and sister, they wanted to go look for my mother Q: Yeah. SL: [indecipherable] They didn™t know what the c-consequences they went through. Q: Right. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 27 SL: Now, but -- but that time, I knew wher e the consequences. Once you go in there, you can™t come out. You could come in, but you can™t go out. Even when I would start to write to my father, even the letters, they didn™t go through. Finally I got through a letter and when I got a letter back from them, used to be opened and censored. Cause see, they used to open up the letters and censor it, to see whether I -- and used to take maybe five or six months before I used to get a letter from them. If I wouldn™t a known what was going on in Russia, I might have gone back. But I knew what was going on there. And I tell you, when you went -- you go through a war like that, you become very selfish, too. End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B Q: This is an interview with Mr. Sol Lurie for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, November 30th, 1998, conducted by Steve Roland. This is tape one, side two. SL: -- letters and censor it, to see whether I -- and used to take maybe five, six months before I used to get a letter from them. If I wouldn™t a known what was going on in Russia, I might have gone back. But I kne w what was going on there. And I tell you, when you went -- you go through a war like that, you become very selfish, too. You become very cold. Don™t know wh -- you look out it -- for yourself. It™s like an animal, survival. So if -- You™re not attached no more. The feeling is not there no more. Q: Le-Let me ask you this. You said in the -- in the other interview, that at a certain point, you made a very firm decision, that you would try to outlive Hitler. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 28 SL: I did. Q: Or that you would outlive Hitler. SL: Yeah. Well, that™s how I survived. Q: Tell me what made you -- what was it th at pushed you to that decision, or how you came to that decision. SL: Well, I had a lo -- I always had a lot of willpower, all right? And the only way to survive, you have to do -- it™s something to look forward to, which is why -- once you give up, that™s it, right? So, if you make a goal in your -- in your own mind, I™m going to accomplish this, right? And -- And -- And -- And that™s when it -- that was my goal. I want to survive so badly and I made my goal that I™m going to outlive Hitler. And that™s what kept me going. Q: So it -- How -- How important was that for -- like the difference between those who survived and those who didn™t survive? To have a goal like that, where that -- SL: The goal was very important, because if you haven™t got a goal, and you don™t set your mind on something, you™re not going to do it. So, there was so many times that ee -- I pee -- I want -- you want to give up. But just the thought that I might outlive Hitler and ca -- when I went back to Germany -- I™ll tell you later about -- when I ba -- came -- went back to Germany in 1953, right? And I came back -- I came back as an American soldier in occupied Germany, I was the pr oudest human being you ever saw. Because I show you, you want to kill me, and I came back alive and I™m an American. That -- That was my pride. People said, ﬁHow could you love the Germans?ﬂ Right? But USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 29 [indecipherable] this -- this -- when I came back, I used to walk down the street, I was proud. I even became an American citizen in Germany. Q: You became an American citizen -- SL: American citizen in Germany, okay? Q: Well, tell me about that. SL: Okay, when I was in the army, I went -- I went in the army, I wasn™t a citizen yet. So -- And they send me back -- send me into -- to Germany, instead of -- in the Korean war. And then they -- they -- they made a new -- a law that the -- the -- that if you™re in the army, you become a -- you going to become a citizen. I was one of the first ones to became an American citizen in Germany. So I we -- I went to Frankfort, in Ame-American headquarters, and that™s where I was sworn in as the American citizen. And it™s written on my discharge, too. So when I came -- when I first came back fa -- after the army, I came back to vote in the -- in the elections and I came into the -- when th-they asked you where did you get your American citizenship papers. I says, ﬁI got it in Germany.ﬂ So the woman that there was re gistering me says, ﬁDon™t be no wise guy. What do you mean you got it in Germany?ﬂ I says, ﬁLady, I got it in Germany.ﬂ She says to me, ﬁIf you don™t play around -- stop playing around, I™m going to call the cop, he™s going to throw you out.ﬂ I says, ﬁLady, you could call the United States army. That™s where I became an American citizenship.ﬂ And I took out my paper, you know, my si -- my American citizen paper and showed it to her. She thought I was kidding around. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 30 Q: How important was it to you to become an American citizen? SL: Very important, I didn™t have to go to th e army, but I went, because when I came to this country and I saw what the -- I know what the country did for me, the way I was treated. I had freedom, I could say anything I want, right? And I want to fight for this country, to preserve the -- [indecipherable] the freedom. I didn™t say the -- it™s a legitimate war, it™s not a legitimate war. When the country calls me, I went. I didn™t have to, but I went. I™m very proud of it, too. Q: And do you remember that day, that moment when you became a citizen? SL: Oh yeah. I was very proud. Yes I was st -- I was standing -- I was the fi -- the only one, and when the headquarters of the -- the seventh army, I was the only one that -- that was sworn in as the American citizen that day. And I had -- I had the two or three witnesses from my company there, to be witn esses, sigh? I was very proud. I was also written up the Stars and Stripe. That™s where the -- That ne -- beca -- Q: What is that, a -- a military newspaper? SL: Yeah, it™s an American newspaper. Q: Mm-hm. SL: That -- That -- That -- That™s a new law that came out. Q: Which it -- What was the law? SL: The law that once you serve in the army, right, you -- you™re the ma -- you become an American citizen. Because, see, they couldn™t send me in combat because I wasn™t a citizen. So they can send you in occupied terr -- if you volunteered, you could send you USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 31 in occupied territory. I could have gone to the -- the Middle -- the Middle East, but I could have gone to -- to Japan, I think, like that, but I -- in combat they couldn™t send you. That™s why I™m [indecipherable] from now -- from the whole company, when I -- when I was in the -- in the -- in the Korean war -- that was the height of the Korean war, right? And 90 -- 90 -- 97 percent of the compan ies used to go right to Korea. Me and two other guys went to Germany, that was it, because -- Q: Because you weren™t citizens? SL: Yeah. Actually, I didn™t have to go, but I wanted to go. Q: Now, of all the places to go, was Germany a difficult place for you to go? SL: No, I -- I came back, I -- I was very proud, that I was telling you. I was very proud because I came back, I showed you, you wanted to kill me, you couldn™t do that and I came back as a -- an occupi -- occupied your country. That was my pride. I used -- And when used to walk in Germany as American soldier, I was like a hundred feet tall, like a giant. Felt great. Q: What -- Was there any -- What was the climate in the army for Jews? Was it -- Was it difficult? Was there any anti-Semitism [indecipherable] SL: No, no, no. First of all there was very little Jews in my company, right? Q: Mm-hm. SL: In the whole -- the whole regiment -- I was in the 26th inf -- the regiment, there was only about four Jews, that was it. So when it came to a Jewish holiday, we didn™t even know. I didn™t know when Yom Kippur was or Rosh Hashanah. But there was no anti- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 32 Semitism. Most of them were -- Well, first of all from the -- from the south, they were real hillbillies. And they mu -- know much anyway. They ask me, ﬁWhere you from?ﬂ I says, ﬁFrom New York,ﬂ and I have a air -- had a very big accent, I still have, right? And they say, ﬁOh, that™s the way they talk in New York?ﬂ Right? They didn™t even know I was a foreigner. They thought a Jew had horns. They didn™t know. I used to be [indecipherable] some guys in our -- in the barracks there and the only pictures they used to have in the -- in their war locker, used to have in the pigs and the cows. They never had a family picture, you know, like a mother or father, or -- animals, that was it. They couldn™t wear no shoes. Shoes used to come off from the -- from the training, you know. Used to take off the shoes, they couldn™t walk -- they couldn™t wear shoes. But very nice, very nice people. They thought a Jew had horns and things like that. Q: So were -- were they surprised to find out not -- that all [indecipherable] New Yorker -- SL: Yeah, then -- I was very friendly with them. Q: Yeah. SL: I was ver -- I was very close with them. Had a lot of friends there. Listen, what people don™t know -- anti-Semitism is only ignorance. When you talk to -- When you -- When you tell people that don™t use their own mind. Don™t know how to make up their own mind. They don™t think for themself, that™s when anti-Semitism comes in. Q: Mm-hm. SL: And the person that doesn™t know nothing, is not anti-Semitic. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 33 Q: I™m putting up a second microphone for my -- myself. When I record the interviews for my radio programs, I don™t record myself. SL: Yeah. Q: But for this one they asked me to and I forgot. I™m sorry. With the -- Let m -- I want to go ba -- I know we™re jumping around in time a little bit -- SL: Yeah. Q: -- but I wanted to -- because we -- some of the important things to me, when I -- when I hear th -- your story and the other stories of survivors, is to understand what was special, what were -- what were the ingredients of their survival and I know part of it is -- is luck. It™s just having -- SL: 99 percent was luck. Q: Yeah, but -- SL: And somebody has to watch over you. I put -- See, I™m a very strong believer in fate. Q: Yeah. SL: In destiny. And I believe somebody™ s watching over you and you -- not-nothing™s going to happen to you before your time is up. Q: Mm-hm. SL: See, I p -- I personally believe in my grandfather, hey? He™s the one that watched all through the war over me. Q: Now ca -- You -- You mentioned that several times and this was a -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 34 SL: Yeah. Q: -- the-these were the two things that I picked up from the interview that were very important, was one, your determination to live beyond Hitler, and then your being watched over by your grandfather. But could you explain how that manifests itself, or what it -- what it actually was, in terms of him watching you? SL: Well, see, when I was a child, I was very -- my grandfather used to live by us. I was very close to my grand -- whatever -- I was like a little dog, right? Whatever my grandfather went, I used to go with him. I used to go to shul with him, whatever. To my aunts, my s -- children, right, whatever. And I fe -- I was very close to him, see? And he was reu -- he was very close to me. He wa -- He loved me, [indecipherable] and -- I fi -- and that™s the only one, [indecipherable] I was a child and the way I felt, he was always there whenever I needed him, when I was a child, right? And the same thing during the war. I mean, there were certain -- certain th ings, like he told the guy, ﬁYou™ll never see to -- li-live to see that day,ﬂ right? The day before Hitler started the war, he died, okay? Q: How old was that guy that died, I forgot to ask you that. SL: That man? Q: Yeah. SL: He must have been in his late 40™s. Young, young man. Q: Yeah. SL: Well he said, ﬁYou™ll never live to see the day.ﬂ And that was a prediction, a couple of years before it. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 35 Q: Mm-hm. SL: And the man never lived to see the day. So, there was something there. There™s so many -- There™s so many fi -- instance, you know , so many instances that I™ve -- I went through like a miracle. Nad in the war, and ev en after the war, the -- certain things. 19 f -- 1987, right, I was walking around like a time bomb, I didn™t even know it. Q: With your heart? SL: Right. Now, sigh -- like a miracle, my -- my -- my -- my right ar -- my right ventricle -- right ventricle? What do you call that? RL: Your right side of the heart. SL: Right side of the heart took off ma -- took over the work from my left heart, because my left one was completely closed. RL: The coronary artery. SL: Now, when you -- if you ever read the report, you would never believe it, right? The doctor wrote the report. My wife is a RN, right, and she couldn™t believe the report. Now, you don™t -- you mean to say that somebody™s not watching over me? Q: Mm-hm. SL: Mm. Somebody™s watching over me. The same thing now. One of my -- my grafts closed up, right? But what happened, my -- my ha -- my body developed new ca -- carotical circulation around the heart, right, right. Somebody li -- if wouldn™t be for that, I would have had a massive heart attack. Q: Mm. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 36 SL: And I thank God I don™t need nothing. I just take medication, that™s it. But shows that somebody™s watching over me. First of a ll, my wife needs me, okay? I need my wife and my wife needs me. And it™s still -- my time is not up yet. So is -- it shows, there™s something there in destiny, right? In fate, hm? Q: Is there any connection between this strong belief that you have and this -- or this knowledge that you have of somebody wa tching you and -- and your religion? SL: Yeah, the religion has something. I™m not -- personally, I™m not religious. Q: Mm-hm. SL: I believe if you are a good human bei ng, you have a good heart, you don™t harm nobody, you help people when they™re in need, that™s the most important religion. It™s nit -- It™s not what you -- It™s not what you -- you -- you -- you say abba, it™s what you do. If you do good things to people and you help people, that™s a religion for me. Q: Mm-hm. SL: It™s not if you go to synagogue or you go to church and you -- and you pray and you say that and then you come out and you steal people -- from people. That™s not religion. Somebody is in need, I™m there. Q: But was it -- What -- I guess what I™m cu rious about was tha -- I mean, that™s -- that™s an important distinction and -- and I would -- and -- and I think that it™s -- well, it™s -- it™s not an uncommon view. I mean, my family is the same -- of Jewish people who are not particularly religious, but have very strong sense of values and ethics. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 37 SL: The most important thing is values. See, because the Jewish religion, the most important thing -- that™s where the Jewish religion -- that™s what I was taught, okay? That if somebody™s in need, be there for them, right? Never close your door. The same thing, it™s like Passover, right? I mean, they -- you open up the door for Elino -- Elionowa to come in the house, your door™s supposed to be open. In Europe to the synagogues, right? I mean, if you couldn™t afford it, to pay for the -- for the ti -- to give a donation to shul, the shul was open for you. In America it™s different. If you don™t -- can™t pay for the -- for the -- for the shul, you can™t come in. And that™s not religion for me. That™s a business. And that™s what happened, that™s what a busin -- religion became, it™s a business. I mean, not everybody could afford it, there are certain places in -- that you have to show them how much income you have and you have to pay a certain percentage. I want to send my kids to Yeshiva and I went to one of the Yeshivas, right? And the rabbi told me, this is my price. I told him I couldn™t afford it those days, right? He says, ﬁWell, if you can™t afford it, you can™t send your kids to Yeshiva.ﬂ And he told me wife, she rest in peace, he says, ﬁIf you want to send your kids to Yeshiva, you go and clean floors. Become a housemaid and you make money to pay me,ﬂ okay? Now -- This is not by me a rabbi. I told him, I says, ﬁIf you paid me, I wouldn™t send my kids to Yeshiva, because you can™t teach them nothing. You can™t teach them the ethics. And by yours, the -- the ma -- th -- ya -- the money™s more important than -- than to teach somebody.ﬂ I went to another Yeshiva, says, ﬁWhatever you can afford to, you pay us,ﬂ okay? And that™s the right way. And I gave my kids a Jewish education. If I USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 38 couldn™t hav -- I couldn™t do it, I wouldn™t have given it to them. And believe me it was hard, whatever I paid those days, too. But my wife, she rest in peace, she wanted to give the kids a Jewish education. Q: Mm-hm. SL: I™m not sorry for it. Q: Mm-hm. SL: Kids were brought up right. Q: And just -- How -- How did you -- This -- This sense of values that you got, who would you say was the most responsible for teaching that to you? Was it your -- your parents, your grandfather? SL: Well, my parents and my grandfather. Q: Mm-hm. SL: Because it was in the home. Q: Yeah. SL: Our doors were always open, even for the workers. Did -- Those -- Those -- The people that used to work for us, right? They were crazy about the gre -- my grandfather, my -- see, in Europe, everybody had a nic kname, right? They gave everybo -- And my grandfather, they gave a nickname, Smogas -- Smugus. Now, in -- in Lithuanian, it™s -- it™s a huma -- a real human being guy, a real fine person. That™s -- Tha -- That Smugus means a very fine person. Q: Mm-hm. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 39 SL: And that™s what my grandfather was named. Q: What was his real name? SL: Is this -- Labe -- Lable -- Lable in He-Hebrew, it™s -- it™s a lion. Big man. Q: And this was -- whose father was he, your -- SL: My -- My -- My father™s father. Also my mother™s -- my mother™s parents also were -- were nice people, but I wasn™t as close to them. I got something through my -- from my mother™s gr -- parents, also someth ing good. I™m a cook, I love to cook. My grandfather was a well -- well -- really well-known cook. RL: Your grandmother. SL: My grandmother. Q: Yeah? SL: So, I got -- I got something from her, too. Q: So what did you -- did you learn to cook from her directly, or you just -- SL: I didn™t learn, I just -- I guess it comes with it. Q: Mm-hm. SL: I love to cook. Looks -- Looks good. RL: He loves to cook. Q: Yeah? What™s his specialty? RL: Anything you want. SL: [indecipherable] I like to experiment. I never cook the same way twice. Q: Yeah. I like to cook, too. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 40 SL: Mm. Q: I always liked it, when -- since I was little. SL: I™ll let you taste my lasagna. It™s -- But, see something falls off. But the thing is, you see, we were brought up to respect people and -- and to help people. And that™s the way I was brought up and it stays -- it -- it stayed with me, see, because they -- they got in this country, right? I mean, they come from a bad environment, that™s why the children are bad. There™s no such a thing. It™s the house. It™s what the parents teach children. See, the -- All the Holocaust survivors, right, that survived the concentration camp, and the -- and the how as they saw, that a human li -- a human life didn™t have no value. Just like an ant, you step on it and kill it, right? I mean, everybody came out, they should have been killers and murderers, right? And everybody -- I would say 99 percent of the people that came out are very successful, respectful citizens, wherever they went. And they don™t -- I don™t know [indecipherable] Q: And what™s you explanation for that? SL: Because they had a good upbr -- upbringing in the home, the value. Q: Before? SL: Right. Q: Now, see if you can explain something to me. I have two children who are six and 10 years old. My perception is that these issues of the values that we teach them, that my wife and I teach them, are very important and very big, because they don™t know that much. So I™m envisioning you at 11 - 12 years ol d, these values and these relationships USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 41 that you have with your parents and your grandfather, it™s very big. And your understanding about what you just described about helping people and about being good to people, leaving the door open. H-How -- How does seeing what you saw affect -- affect it? It™s a -- It™s almost hard to understand that -- the balance. SL: Yeah, the thing is, you see, it was instilled in me -- Q: Mm-hm. SL: And I was taught as a child, that no ma tter what you saw, after -- because you could teach somebody a certain age. After a certain age, that™s it, right? So, when you were taught at a cert -- my -- at my age, a yo -- young age, how to da -- how to be to people, how to respect people, right? That if you see a woman, you open the door for her, right? Or you see an older person, you get up and give the seat. And if you see a woman -- especially a woman, even if it™s younger than you, right? You get up and give the seat. And that™s what instilled in me, to show respect. And I s -- I still do it now. Even when I -- I sit somewhere and I see a woman next to me, I get up and give her the seat. Or I go out and walk and I open that door, right? I™ll hold the door til si -- the person comes over. Now you see in young generations, right, the young people, they don™t even say thank you. Like it™s coming to them, because it™s taught in the home. There™s no res -- There™s no respect. Listen, [indecipherable] they see -- I must have this. Whatever they see, they must have, right? He grew up, he had two toys, was enough. You™re growing now, they™ve got hundreds and hundreds of toys, right? And it™s still not enough. And whatever the child wants, they pay. Listen, there™s no such thing, you must have it. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 42 Make use what you got. And -- And when I -- When I -- I -- I mean they -- the children, five, three, four years old, they have no respect no more. By us, I remember as a child, it was child -- you could be seen, but not heard. You couldn™t say nothing. And you did -- If an older person spoke, you -- you f -- y-you -- you kept quiet. Here, an older person speaks, forget about it. Q: What I™m curious about is -- is how a ch ild like yourself, or other children, who have such a -- such a good upbringing and such a respect for other people and for elder people, how do you then make sense of the -- the horrible things that -- that were fostered upon you and the horrible things that you saw? SL: You mean I ca -- well, I figured this, we [indecipherable] it had to be that -- I -- I s -- I have a certain belief, you know, the questions here, where if there was a God, right? How could it let it -- things like this happen? Q: Mm-hm. SL: Now my explanation is -- the way I th ink, that you don™t question what God does, first of all, re? And also, the worst punishment for a parent is when the li -- they punish a child, right? There ca -- can™t be nabarena -- the worse punishment than punishing a child. And God was punishing -- punishing the parents when they to -- when they -- when they punish the children. Q: Mm-hm. SL: So, that™s -- that™s one of the things. But you can -- you can™t take it, there™s no explanation. There™s no explanation whatsoever. You don™t question. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 43 Q: Mm-hm. You were 13 when you were -- you were in a concentration camp when you turned 13, right? SL: Yeah, I was -- when I went into the ghetto, when the germ -- when the Germans came into, I was 11. Q: Mm-hm. So we -- What did you -- Were you -- Were -- Were you Bar Mitzvahed? SL: Nah, Bar Mitzvahed? Q: There was no way, right? SL: No Bar Mitzvah. Q: Was that -- SL: I was always in hiding, because the children, used to take away. Q: Yeah. SL: I was taken away a couple of times. Q: Was that a problem, to -- to -- to miss a Bar Mitzvah? SL: No. Q: It wasn™t important? SL: Who -- Who was thinking of Bar Mitzvahs? Q: I don™t know, I™m just curious. SL: We -- We di -- We didn™t even have no shawls those days. We used to -- We used to pray in the -- in -- that nobody saw, hey? You didn™t have no prayer books, you didn™t have no shawls. Listen, people with beards, they used to shave -- the Germans used to cut their beards off. You just -- You just -- Bar Mitzvah never bothered me. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 44 Q: No. SL: Listen, the religion the -- hala -- it™s -- it™s not just the -- the only thing a Bar Mitzvah is, if you go before the Torah and they present you and you -- an-and you become a man. Over here they make a big thing, Bar Mitzvah. But in -- in Eu-Europe they didn™t make no big things. Q: I see. SL: Most of the thing was done in shul and that was it. Q: Mm-hm. SL: What -- Th-Th-Th-Th-There -- Those -- Those things never bothered me. If it be meant to be, I would have had a Bar Mitzvah, but to show that my -- my -- my -- what they call the -- the -- my destiny. I wasn™t meant for a Bar Mitzvah and didn™t have no Bar Mitzvah. Q: Mm-hm. SL: My biggest belief is destiny. That™s why I don™t worry about everything. Whatever is going to be is going to be. I live at present, see? I don™t care -- I know what the past was, I don™t care what the pre -- what the future is going to be. Live right now. Because why should I worry bou -- say something™s going to happen? Why do I have to worry what™s going to happen? I even taught my children the same way. Don™t worry how to cross the bridge to wa -- before you get there. A lot of people, they worry, before -- before they get -- b-before something happe ns. Why should I worry about it? I guess the cant -- the time I spent in the c oncentration camp taught me that, too. Survive at present. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 45 Do I know what™s going to be next mi nute? No, nobody knows. So you live right now. And a lot of people are saying the same thing, they finally seeing it. Same thing my son, too, as I say, he™s going -- he™s going to be get -- going for his Ph.D. in psychology. Also, he used to worry about everything. I says, ﬁCharles, what are you worried? When you get there, you™ll worry about it. Why should you worry now?ﬂ She used to tell him the same way, yeah. Now it™s -- after it™s getting -- where he™s going to get his p -- finally, he™s getting a little common sense. Listen, education doesn™t mean nothing. It™s the common sense that counts. I don™t care how educated you are. You could put -- Your most educated human being was stupid. And a little common sense, by me is more important than -- than education. What good is it if you™re smart, but if you don™t use your head the right way? Q: Mm-hm. So t-tell me -- I -- I wanted to go -- start with -- just ask you a few things about the -- the liberation at Buchenwald. SL: Oh, I™ll tell you a story about it -- Q: Wa -- Okay. SL: -- my liberation. Hell, you brought it up. I moved in over here two and a half years ago. And last year, a men moved I -- moved in five houses away from me -- I™m in 119, he™s in 129, right? And when he came in -- a nd we are friendly, I walked over to him, I introduced myself and we started to talk . And he saw my accent, you know. He says, ﬁWhere you from?ﬂ So I told him, ﬁI™m from Lithuania.ﬂ He says, ﬁNo, where were you during the war?ﬂ I says, ﬁI was in the concentration camps,ﬂ right? He says, ﬁWhat USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 46 concentration camp?ﬂ We start talking what concentration camps I were in. And I says, ﬁI was liberated in Buchenwald.ﬂ He says, ﬁYou know, I was the first tank into Buchenwald.ﬂ I meet my liberator after 50 year -- 51 years. I meet my liberator who liberated me, you know? Is that a coincidenc e? And I -- Is-Isn™t that re -- destiny, something? Q: What™s his name? SL: What™s his name? RL: I don™t know. SL: Take a look in the book. I™ll tell you in a mi nute. But that™s a coincidence, isn™t it? Q: It™s amazing, yeah. RL: He doesn™t want to talk about it at all. SL: And the thing is, when I was ta -- I was looking -- I was looking out from the -- from the -- from the concentration camp and th ere was a ba -- there was woods there, uh? And I saw the tank coming down the perimeter of the -- of the -- of the -- of the forests, right? And I saw the ee -- that tank coming into the gate, coming right through the gate. And I meet him after 51 years. Now we had the -- We had the -- I had the interview with Spielberg here and I want him to be in, you know? RL: Sol, what number? SL: 129. And I want him to be in the interview, you know? Of course -- Q: Yeah. SL: You know he™s -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 47 RL: [indecipherable] SL: He says he couldn™t go through with again. He couldn™t go through it again to talk about it. RL: [indecipherable] something like that. 129. Q: Oh yeah. Now, what™s his background? RL: Well, he™s very quiet. Q: Jewish? SL: Very quiet man, he le -- he™ll -- he™ll -- Q: He is Jewish? RL: Yeah. SL: Huh? He didn™t want to be with people. Even -- Even when he lived over -- He lived in -- After the war, he didn™t want to be with people. He lived like in a farm, secluded place. Very quiet man. End of Tape One, Side B USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 48 Beginning Tape Two Side A Q: This is an interview with Mr. Sol Lurie, for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, November 30th, 1998, conducted by Stev e Roland. This is tape w -- two, side two. SL: -- quiet man, he le -- he™ll -- he™ll -- Q: He is Jewish? RL: Yeah. SL: Huh? He didn™t want to be with people. Even -- Even when he lived over -- He lived in -- After the war, he didn™t want to be with people. He lived like in a farm, secluded place. Very quiet man. He told me, because he said, first he said his daughter is sick, then he told me why he didn™t want to be in interview. He says, ﬁI couldn™t go through it again.ﬂ I says, ﬁListen, if I could go through it -- when you talk about things like that,ﬂ he says, ﬁI can™t talk about what I saw.ﬂ But the thing is, you know, when you talk about something, you feel better. Q: Mm-hm. SL: I used -- I also used to be -- I used to talk a little about it, but I didn™t talk about it much, til I open -- had my open heart surgery. It™s like somebody said, ﬁHere, you got another chance in life. Open up and talk about things.ﬂ I opened up, I talk about it. My whole personality changed. I mean, I became like a different human being. My wife knew me -- She knew me -- How many years she knew me? RL: A long, long time. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 49 SL: Okay? She can -- My -- My personality changed. My friends, right? They couldn™t believe it™s me. I became more open, I became more -- I like to make people happy, I like to make people -- RL: Likes to joke. SL: Joke around a lot, right? RL: [indecipherable] round -- around a lot. [indecipherable] SL: Before I was very serious and s -- but you got another chance in life, and use it. Q: Did -- Did you make a conscious decisi on after the war to not talk about it? SL: No, I guess -- it™s not -- it™s not a conscious decision. It™s certain things that when e -- l-like, even the -- there™s certain things I blocked out from my mind. I don™t even remember it, okay? Now, when I read -- I read a book, right, from the koba -- Kovno ghetto, it comes back. Q: Mm-hm. SL: But you just blocked it out. You didn™t want to talk about. Something -- I guess your mind -- your body itself has certain shut off valves and it -- it cuts it off itself. It™s the same thing like a pressure valve. If you -- If you [indecipherable] a valve to release, you would explode. See I -- I use my body as a plumbing system, right? That™s the way I use my body. And if you built a lot of pressure up and you don™t release it, you haven™t got a valve to release it, you going to explode, the same thing as a hot water heater, right? And the same -- that™s the same thing with your body. I use my mouth as a si -- kitchen sink, see? If you put in a lot of garbage, right -- if you watch what you put USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 50 in, your sink is not going to clog up. If you put a lot of fat in it and a lot of grease, your arteries are going to clog up, right? Same thi ng, right? So that™s the way I use my body, I -- I -- that™s the example I ha -- I give myself and that™s the example I give people. It™s to understand how it works. And it should work that way. Q: Hm. SL: Because when I was young I used to eat a lot of junk, so my arteries closed up. Q: Hm. So tell me a little bit about -- so after -- after the -- the tanks came in in Buchenwald, what was the treatment like? I know you tal -- you talked it -- about the -- that was very interesting about the -- the food that the Americans prepared was too rich. SL: Oh, yeah. Q: People got sick. SL: Well, after we were liberated, they came in and the Americans, you know, the -- a lot of people were sick, you know, they were starved. And they came in and th -- and they started to cook. They started to cook pigs with all kind meats. Very greasy food. People the -- their intestines were all dried up, right? And they started to eat like -- I mean, the people are hungry. Now me, like somebody was watching me too, right? And the -- the only thing I was eating is potatoes and bread. I wouldn™t take -- maybe because my religious upbringing, a -- the hahsa, right? And you couldn™t eat no hahsa, and that™s -- that™s -- not -- non-kosher meat, right? May-Maybe cause of my uupbringing, I was saved about it. But the only thing I ate was bread and potatoes, right? Now, people were getting sick, they were getting dysentery. Te-Tens of thousands of USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 51 people died after the liberation because -- from the dysentery. Their intestines were all dried up and this -- they got diarrhea and they were just dying like flies. Q: But other than that, what was the -- was the treatment good from the Americans? SL: Oh yeah, very good. Listen, when they came into the camp -- and Buchenwald was one of the best ca -- was one of the best camps I was in, the same thing with Dachau, Dachau was also a good camp. But co-consid ering, you know, it™s -- the treatment was very good. They treated too good, and weren™t used to it. After abou -- After about a week or so, they took us out from the -- they got all the children together, they took us out from the ca -- from the camps, where the German soldiers used to -- used to bring the barracks there, they had like big buildings, at least, I think four or five story buildings. And they took all the children and they put us into those barracks there and that™s where we stayed. And then they did as -- the f -- the fren -- the French -- French government, the S-Switzerland, Holland, Engla nd. This -- They started to take some children, you know, because most of them, they were without parents. Q: So, of that group of 500 children -- SL: 522. Q: 522. How many went to France with you? SL: A couple of hundred went -- went to France. Some went to -- I don™t know how many went to Sweden and some went to England. Q: And where you went in France, were there other children from other camps there also? Or was it just those -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 52 SL: No, in the -- in this -- in this -- this one, the -- the -- there was only from Buchenwald. Q: Right. SL: Okay? But this -- this -- the organization that took us over is the Ozair, if you ever heard of it. It™s a -- It™s a -- It™s a -- It™s a Jewish organization. Q: Mm-hm. SL: And they -- they -- the one that we were in, that was strictly from Buchenwald. That was with Elie Wiesel, well, and -- Q: And tell me a li -- What was your life like there, in that place? SL: Oh, it was very nice. Listen, we were running around, I mean we had our freedom. They were trying to teach us a trade. They taught us -- Some people went to sc -- first of all, we went to school to learn a little French. So these the teachers and then some -- said all the ones want to learn, to l -- to -- to learn trades. The life itself was very good. We stayed in the -- one of the places we stayed was in Rothschild™s pi -- one of his palaces there, all right? But the thing is, he didn™t give us the palace, he gave us, for this, the stables, the servant quarters, where the horses used to stay in. But still, listen, it was very nice of them, it was very comfortabl e. We had -- We had plenty to eat. They gave -- They even drink wine, even when you™re children, they give you wine, right? I mean, over there, everybody™s a alcoholic th ere. And we played games. We have soccer, we used to have sports and -- listen, we had a little chil -- a ga -- a child upbringing a little bit, you know. We weren™t used to things like that. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 53 Q: Was there -- Were -- Did some of the children stay in France? Was there some expectation that those children who went to France would stay there? SL: Oh some of them, yeah. Yeah, some of them stayed there. Q: Mm-hm. SL: There™s quite a few that are still -- still live there. Matter of fact, a couple of years ago, I met -- I met one of the -- two guys actually, that live in France, they settled there. See, but right after the war, I mean, the Fr ench government took us, but there was a lot of anti-Semitism there. A lot of them. I mean, right -- you know what the Jews went through, and re -- and when they were -- we -- we came there, they showed it. They didn™t -- still didn™t like the Jews. To this day, they don™t like the Jews. There™s only one place in -- in all France that -- that were friendly to the Jews. If you ever heard of Shablon, I think it was. This -- They -- They -- They saved the whole Jewish population there. They wouldn™t give up one Jew. But the rest are anti-Semitic, they don™t like the Jews, they don™t like the Americans. That™s why we never go back to France. I™ll go back faster to Germany, than go to France. People say it™s so beautiful there. I says the -- the country is a beautiful country, but the people are rotten. And any place that don™t like me -- don™t like me as a person, as a Jew, they don™t like me as an American, I would never go back and -- and spend a -- a penny there. RL: Sol? SL: Hm? Which one? RL: All these are people from -- from France. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 54 SL: Yeah, wait, let me see. Q: Are they -- SL: That™s right, we met some -- RL: Yeah. We had a reunion. SL: Oh yeah. This guys here. This guy -- Q: Wait, wait. Put this in the front here, so -- SL: Okay. Q: -- that you can -- so you can -- SL: This man over here, see, is a Frenchman. He came for a visit. Q: Right. SL: See, this guy -- his name is -- what™s his -- which is tha -- I forgot his name. RL: Arya. SL: Oh, Arya, okay. Or this -- Also this guy here is also from France, see? Q: Mm-hm. SL: But this guy Arya, we were going to the same synagogue in Brooklyn together, right? Q: Mm-hm. SL: And I was -- I saw him in syn -- the synagogue maybe for about 10 - 15 years, right? Now, this guy never talks about it, doesn™t talk about the war at all. I mean, if you ask him a question about the war, he gets ve ry upset, doesn™t talk about it. And there was -- When I came to shul once, and we™re sitting and talking and he says -- and one of USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 55 my -- my -- my -- somebody I know says to this guy, ﬁHow are you?ﬂ He says, ﬁWhat do you think, you™re in France? You™re chasing all the girls?ﬂ So I says to this guy, ﬁArya, when were you in France?ﬂ He says, ﬁRight away you want to know my life hist -- biography?ﬂ I says, ﬁNo,ﬂ I says, ﬁI was in France, too.ﬂ He say -- I says, ﬁI was there in 1945.ﬂ He says, ﬁSo was I, in 1945.ﬂ I says, ﬁI was in the -- in the Ozair, this and this home.ﬂ He said, ﬁFor -- So was I.ﬂ I says, ﬁDon™t tell me you were in Buchenwald.ﬂ He says, ﬁYes.ﬂ He says, ﬁOh, you the leedfacshiker, right?ﬂ Now, all those years we sit in the same synagogue and the man never want to talk about it, right, because he doesn™t want to talk about the war. An -- Ba -- And then it came out that we were in the same concentration camp. RL: They knew each other. SL: Okay, we knew each other. Now, that™s the guy I show you on the picture. RL: With this -- Q: Oh. SL: In the concen -- Q: Yeah. SL: That™s the guy Arya, okay? Q: Hm. SL: So it shows, if somebody talks, you ca -- RL: But these two were also with you in Buchenwald. SL: Yeah, yeah, those two guys were. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 56 RL: Those two guys. Q: Where was this photograph taken? SL: That was in Brooklyn. RL: In Arya™s house. SL: They -- They -- They -- That -- They came -- They came for a visit. See, this guy Arya keeps in touch with everybody. This guy has like a -- he™s like a fa -- a computer walking around. He remembers all the name, he™s ga -- even got the ki -- kids from Buchenwald all over the coun -- all over the world, right. He knows they™re in Australia, in Canada. He remembers the name, he keep in touch with everybody. Q: Well then, I don™t understand. He -- He -- He™s the one who wouldn™t talk? RL: Yeah. SL: Yeah, he doesn™t talk, see, but he keeps -- Q: But he -- But he keeps in touch with everybody? SL: -- he keeps -- he keeps in touch with the people. But if you want -- if a interviewers [indecipherable] na -- ca -- talk about the camp. He has -- Socially, he keeps in touch with them, okay? But if you want to interview him or something, he will never talk about it. Q: Doesn™t that seem a little strange? SL: Even -- Even the same thing, if I mention something ba -- about a camp or something, he says, ﬁSol, shyer, don™t talk a bout it. I don™t want to hear about it, okay?ﬂ USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 57 Wouldn™t talk about it. And I told him, I sa ys, ﬁListen, open up, you™ll feel better.ﬂ And my next door neighbor, too. Q: Mm-hm. Here? SL: Yeah, my next door neighbor, he -- we -- from Auschwitz -- was in Auschwitz. And he also -- he didn™t want to talk about it. So I finally talked him in, when Spielberg was coming here, right? I talked him in about it. ﬁTake an interview.ﬂ ﬁNo, I can™t go through it.ﬂ I says, ﬁTry. I mean, you have to open up.ﬂ He agreed for interview, okay? RL: The son forced him. SL: Huh? RL: The son forced him. SL: No. He ag -- He agreed for interview, and he was a nervous wreck, the -- for the -- for weeks before they came, you have to see him, the guy was a nervous wreck. And they started, they opened up, right? Now, he couldn™t -- he couldn™t believe how much he feels better now. Now, you could talk about -- more about the camps than you could before. And his children are very happy, because now they got that biography what that man went through. Before, they didn™t know about it. They knew he was in camp, but didn™t talk about it. Q: It™s very important. SL: Yeah. Q: It™s very important. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 58 SL: You see, the thing is, you have to open up. Once you open up, it™s going to go out by itself. Q: Yeah, well it™s like that pressure valve you talked about earlier. SL: Yeah, it™s true. Q: I believe in it, I think that™s true for anybody who went through anything. But also, for his in particular, it™s important -- SL: Wha-What -- What do you think a si -- si -- si-psychologist, right? When you go -- sa -- mentally, something wrong, now. Someth ing is bad in back of your brain, your mind, right? And you ha -- keep it hidden. Now if they want you to keep on talking. [indecipherable] sessions you have, it™s all talking, right? Q: Yeah. SL: They want to see what™s bothering you. So when they hit a certain spot and you open up your valve, you let it out, you™ll feel better. They™ll be able how to -- be able to help you how to -- into -- handle it. Q: Yeah. True. SL: Now, if you keep in the mind, I don™t know how to -- what™s bothering you. Medication helps, but still, talking about it. Q: Yeah. Hm. SL: And that™s without education I learned it. I have a very good mind. I have a very -- I -- see, I™m -- I™m very challenging. If I made up to do something, I™ll do it. If I -- It™s USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 59 like I™m very good in repairing things, right? Even if I don™t know anything about it, I will not give up til I conquer it. Q: Mm. SL: Okay. Th -- It-It™ll b-be on my mind, could go weeks and months and I™ll conquer it. So there™s certain things -- I do all kind repair work, I do -- I can do anything, there isn™t a thing I cannot do. Q: But I -- I™m -- I™m assuming that this is one of the keys to your survival. RL: I think so. SL: The challenge -- The challenge. Q: [indecipherable] M: Strong Q: Very strong. SL: See, I like something -- I like something challenging. Once that challenge is not there no more -- Q: Yeah. SL: -- I ha -- I lose my interest in it. Q: Mm-hm. SL: But as long as the challenge is there, I -- I™ll keep on going. Like I had the -- I used to live -- where I u -- where I bought my first house. That was one of my challenges. Q: Where was that? USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 60 SL: In Brooklyn, all right? Had a leak, couldn™t find it. Now, the houses, there were seven houses attached, right? I went to the builder, he sent to point the bricks, he waterproofed the house, the leak was still there. And it bothered me, it was on my mind. One day it woke me at night -- most of my ideas come fra -- when I™m sleeping. Wakes me up in the middle of the night, it was on Saturday, so on Sunday morning, I got up Sunday morning, I went outside, I fixed my porch -- the li -- I fixed my next door neighbor™s porch, okay? My leak stopped. How did you come to the conclusion, right? I figured, when the building, it got steel girders, right? And it™s called a I beam. And what happened, the I beam ended up in my hou -- in the -- the two joints, th-th-the beams, right, ended on my house. So what happened, she had the leak on her porch and the water was coming in from her porch and running down the I beam, and the end of it was in my house, okay? So that™s where the wa ter was coming down. So once I fixed that porch, I™m fixed up. And that was the challe nge. No matter what I did to my pa -- my house, I di -- I couldn™t stop that leak, til I figured it out. If I would have been the ba -- if I would have been when they were building the houses there, I would have known it. But I wasn™t there, so I figured out that that thing like -- thing like that. RL: Over here, too, you figured out what the leak -- he had a leak he figured out. SL: Who? RL: Here, too. SL: Oh yeah, here, too. Q: You had a leak here? USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 61 SL: Oh yeah. And the builder -- builders ca-came, he was going to do something -- sosomething else. I says, ﬁMark, no way,ﬂ I sa ys, ﬁwater doesn™t go up, it goes down.ﬂ He says, ﬁNo, you don™t know what you™re talking about.ﬂ I says, ﬁYou don™t know what you™re talking about.ﬂ A-And then one days it was raining, I climbed up in the attic, I went and I went a -- and I went a -- and I look -- I was looking for that leak and sure enough, it start -- it was leaking onto -- it was coming from the top roof, going down, right? I got a hold of the builder. I brought him up, I said, ﬁHere where the leak is coming in.ﬂ He had to replace half of the roof. Now, he was going -- he -- he was going to fix the soffits. There™s openings underneath for the air circulation. He was going to seal this up. I -- I mean, water doesn™t go up, it goes down. And he come in -- That was a builder, mind you. And that™s a simple thing. Q: Yeah. So when -- So you di -- You were telling -- You told me that you -- How did you decide to put the ad in the paper in New York, to find your relative? Or somebody in France help you [indecipherable] SL: No, no, da -- no, no da -- th-the -- the one there, from the Red Cross -- the man that came from the Red Cross, he™s the one that asked if anybody has family in New York -- in America, period. And I told him yeah, I have cousins -- I mean, uncles and aunts and the whole family there. The Red Cross put in the ad in the paper, see? I didn™t put it in, they put it in, because I gave them the names, you know? And they put it into the paper and my cousin was looking through the paper, because of -- right after the war, in 1945, bif -- people that looking for family and she noticed my name there. She didn™t know it USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 62 was -- it wa-was a relation or not, but she wrote me the letter, you know. And then, in -- And then I gave her the right answers and it was my -- my mishpocheh. My family. Q: Mm-hm. So when did you actually come here? SL: 1947. April 15th. Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. SL: Took almost two years before I -- Q: Came by boat? SL: Yeah, Marine Flasher. Listen, those days it wasn™t easy to come to America, espe -- they had quotas. You couldn™t come in lik e -- like now. You had to wait. Because I came to -- and I came in the Polish quota. Lit huanian quota would have been longer yet. Q: Well, how did that work? Coming on the Polish quota? SL: Well, I -- I wa -- I told them I was born in Vilna. Vilna belonged to Poland, see? So -- So I came to the Polish quota, because in Lithuania, you had to wait til Lithuanian quo -- it wasn™t even open, the quota for Lithuania, those days, because there was not that many Jews left from Poland, so they -- they had the quota. Q: So this was a quota set up by the Americans? By the State Department? SL: Yeah, the State Department. RL: [indecipherable] SL: How many they let -- they only let in so many people -- nationalities, right? Q: Yeah. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 63 SL: So many from Poland, so many from th e -- from France, so many from Germany, whatever it was, right? The biggest quotas used to be st -- Irish, if you w -- if you know. If you [indecipherable] the Irish had the biggest quota. RL: [indecipherable] SL: The Jews had very little. I mean, I -- Q: Was there a distinction made between a Polish Jew and a Pole? RL: No. I don™t think so. Q: A Polish Christian, or it was just -- SL: No, they da -- Q: -- or it was just the nationality? SL: Well, no, they didn™t -- I -- I think they -- they had them in the priority to come in. Q: Mm-hm. SL: There was a -- I think there was. Listen, those days was very anti-Semitic. Q: Yeah. SL: Even -- Even during the war, I understand was it -- I understand there was so much anti-Semitism going on, the Germans against the Jews in ame -- in -- right then your -- in York -- RL: Yorkreel. SL: Yorkreel, right? In Westchester. Ever hear of Yorkreel, Westchester? Q: Mm-mm. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 64 SL: It™s a -- There wa -- Th-There was -- Used to be Germantown. There was so much anti-Semitism going on. The same thing is in -- in -- what e -- crayson manchenese. It was very racist over there, you know? Q: In New York? Manhattan? SL: Yeah, New York, yeah. Q: Yeah. SL: Nazis used to go out and demonstrat e against the Jews and nobody did anything about it. Q: Hm. So where did you go when you firs t got here? Who met you at the boat? SL: Oh well, I had my aunts and my uncles and my -- they -- they met me in the 46th Street, I think it was, West Side. We didn™t have to go to Ellis, and I [indecipherable] have to go to Ellis Island, see? Before, everybody used to come to Ellis Island. You didn™t have to go to Ellis Island. So we were -- I think in 46th and West Side hi -- West Side there. Q: Where did you get the money for the boat ride? Did they have to send it to you? SL: No, my da -- my uncle -- my aunt and my uncle paid. Q: Yeah. SL: I mean, they made out papers for me. Q: Right. SL: Cause -- And they made out papers for me and my -- my -- my father™s sister, my Aunt Bessie, she decided I™m going to stay berhow, cause the other ones -- one was in USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 65 Milwaukee, which I didn™t know much -- I didn™t know my Aunt Bessie, either, let™s face it. And -- And my un -- my uncles, I mean there -- they didn™t -- they di -- they didn™t make -- they decided my aunt was going to keep me, okay? So they -- they got -- they got together, my u -- my u -- my uncles and my aunts, they -- and they got the money together. I think it™s wa -- like 350 dolla rs that -- those days. And I was supposed to come on a -- on a fra -- on a big -- on a big boat. What happened that -- that boat, it burned down. So I came in a -- I™m a came in a armor troo -- armor transport. So that time the passage was like 180 dollars. Was a lot of money, 1947. Q: Yeah, yeah. SL: And I came and my aunts and my uncles, they greeted me, you know, they treated me very nice, but the thing was, you know, I was very inward. I didn™t trust anybody, sil -- like -- like an animal, you know? Y-Y-Y-Yes -- Y-You look out for yourself, survival. So it™s -- I didn™t -- I wasn™t trusting, I didn™t trust anybody, you know? And I was very inward. I didn™t talk about it, you know, it™s -- it was very hard in the beginning, you know, til about a couple of months, you know, then I -- I s -- I saw that the beautiful people -- my aunt treated me just like a mother, she rest in peace. My aunts -- My -- My aunts name and my mother™s name were the same names, you see? Wonderful woman. And I -- And I s -- Q: Now, you -- this aunt, was she your father™s sister? SL: And my father™s -- my father™s sister, right. Q: Mm-hm. She was older or younger than him? USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 66 SL: She was older than. And -- Q: What wa -- And her -- it was Bessie? SL: Yeah. My mother was all -- my mother™s rest in was -- name, she rest in peace, was Bessie, my aunt, she rest in peace was Bessie. Both had the same names. And the children took me in very nice, you know, my -- my aunt™s children. She had -- She had a married daughter that just got married, she used to live with them, because after the war, you couldn™t get an apartment. And then she had another son that was two years younger than me. And they were -- we lived very nice. Also my -- another uncle, my father™s brother lived downstairs where my aunt wa -- lived, you know the -- it was a three family house. Q: This was in Brooklyn? SL: Yeah. Q: You remember the address? SL: Yes. 365 Williams Avenue, it™s between Blake and Dumont, that™s in east New York. I tell you, was a beautiful life those days. They didn™t have much, but family was so close. I mean, they used to go on -- used to go on picnics every si -- Sunday, right? The whole family. It was the -- like the brot hers and sisters and the cousins, everybody. We used to go to the beach, we used to go to the park. Family was close t -- had a meaning of family. Not like now. Brother and sister don™t want to know from each other, right? Cousin -- The only time you meet a cousin, in a wedding and a funeral. Had one cousin and whenever I saw him, ﬁO h, we must get together, we must get USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 67 together.ﬂ And that I heard for 52 years. Now he passed away. I went to his house the first time, to -- to pay a shiva call, okay? That™s the way the family is. Before, was completely different. Was a nice, nice life. Q: When -- When do you -- What did you -- SL: Was a poor life, but was a good life. Now you have everything and the life is not like it used to. Everything ha -- Q: Pretty interesting, isn™t it? SL: Hm? Q: It™s interesting. SL: He had a interesting life. I mean, he was poor, all right? But you were happy, you were satisfied with everything you got, right? A child had a couple of toys, was a lot, right? And they played with it. Now, they got thousands of dollars worth of toys and they -- and they got nothing to do, I™m bored. I was born with one toy, I played with it. RL: One toy. SL: It™s true, that™s all. So, and tha -- and tha -- and that™s what life was all about. I™m -- I -- I remember I used to go to the movies, you know. Three of us used to -- used to go for a quarter, used to see two movies. Used to see a -- a cartoon and used to see the news. I learned -- I learned most of my English from the movies. Cause when I came to this country, and they didn™t have no -- the schools for refugees. You couldn™t go -- You couldn™t go to night school. Q: So what languages did you speak then? You spoke Yiddish? USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 68 SL: Yiddish. Q: Russian? SL: No, very little Russian. Q: Is Lithuanian a separate language? SL: A separate language, very hard to -- Q: You spoke that? SL: No. Q: No. SL: I didn™t want to know from it. It™s -- Beside s, see, when we lived, we used to go to cheder, then used to go to Yeshiva. And then if you got a little older, then you used to go to -- to -- to reg -- to regular school. See, because Lithuania was just like -- like in Israel. That™s all it too -- Hebrew -- Hebrew and Yiddish. And -- But I didn™t like the language anyway. So I didn™t like the people, I didn™t like the language. And I spoke French. Now I don™t remember it no more, but I didn™t have to spea -- I didn™t [indecipherable] to speak to French, didn™t use the [indecipherable]. Most of our speaking was Yiddish. That™s -- My aunts and my uncles all spoke Yiddish and that -- and little by little, I learned how to speak English. I didn™t go to night school, I wa -- I -- I didn™t have the chance. First of all, I went to work. So I didn™t have the -- I wanted to go to college. My ambition was to become a e ngineer. Never made it. Za -- Even in the army, I went -- I start to go to -- when I went in the army, I -- I went to school. I di -- went for my equivale -- equivale -- equivale ncy diploma, right? So I had to go at night USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 69 on my time, and -- and twice I had -- twice a week, the army gave you off hours on their time. And I won a -- I won a 5,000 dollar schol arship in 1953, for Harvard University, right? RL: He didn™t take it. SL: I fini -- I finished my -- I finished my course with distinction. But when I came out, you know, I didn™t have no parents. I came out, I couldn™t expect my -- my -- my aunt to support me, right? So I never took advantage of it. Q: Hm. Did she know about it? SL: Who? Q: Your aunt. SL: I never spoke about it. Q: You didn™t tell her? SL: No. Never spoke about it. RL: She treated him like a cha -- like a son. SL: But listen, they were poor people, they weren™t wealthy people. Q: Yeah. SL: Were hard working people. When I used to work and I used to give in -- I used to pay for the house, you know, for living? She took five dollars a -- a month and 10 dollars a month I used to give her. And then when I got married, all the money I gave her, she used to put away for me and when I got married, she gave me wup -- she gave USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 70 it to me back, okay? And very -- very poor pe ople, hard working people. She treated me just like a mother. Q: I want to take a break one second. Could I use your bathroom? SL: Okay. RL: Sure. End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B Q: This is an interview with Mr. Sol Lurie for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, November 30th, 1998, conducted by Steve Roland. This is tape two, side two. Okay. SL: Okay. Q: All right, today is November 30th, 1998, Steve Roland with Sol and R-Riya, right? RL: Right. Q: Lurie, in their home in Monroe, New Jers ey. It™s now about one 15, we™re starting -- this is the beginning of tape number two. Let™s see. Why don™t we start -- What -- Tell me a -- Tell me a little abo -- about your -- your -- you -- you -- we were talking about your life here in America. How long was it before you joined the army? How long did you live in -- in America? SL: I didn™t -- didn™t join. They called me -- They called me -- 1950 they called me, because the Korean War broke out and in nine -- and they called me to register for the draft, I registered for the draft. And then they -- they called me for -- to examination. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 71 No, first they deferred me, because I wasn™t a citizen yet, so they deferred me for two years. 1952, in -- in September, they calle d me back again. And -- And -- And they induct me in the army. I went for the physical and I was healthy and they took me into the army. So, I went in the army in October, 1952. Q: And what were you doing in the mean time, what were you doing in New York? SL: Well, I -- My first job when I came to America, I was working in a -- in a -- at my uncle -- my aunt got me a job working in the tie -- making ties, men™s ties, right? And I was getting that time, I was getting 35 cents an hour. Q: Now, what do you mean making the ties, were you like a -- sort of a tailor? SL: On -- On a sewing machine. Q: Yeah. SL: The guy taught me how to make ties -- how to sew and I learned how to -- how to sew and I was getting 35 cents an hour to ma ke the ties. Now, the regular operators were get -- were getting 36 cents a dozen. So after awhile, you know, I got -- I was doing a very good job and I told the guy, ﬁListen, I want to work piece work.ﬂ I says, ﬁbecause I ca -- I ca -- I can make four or five dozen ties an -- an hour, you know? So I can make a -- over a dollar an hour.ﬂ So he says to me, ﬁOh,ﬂ he says, ﬁa seksha noisgia green.ﬂ They told me in Yiddish. You-Y ou™re not no more a greenhorn, you know, not a foreigner no more. Now, you™re an American, you want the same thing as American. So I says to him, I said, ﬁListen, is my work as good as theirs?ﬂ He says, ﬁYes.ﬂ I says, ﬁI want the same type of pay. Why should I work for nu -- for th-the money that you pay USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 72 me, nothing, 35 cents an hou -- an hour.ﬂ And I told him, ﬁListen, if you don™t want to give it to me, I™m quitting.ﬂ So the end of the week, I quit my job. And I got myself another job in Jamaica, Queens, working on raincoats, also operator. And I was -- I was -- I used to do the -- part of the garment, you know. What I was making [indecipherable] I think was 40 dollars a week. Was good money I got after -- after 15 dollars a week. No, but this guy with the ties, had to come in Sunday, too. Was Sunday, I had to work a half a day. So the half a day used to be from nine to three. So when I wor -- went to work in the raincoats, I was making a little bit of money, that was in 1947, end of ‚47, and was better. And then I got another offer, this guy was -- all the f -- he was a subcontractor for -- he used to work for manufacturers, making dresses. And o -- so -- so I got an offer from this guy also , and that was in Brooklyn, on Essex Street. Essex and Atlantic Avenue. And I got an offer [indecipherable] says you™re going to teach me how to be a cutter -- fabric -- by dresses. So, I says, ﬁOh, fine,ﬂ right? Meanwhile, I was wavin -- I came in, I was working on -- on the -- on the -- on the ra -- mean operator. And then he took me into the cutting room and I was, you know, laying out the material bring on the table, and -- a nd -- to make the -- put the patterns on top of it and he showed me how to cut. And I was doing a little cutting, small things, not big things, because if that -- you don™t know what you™re doing, you destroy your whole -- your whole -- the whole -- they put up like 40 or 50 dresses at a time, you know. So -- And it™s -- actually, it™s layers of the fabric, then you put a patterns on top and you -- and you mark out the patterns on a piece of paper -- on a paper. And then you -- you roll USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 73 -- you pull the paper over -- over the fabric, and it™s a big table, a table maybe 40 - 50 feet long, you know. And then you -- you -- you -- you -- you -- it take ya -- ya -- ca -- the ma -- ma -- the cutting machine, just follow the pattern, just cut out, you know, for the -- the -- the patterns. Q: Yeah, but you™re cutting 40 layers? SL: Yeah, 40 layers, 50 layers, depends how thick it is, right? It™s very interesting. And one day I had an argument with my boss, be cause I™m very independent, right? I didn™t want nobody to take advantage of me, and I quit that job. So then I went to work in New York. See, what happ -- the thing is, I didn™t like to work inside. I didn™t want to be cooped up. Maybe because from the -- all the time I was in concentration camp, I didn™t like to be cooped up. I wanted to be always outside. So like -- like I felt -- like if -- if I have to run away, it™s open, I could run, see? Once you work inside, I mean, you feel like you™re locked in. There™s no place where to run. So I left that job and I we -- I went to work in New York. I we-went to work in -- for Regency Dress on Broadway. Think this was 1220 Broadway. And also dresses and I start to work in the -- in the carding room. I used to be like an assistant buyer. I used to -- n-not the big stuff, I used to buy like the buttons and the cotton and the threads and -- and also used to fix the -- the sewing machines. Because the boss saw I was very handy and -- and before he used to have a mechanic come in if a machine broke or thing like that, he -- he used to call a mechanic. I told him, I says, ﬁI could fix it for you.ﬂ He said, ﬁOkay.ﬂ And I was fixing it. He sa -- I saved him money. I also worked in the carding room, I used to be in the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 74 receiving department. Like the piecegoods used to come in for the cutters. I used to take it in, you know, I had to ch -- I had to check if there™s no damages and see, I have a special machine onto it, that see there™s no damages. There is damages the material, I used to put like a -- a marker there. So this -- Wh-When the -- When you -- When you goes into the cutting room, and when the cu -- and when the cutter lays it out, he used to see the mark. So he knows it was a damage, so when he -- when they laid the pattern, he made sure that the -- the damage doesn™t fall into the pattern. If no -- If not, the whole -- the whole piece of material is no good. And I worked there for quite awhile. I worked very hard, I used to work Saturday. And I told him, I says, ﬁListen, I™m working hard, I™m entitled to a increase, you know?ﬂ I was getting that time, 75 dollars a week. I says, ﬁListen, I want a increase.ﬂ So there was two partners. So one the partners says to me, ﬁOh,ﬂ he says, ﬁyou™re not a -- you™re not a refugee no more, you want -- you want to make money.ﬂ I told him, ﬁYes, I want to make money.ﬂ So one the partners says, ﬁI™m going -- We™re going to give you a raise.ﬂ And the other partner says, ﬁNo, you™re not getting a raise.ﬂ I says, ﬁOkay, I™m -- I quit.ﬂ That™s it. And I quit that job, too. Q: And they were all -- Were all of these businesses owned by Jews? SL: Yeah, all Jews, yeah. Q: So was it -- Was that just sort of taken for granted that you would m-mainly be working within a Jewish community? SL: Because -- Listen, they used to take advantage on foreigners. Q: Yeah. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 75 SL: I mean, if I do the work, right -- Q: Right. SL: -- like everybody else, right? Q: Mm-hm. SL: I™m entitled to get the same pay. Q: Sure. SL: I didn™t let nobody take advantage of me. Q: Mm-hm. SL: If I want to give my -- my time to somebody, fine. But the -- people not going to take advantage of me. Q: So would you say that they were -- that in -- in some ways, that the American Jews were looking out for the refugees by giving them jobs, but in other ways, they were taking advantage? SL: Taking ad -- yeah, work a little cheaper. It™s -- It was always this way, and still this way. As long as they could take -- as long as you let yourself. Q: Mm-hm. SL: But I know what I could do and what I can™t do. Q: Yeah. SL: So -- So -- So one of the partners wanted to give me the raise and the other one didn™t, okay? So I quit. Next week they called me back, they™re going to give me the raise. I told them, I says, ﬁOnce I walk out, I don™t come back no more.ﬂ I felt very USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 76 independent, right? And I went to work -- I found myself a job, that was something I wanted, I wanted to be outside. So I found my self a job driving a -- a truck, right? And I go into this paint store and it™s in Lavonia Avenue, East New York, name is Shamus -- M. Shamus and Son Paints. And I walked in there and they asked me, do you know how to drive a truck? I says, ﬁSure.ﬂ I didn™t have no -- no s -- no chauffeur license. So he puts me on the truck, you know, and I drive it. ﬁOh,ﬂ he says, ﬁyou™re very good.ﬂ I -- He didn™t ask me to show hi -- to show hi m my license. So, ﬁWhen you want to start?ﬂ I says, ﬁNot tomorrow, the next day.ﬂ Meanwh ile, the next day, to a -- the next day, tomorrow, I went down to the motor vehicle and I got myself chauffeur license, right? And I were -- I s -- I s -- I liked the job, because I had my freedom. [indecipherable] and I -- and I liked it. The work was very hard, but very nice bosses. I worked for them for 21 years. But the thing is, I was promised part of the bi -- of the business. One of the bosses said, ﬁWhen I retire, I™m going to give you part of the business.ﬂ He never -- Matter of fact, they™re still in business, still got one of the stores in Essex Street. Q: Mm-hm. SL: And East Broadway, Manhattan. The one in Brooklyn got -- the area is gone a long time ago. And he says, ﬁI™m going to give you part of the business when I retire.ﬂ So I kis -- So I took for granted he™s going to keep his promise. I worked like a horse. I mean, has this paint delivered new construction and had to bring it up in to some if the area houses. The big apartment houses didn™t ha ve no elevators. And some of the paint jobs used to be two or three flights up. I used to carry it up. Also, you know, the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 77 painters -- you had to deliver to the houses, private painters. So no matter -- depends where they worked. And most of the hous es were walk-ups, they didn™t have no elevators, like in East New York and Brownsville. So it was plenty work, but I liked it. I was never afraid for work. Work never killed anybody, and -- Q: So you started this job before you went to the army and then you continued? SL: Not all, no. But that was in 1951 I got the job at Shamus, see? Now 1952 they called me in the army, so I told them, ﬁListen, I have to go in the army,ﬂ and that™s it. So from 19 -- October 1952 to September 1954, right? I was in the army. So I got my -- I got inta -- inducted in Camp Kilmo, New Je rsey and I took my basic training in Fort Dix, New Jersey, for 16 weeks. And bay -- After bay -- And finished our basic training, we got our orders. Now in that time, the -- the Korean War was on a full -- full blast and more -- I would say 99 percent of the people used to go right to -- to Korea. Me and two other guys just -- we got our orders, went to Germany. As a matter of fact, our -- our Staff Sergeant said, ﬁWhen I come out from the barracks,ﬂ he says, ﬁand when you see,ﬂ -- I could still see his face right now. He says, ﬁWhen I s -- When you see me, a big smile on my face when y -- I make your orders, you are all going to Korea.ﬂ That™s what he said, right? Big se -- big sergeant. And he came up, and he orders with a big smile on his face. I told you not -- 99 percent of the people went to Korea and my and two other guys, we got our orders going to Germany. After I spent so many years in Germany, I went back to my -- my ho -- my sweet place, where I had such beautiful dreams there, and beautiful memories. And I went to Germany, was in the -- let me see, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 78 I know I -- think in February I left for Germany. And I got assigned to the -- the bloody red one, that was the first division. And I got stationed -- they send me to the 26th regiment in Bramberg, Germany. That™s where I was stationed, that was right near the Czechoslovakian border, I think. And I spend there almost -- was 17 and a half months I spend there. We were always on alert, because that time the -- the -- that was the height of the Korean War and there was always -- don™t know when the Russians are going to attack you from the east and so we were al ways someone [indecipherable] who was on alert, 24 hours a day were on alert, because you didn™t know when the Russians were going to attack or not. And I mi -- I had -- I ma -- had a good time there, listen. I came back -- first I was in concentration camp in Germany, then ca -- I came back with pride and showed them that I outlived you and I™m back as an occupier, I occupy you people. Q: While you were there, beside the -- the pride that you felt, did you have what a -- I mean, did it bring up a lot of the memories? Was it -- Was there a difficult aspect of it? SL: No, they didn™t -- the memories didn™t bring back. Because in my mind, I felt so good because I survived you. That™s what -- That™s what my -- my -- my -- my -- my heart and my mind, everything, that™s what I was thinking. I survived you. I came back like a conqueror. Q: Yeah. SL: Not -- Not -- Not as a slave, as a conqueror. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 79 Q: See if you can explain something to me. You know, I™ve known about the Holocaust since I was a little boy, but o-only in stories and some friends of the family and from some books. I was born in 1955, so it was all -- SL: Yeah. Q: -- over by then. Now, when -- when -- when I talk to people about it, when I talk to people, when I had this hope to be able to work a little bit with the Holocaust Museum, when I hear the stories, it just seems co mpletely unimaginable that it actually took place. It seems -- I can™t comprehend human beings. I can™t comprehend -- and it seems that it happened a long time ago. Can you -- Can you describe for me what -- what it was like to -- to -- those first, say 10 years after the Holocaust and during this time period that you™re talking about, how people perceived what happe ned, and did people really understand what had taken place? SL: You mean the German people? Q: Everybody. In America, like say the Americans. SL: A lot -- Let me tell you, a lot of Americ ans didn™t even realize, they didn™t even know that that -- there was a Holocaust, okay? You talk to a lot of southerners, they didn™t remember the Holocaust. Didn™t know th e Holocaust existed. See, the part of Germany that I was in, there was no concentration camps there. Like this, I would have taken and shown it to them. Now -- And the th ing is, we -- the closest one was Dachau and Dachau -- and we couldn™t get the fellow to go because we were always on alert. So we didn™t get no -- to go, an-and mo-most of the hillbillies, they weren™t even interested USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 80 in things like that. So, even now, you talk to a lot of the Americans, they don™t know about Holocaust. Q: Mm-hm. SL: So it™s -- I don™t know. Q: What -- Did you have a -- I mean, it™s a hard -- it™s a hard question to ask, I mean, I - I can™t even find the right words for it, but I™m curious about your -- how you lived afterwards, with the knowledge that this thing had taken place? SL: Well, I™ll tell you, I blanked it out my mind. I didn™t even think about it. Because if you th -- if things like that continues on your mind, you™re going to go nuts. So certainly -- You just blanked it out your mind like it ne ver existed. Forget about it. I don™t know maybe ca -- I wa -- I was built in my -- my system like that, shouldn™t -- I shouldn™t go nuts or crazy. I just blanked it out. I didn™t even think about things like that. The only thing I -- When I went back to Germany -- when I came there I felt like -- tall like a giant because I came back not as a slave but as a conqueror. Q: Did a German -- SL: An occupier. Q: Did the Germans know that you were Jewish? SL: Oh -- Oh, I used to advertise it. Q: How? SL: I advertise it. I used to say -- I to -- I told them, I was in your country, I wa -- and I used to show them my number. I have a number on my arm. They didn™t as -- a lot of USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 81 them didn™t even know what the number was. As a matter of fact, when was it -- two years, three years ago we were in Turkey, right? In Anatalia, and -- see, a lot of Germans come to Turkey. In Anatalia, there™s a lot of Germans and Jews, you know. So we were in the dining room and there -- the -- some German people were sitting in our table. And then we started talking, you know, and they say, ﬁWhere you from?ﬂ I says, ﬁI™m from America,ﬂ and where are you, ﬁI™m from Germany.ﬂ And after awhile I started to talk to them in German. So he says to me, ﬁWhere did you learn how to speak German?ﬂ ﬁOh,ﬂ I said, ﬁit™s a long story,ﬂ I says. ﬁMany years ago, I was a guest of your government -- I was invited by your governme nt as a guest,ﬂ I said, ﬁand I spent -- I spent four years in one of your concentration camps, you know.ﬂ ﬁOh,ﬂ he says, ﬁI didn™t know that there was concentration camps,ﬂ okay? I mean -- Q: He didn™t know? SL: -- they -- they still deny it, okay? I mean -- Q: And what was his reaction -- SL: Huh? Q: -- to your story? SL: Oh, and he was talking and next morni ng, we came for breakfast, he -- he wasn™t sitting no more on our table, okay? Before was very friendly and everything. And then we -- When they used to saw me walk down in -- in -- in the rest -- in the -- in the hotel, he used to -- he used to look -- walk away. So it still shows that a lot of th -- most of them I would say know about it, because now they teach them about it. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 82 Q: Yeah. SL: But there™s a lot of ci -- there™s a lot of these Germans in Turkey, cause the Turks go to work in Germany, if you know. And th ere™s al-also Israelis. There™s a lot of Israelis in Turkey. What™s -- What wa -- I was surprised when we came there, remember Ry? RL: [inaudible] SL: All the Israeli flags, wherever you go. Especially Anatalia, that™s the Turkish Riviera. Wherever you go, you see an Israeli flag. Q: Why? RL: Big hotel. SL: Why? Q: Yeah. SL: Because it™s -- Listen, it™s also be -- the Turks are very nice to the Jews. And also, you know, it™s business, because a lo -- a lot of Israelis go there -- go there for the vacation. Only takes an hour, an hour and a half, an hour and 40 minutes from Israel to Turkey, right? And -- And most you see, there is Israelis. Q: So tell me a little bit about your family. When did you meet your first wife? SL: Pardon? Q: When did you meet your wife, your first wife? SL: Well, I -- After the ar -- I came back from the army, was -- and I wa -- and I wa -- I came -- I came back on a Thursday, I got discharged. And I came into my -- my boss, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 83 Shamus, and I told him, ﬁListen, I™m back in the army, I want to go back to work.ﬂ And the law stated that if you were drafted in the army, you must get back your job. He says, ﬁOkay.ﬂ He says, ﬁCome back Monday and you can start working.ﬂ And I started to work in the -- back to the paint supply. And in 1970 -- 1956, a friend of mine introduced me to my first wife, she rest in peace. On a blind date, we went out to -- we were my friend and -- and I -- and his girlfriend and my future wife, went out on a blind date together. And that™s -- From that time on, I st arted to see my wife, I started to date, you know. Q: What was her name? SL: Her name was Evelyn. And -- Q: Evelyn what? SL: Evelyn Ba-Barkelle. Q: Mm-hm. SL: And we went about six months, seven months and we got engaged. And in 19 -- 1957 April, we got married. Q: Now where was she from, where was she born? SL: She was in p -- She was from p -- She was born in Poland. Q: Mm-hm. SL: But the -- During the -- In 1936 -- But during the war, their pa -- their parents ran from Poland and went to Russia. And they -- they spend the -- the war in Russia. And -- And after the war they -- they didn™t go back to Poland, because used to be a lot of USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 84 pogroms there and up against the Jews, right after the war. So they went to Germany and they spend the time in -- in a -- in a Displaced Person, a DP camp. That™s Dis-Displaced Person camp. And they were there til -- Now, my wife -- my wife™s father had a brother in America, so he -- he -- he got him -- he got him permission to come to America, in 1952, they came to America. Q: When you -- When you were dating girls at that time -- SL: Yeah. Q: Was it easier for you to date women who were also from Europe -- SL: No. Q: -- as opposed to an American Jew? SL: No, most of the -- most of my friends when I first came here, were all Americans. I never had no -- no -- no immigrants friends. Be cause, first of all, when I came, there were very few immigrants that came then. And most of my friends were Americans. Even all the girls I used to date were Americans. But, see, the thing is, I was -- I was raised and I was very respectful. I was taught to respect -- not like now, you know, everybody fists, you know. I was taught to respect a woman -- a girl. Don™t take advantage. That™s the way I was raised and that™s what I did, you know? And the American gir -- the American girls were a little too fast for me. I -- I couldn™t do it, right? RL: Can you believe it? USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 85 SL: They -- They wanted -- They wanted you should jump at them right away. I couldn™t do it. I went out with one girl, very wealthy, those days they used to live in Washington Heights. In the -- In the -- In the 50™s was one of the richest areas. You should know, right? Oh, well you don™t know anything. Q: You™re talking about upper Manhattan? SL: Yeah, Washington Heights. Q: Mm-hm, yeah. SL: And my -- And we went out together, you know, my cousin with another girl, he was all over her, all right? And me, I was respectful, you know? So she says to my cousin, ﬁWhat™s the matter with your cousin ? He doesn™t know anything about girls?ﬂ Right? ﬁHe™s afraid for a girl?ﬂ I said, ﬁNo,ﬂ I says, ﬁyou tell her, I have a lot of respect for a woman. I don™t like when anybody -- it keeps in your pants.ﬂ You know? That -- It wasn™t my type. I wasn™t raised that way. Q: Mm-hm. Yeah. SL: So -- But the European gi-girls were a little more -- much more respectful than the -- than the American girls. Q: But wa -- wa -- was there a clear distinction within the Jewish community here, between Jews that had been born in Americ a and Jews had -- who had just come over, who were immigrants? Was there -- Was there a difference? SL: N-Not -- Not -- I wouldn™t say. I wouldn™t say that. I didn™t think there was anything difference. I didn™t notice it, first of all. In the area where I lived, my -- most of USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 86 them were people that come over from the other side. I mean, there weren™t no -- no newcomers. And most of the people that lived over there came -- came before -- before the second World War. Some of them came in the -- in the 30™s, but most of -- most of them were foreigners. I would say 80 percent of the people were -- were -- were foreigners. They were American citizen, the children were born here, but they were -- they were foreigners. So it wasn™t that -- that -- that much -- I didn™t notice -- notice a difference between. Then -- But later on, like in the -- in the -- in the late -- in the 50™s, when I came back from the army already, there was a lot of refugees that the -- foreigners that came to -- to our area where I lived. So then I start to make new friends, you know. So I start -- Q: Was it ea -- Was it easier for you to make friends with refugees? SL: I mean, I always made friends. One thing, I never had no problem making friends. Q: Mm-hm. RL: It™s true. SL: No matter where I am. I™m very -- very -- I™m not ashamed to make friends. And -- But I -- I -- I don™t know if -- I felt more comfortable with the Americans. Q: Mm-hm. And when was your first child born? Tell me -- Tell me the names of your children. SL: Okay. I have three children. My oldest one is -- is Beatrice. My oth -- My second one is Esther and my son is Charles. I ha ve three kids. My daughter™s not married and USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 87 she has two children her own. And my other daughter is not married, she™s still single and my son is still going to college. He™s go -- He™s going for his Ph.D. Q: What are -- What are their ages now? SL: Beatrice is 39. Esther is 35 and Charles is 29. RL: 36. SL: 36 already? RL: Mm-hm. SL: Gee, time flies. 1960 -- yeah, 1962 - 36. Q: Now wha -- Ha -- Was -- Tell me about -- about your feelings when your daughter, your first daughter was born. Was there a -- in addition to the normal, or -- the normal pride in having a child -- SL: Right, yeah. Q: -- what -- were there things that -- that you think might have been different because of the amount of death that you had seen? SL: Well, ulti -- it was. See, my problem was -- the way I was -- where I was -- after concentration camp, I was -- I couldn™t show my feelings. In other words, I was -- I couldn™t show my love, because I was afraid that anybody you loved, like in -- during the war, you know, anybody you loved, you lost, okay? So I was afraid to show my love, even my -- my -- my first wife, she rest in peace. I wasn™t as affectionate as I should have been. And the same thing with my -- my -- my daughters, too. I wasn™t as affec -- as affectionate as I should have been. If I had to live my life over again, I would USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 88 be completely different. Because, in concentration camp, that™s what happened, you just lost your feeling of love. Q: So what was it like for you, the -- having children, a brand new beginning? SL: I wanted children. I did want the children, but the thing is, I didn™t spend it -- enough time with them. First of all, I was al ways busy working. My wife, she po -- rest in peace, never worked. Because see, in Europe, you™re taught the wife stays home, that™s way you were raised. And the -- And the husband does all the work. And so I was working and she stayed home rai -- th -- took care on the children -- child, first of all. And what it was -- it was very hard, you know. The closeness that I should have shown more. Now -- Now, I™m completely different. Q: Did -- Did this ever become someth ing that you and your wife talked about? SL: Well, my wife was also -- She was fro m the other side and they know -- she knew about it, you know? Q: So, it was left unsaid, do you think? SL: We used to talk about it, you know. Q: Mm-hm. End of Tape Two, Side B USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 89 Beginning Tape Three, Side A Q: This is an interview with Mr. Sol Lurie for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, November 30th, 1998, conducted by Stev e Roland. This is tape three, side one. So, it was left unsaid, do you think? SL: We used to talk about it, you know. Q: Mm-hm. SL: But, still you can -- you can -- you can™t change your feeling. Q: Yeah. SL: You just -- S-Something that™s in you, y-you cannot change. Was very hard. See, like now, you know, a parent, they sht -- they spend more time with the children. They are always -- li -- I see, like my daughter, too. Now, they spend -- the Sunday -- ki -- the kids have Saturday and Sunday, the weekend, they spend their time with the kids, because they™re both working. You know, that™s their time. And there™s more affection, there™s more love. I couldn™t -- I couldn™t sh -- I couldn™t show it, I couldn™t -- I hardly spent any time with the kids. I know I missed out a lot. Q: What was your -- What were your feelings towards religion and raising the -- raising the -- having a Jewish family? SL: Well, my wife, she rest in peace, she came from a very religious home. She was Sherma Shabbes, you know what Sherma Sha -- well, this is ver -- is very Orthodox. Now, she wouldn™t drive on -- on the Sabbath. She -- When I first met her, she wouldn™t USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 90 put on the lights. No -- No -- No -- No cooking [indecipherable] on the Sabbath. I mean, she didn™t do nothing. Q: Mm-hm. Kosher? SL: Strictly kosher, oh yeah. Q: Yeah. SL: Always kosher. We had two sets of dishes for pa -- for -- for ma -- for dairy and for meats. Also had, for Passover, you know, we ha d different dishes and my wife, she rest in peace, two months before Passover, she used to clean the house already. Ma-Make sure there™s no -- nothing left over from th e whole year for Passover. She was very observant. Q: Mm-hm. SL: And I respected it for her. I wasn™t religious, you see, listen what -- that was her belief and I did whatever -- whatever she wanted. Q: Did that create any problems, that you had different opinions? SL: No. RL: With work, with work, yes. SL: Only with work, see, because I wanted to go work on -- in the Sabbath and she wouldn™t let me, see? Had some good opportunities to -- to go wor -- the -- for business like, right? But that was involved the Sabbath. Q: Mm-hm. And that created some friction? USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 91 SL: Yeah, that created some friction. But lis ten, later on they -- had the three kids, you know, and then they had to go to -- to parochial school, because see, she wanted to teach them wi -- where the Jewish -- the Jewish religion, and they want to go to Yeshiva. And that, listen, it didn™t make e nough. So I told her, if you want to send to Yeshiva, I have to work. I mean, I can™t help it. And then, little by little, she -- I started to work on the Sabbath. Listen, you have to, you have to. Q: So what -- Now, just so I understand this, you were still working for the paint company? SL: Yes. Q: And then you were also -- became a -- a distributor of -- of cookies? SL: No, that was later on. Q: You were doing both at the same time? SL: No, no, no, no. Q: No. SL: Well I -- I worked for the paint company til 1960 -- ‚69, actually. ‚68, I™m sorry, ‚68. Listen, I saw one the bosses, he took in his son into -- into the business, right? And I says -- If I was promised a par -- a share in the business, right? And I don™t see nothing -- nothing moving in my way. I was making a good living there, but still -- I was making over 500 dollars a week, but if I was prom ised something, I want to -- I want to -- I want to get it if y -- its -- so I s -- I know there™s -- nothing™s going to work my way. I told him, ﬁListen, I got a an -- I got another offer from somebody I know, that --ﬂ He USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 92 had that cookie business, right? He was one of the supervisors there. He says, ﬁListen, there™s new -- new routes opening up, if you™re interested.ﬂ So I says, ﬁI™m very interested in that.ﬂ And -- But they weren™t paying much, because they started you with 150 dollars a week. And I had a family , you know? Here I was making over 500 and here I™m going down to 150. And I discussed it with my wife, I says, ﬁI have good -- a good opportunity to ge-get ahead, and I should take it.ﬂ She says, ﬁListen, you worked 21 -- 21 years by -- by Shamus and what did you get, nothing, right? Just promises. So I told them I™m quitting. And I left the job and I took the cookie business. That™s with Wachtel Biscuit Company. And, in about three months I got my own -- I was work for the company. Q: What™s the name of the company? SL: Wachtel. Q: How do you spell that? SL: W-a-c -- c-h-t-e-l. Okay. And after three months, I got my own route. But it was -- it was very hard work. And in the beginning it was -- and -- until you built up a good route. I used to wi -- I used to -- used to leave the house like five 30 in the morning, didn™t come home til nine at night. And little by little and I start to build the route up. And tho -- those days, if you -- if you di -- if you did like 2,000 -- two and a half thousand dollars a -- a week business, was a good business. But still, you know, we used - we used to work on 20 percent. But it wasn™t enough. So then they opened up -- and then the -- long hours. And I -- I had -- I had 135 stores to take care of. And when USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 93 you go into a store, you had to, you know, check the merchandise, the bo -- you had to take out the broken cookies, because they -- the -- the store gave you the space, and you had to take care of that. So I used to take out the broken coo-cookies, take out the shou -- you had to rotate the cookies, because new ones go in the back and the old ones go on top, you know? And it was a lot of work. Then they opened up a territory in the -- in the Bronx. So he asked me, because I used to have Manhattan and Westchester, he say if I want to go into the Bronx, it™s -- it™s a lousy area. I mean, that was -- you heard of po -- Fort Apache? Q: Mm-hm. SL: Okay. That™s the area that opened up. I says, ﬁI™ll go in, I™m not afraid.ﬂ I said, ﬁI got a -- I go -- I got a guy that™s watching me upstairs, I™m not -- I have no fear for nobody.ﬂ And I went into the Bronx and I -- I got some good stores there. From the 135 I gave up, I was left with 26 stores. What a pa -- I built up a business, I was doing 15,000 dollars a week. Q: Hm. SL: And I -- And most of my stores used to be dropoffs. Instead of parking out at stores, I used to drop off. And I built up a nice business. And from -- instead of five days, I™ll -- now, I cut it down to three days. And instead, for -- from the -- from six and then one, until nine at night, I used to be -- I used to -- I used to be finished by one o™clock. Ja -- The only thing was -- was just risky there. I only got held up once, which it wasn™t bad. Q: With a gun? USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 94 SL: Huh? Q: With a gun? SL: Yeah. RL: With a gun? SL: Well, th-the first one had a gun, yeah, he had a gun. I know he didn™t show it, but I knew he had a gun. That was -- You know the story with Gery -- RL: Getz. SL: Getz? Remember Getz? Q: Yeah. SL: Okay. Remember the guy that he shot in the subway? Q: Mm-hm. SL: That™s the guy that be -- that he shot in the subway, that™s one of them that held me up. That was 169th Street and Jerome Avenue. Boston Post Road, I™m sorry. Q: So I guess you approved of Getz? SL: Huh? Q: Did you approve of him? RL: He wanted to go to the -- SL: I was going to testify. Q: Mm-hm. SL: But what -- That time, I started to get the trouble with my heart. My wife, she rest in peace, wouldn™t let me go. So, what happened, you see, I was in the truck, unloading USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 95 my truck, you know, getting -- preparing the order take in the store. And this guy comes over to me and asks me what time is it. Was right in front of the store. I said, ﬁIt™s a quarter after 11.ﬂ And he walks away. Meanwhile, I get off the truck and I -- I put -- I put the merchandise on the hand truck and I tie up the -- the hand -- the -- you know, the -- the -- the -- the -- the merchandise on the hand truck to -- to the -- to the hand -- to -- with the rope. I had 21 cases in it. And I close the truck, and as I -- I ba -- you know, I -- I prepare to pull the hand truck up and on the curb, you know, backwards, had to pull it up, the guy grabbed me from the back, puts his hand in my pocket and ta -- and he took out the money and he ran away. And this guy that Getz -- Getz shot, comes over to me -- that™s was the first guy that came over and asked me what time it was, ﬁHow much did he take from you?ﬂ See? He had the gall to come over and ask me how much he took from me, okay? He was an accomplice. So I told him -- took 250, I told him 750. Go look for it, go fight with him. That time there was -- Q: He was asking you because he wanted to make sure he got his share? SL: Yeah, wants -- yeah. Q: Yeah. SL: I mean, the -- the -- the gall to ask me what time. I didn™t even ere -- and the thing is, you know, there was so many people in fr ont of the store. And nobody even bothered to come over. It happened so fast. Q: No, it™s a good thing you didn™t fight with him. SL: And I -- And I™ll tell you -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 96 Q: It™s not worth it. SL: -- I didn™t -- I didn™t make a big deal about it. Q: Yeah. SL: I went into the store, I unloaded my ha nd truck, I did my -- see, he should have waited, because if he would a waited, he got more money. Q: Yeah. SL: Because it was COD. So, that™s what the life was all about there. Q: And what -- what did you -- did you have to make a conscious decision about whether to talk to your children about your experiences, or was -- was -- SL: Well, the kid -- my children used to ask me, I didn™t want to talk about it. I just didn™t want to talk about my experience. It™s like I just wanted to put out my mind, just forget about it, like it never existed. Q: But did you think it was important for them to know that it had happened? SL: Is you -- Yeah, I thought it was important, but I just couldn™t open myself up to talk about it, because every time you want to talk about something, it brought back very bad memories. Q: Yeah. SL: Yeah. And then your minds just start to wander. So instead of the -- th-the -- like happened, things like that, just ignored it. Cause I in -- I understand why certain people don™t want to talk about it. Q: Why they don™t want to talk about it? USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 97 SL: They don™t want to talk about it. Q: Yeah, sure. SL: Don™t want -- They don™t want to let the -- the -- the worms out of the bag. Sees -- Q: Did you -- Did you -- Did anything different happen? I was just thinking about this and there™s just sort of a -- it ca-came in my mind. Did anything different happen when your children started to turn 11 or 12, about the same age that you were when you started the experiences? Did you look at them and think about yourself at the same age? SL: No, well, because the kids were spoiled. I -- Things that they wanted, they got, right? I used to think to myself, I says, ﬁBy their -- their age, I went through hell.ﬂ Even right now, I say the same thing. God forbid if something would happen, those children would never survive. Q: Yeah. SL: Never survive. Q: Well, what did -- How does that make you feel? Now you have grandchildren who are approaching that age and wa -- one that is almost, right? RL: Right, yeah. One is eight. Q: Right. SL: Listen, that™s the -- But they want -- they want be -- instead of things -- things that -- something that™s worthwhile. See, our gr anddaughter [indecipherable] be well, okay? She™s involved with cancer. RL: [indecipherable] a 10 year old. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 98 SL: 10 year old, she involved -- RL: Raises money. SL: She raises money for cancer, because he r -- her grandmother passed away of cancer. Q: Mm-hm. Your mother? RL: No. My mother too, but she didn™t know my mother. My mother died in Israel. SL: That™s from the -- the father™s side. Q: Oh, oh, oh, her -- yeah, mm-hm. RL: That™s paternal -- paternal grandmother. Q: Yeah. SL: So she™s involved with certain -- with -- with cancer. RL: Lot of money she raises. SL: And she raises a lot of money, okay? RL: A little girl, over a thousand dollars every year, all by herself. Q: Hm, wow. SL: Know, she has the -- she has the heart in the right place, see? Q: Yeah. SL: Which is important. Q: Yeah. But is it -- da -- is -- has it been difficult for you to have gone from so -- so many crises and so much -- so many hard experiences, to a life that™s easier? SL: You mean wa -- so -- You mean we -- what happened a -- I don™t understand. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 99 Q: I-It™s a funny question and it may -- may be it doesn™t make any sense. It™s just something that I thought that if you had be -- you had taught yourself to be a survivor and to survive not one or two experiences, but many horrible experiences, any one of which is worse than almost anything that almost anybody here goes through. I can™t ee - you know, when I read these stories, when I watch your videotape, you know -- I was in a car accident once. I was in one, really bad, horrible car accident that -- that was one of those accidents that I probably shouldn™t have survived. SL: Yeah. Q: And you look at the car and you say, ﬁBoy, nobody lived in that.ﬂ SL: Yeah. Yeah, your time is not up. Q: And is it -- And it was -- SL: You had to come and interview me, you can™t go. Q: Yeah. SL: Right? It™s -- I mean, it™s certain things. Q: Now -- And I was very aware of that and I was aware of a gift that I had been given. But even that one accident is not a comparison to anything -- any of the things that you went through. And now -- And th-then I look and I™m reading your story and watching you and I™m saying, ﬁGee, how -- how can so mebody go through all that and then -- and then it stops?ﬂ I mean, of course you want it to stop and of course you want and deserve to have a -- a -- a life, and a nice life. But is it -- is it difficult, the cau -- because you™ve seen so much? USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 100 SL: No, it™s not difficult. You know, because life was meant to go on, okay? If something happens, you shouldn™t say that™s the end of it and that™s it. Life was meant to go on, til your time is up, then it™ll -- going to stop. So don™t give up, see? That™s what I believe in. That™s -- Some people know, like you leave a -- lose a spouse, you know, some people just fall apart, right? Q: Mm-hm. SL: That™s the wrong way to do. Listen, you survived, it™s meant for you to survive, right? Life must go on. I don™t think your othe r spouse would want you to say that™s the end of you, give up, right? No. My wife should rest in peace, I mean, she knows it. While she was dying, she used to ask -- t-tell me, go call Riya, she lost her husband a year ba -- about a couple of months before, right? Go call Riya, her mother, she -- she rest in peace, was sick in Israel, dying from cancer and we used to go to support group, right? I should go call Riya and see if she wants to go out with us, or if she wants to go to -- to support group with us, right? Now, she and my wife -- I didn™t even know, they used to spend ours on the telephone together, okay? My wife, she rest in peace, was pushing me to her, I shouldn™t be alone. Q: Oh, that™s remarkable. SL: Hm? That™s was -- And shows that y-you can™t just give up life. Q: Yeah. SL: I got completely different outlook. I en joy life, now. I mean, you could see what -- life -- life is very short, so might as well make the best of it. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 101 RL: So he™s in a camp for grown-ups. This is a camp for grown-ups -- Q: Oh, th-this -- RL: -- this place. Q: -- development, uh-huh. SL: And -- Q: Are there a lot of activities with people -- with people -- RL: A million, a million. SL: Too much, too much. RL: It™s one big party a whole day, going on here. Q: Really? RL: Anything you want, you have here. Q: Hm. SL: She like -- like her -- her daughter™s father-in-law, is also -- he lost his wife to cancer, right? Q: Mm-hm. SL: That -- Very nice people, lovely woman. But the thing is, when she died, he was like a baby. He wouldn™t go in the house, used to sleep in the car, right? He™s like a lost -- a lost soul. Na -- Because they didn™t prepare themselves to -- to -- for a -- a thing like that. Me and my wife, she rest in peace, we went to support groups. Na -- You were expecting it, right? I mean, there were -- you -- that showed up, and a -- a lot of other people go through the same thing as you are. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 102 Q: Yeah. SL: You prepare yourself for the worst. I mean, you know there™s no -- there™s no hope. After she passed away, I went to -- I went to a -- also support group, for widow support group. RL: Widow [indecipherable] Q: Mm-hm. SL: I mean, everybody™s in the same -- in the same shoes. Q: Yeah. SL: So -- And also, in a wa -- helped me to s -- see aba -- in 1997, I had open heart surgery. Q: 1987. SL: Huh? Q: 1987? RL: ‚87. SL: ‚87. And my whole personality changed, my whole life changed. Q: Yeah, tell me about that, now was that -- was it instantly or was it kind of gradual, or -- RL: No, that was -- SL: No, it was instantly, right. Q: Yeah. SL: I was healthy, I used to work like a horse, right? USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 103 Q: Mm-hm. SL: Beside -- Besides that cookie business, had a repair business. But my repair business was as a hobby. I used to -- I loved to do it. And what happened, one day we came back from Florida, was president -- president weekend, we went to Florida. And I came back from Florida and there was some snow on the ground and I start to shovel a little of snow and I felt something, right? No pain or nothing, but it™s a certain discomfort, right? And my son says to me, ﬁWhat™s the matter, Dad, you don™t feel good?ﬂ I said, ﬁNo, Charles, I™m okay.ﬂ Maybe it shows on my face. And I went back to shovel snow. And -- ba -- bac -- ba -- couple of days later, I we -- I broke down with my truck, and I was walking to a gas station, and I had to climb up some steps and I got the same -- the same discomfort. I said, ﬁOh, something™s not right.ﬂ It™s the first time I admitted something, see? I never admitted something before. See, before that, I used to -- I used to smoke. And I used to have probl ems from the cigarettes because I used to be outside and my foot -- my left foot used to bother me. So I went to orthopedic man and he says, ﬁOh, you got a dro -- a dropped me tatarch -- metatarsal arch, that™s your problem.ﬂ So what happened, he taped it up. He says, ﬁThat™ll help you.ﬂ But instead of helping me, made it worse, because it cut the circulation altogether. So after five weeks, you know, I couldn™t walk on my foot no more. I went back to him, I said, ﬁI don™t know what it is.ﬂ He says, ﬁI™ll send you to a vascular man.ﬂ And when I went to a vascular man and when I walked in and l ooked on my leg -- he told me later, but he didn™t tell me ri -- he thought I was going to have to amputate it. There was no USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 104 circulation there. So the first thing he says to me, ﬁSol, do you smoke?ﬂ I says, ﬁYes.ﬂ He says, ﬁListen, if you want me to treat you, first thing you have to do is stop smoking. Because if you don™t give up cigarettes, I don™t want you as a patient, and I don™t need your money and don™t even bother coming back to me. I don™t need you.ﬂ Okay, that™s plain and simple. Q: That™s pretty good. SL: Okay? RL: Yeah, but wha -- SL: And I walked out, that was a Friday night, I says, ﬁBoy, he™s got some nerve to tell me not to stop s -- to stop smoking.ﬂ And I walk out and I go into the ki -- to a grocery store and I buy a carton of cigarettes, to spite him, okay? And next morning I got up, and like somebody said -- a -- a voice came into my head, ﬁSol, who do you fool? The doctor or yourself? The doctor is looking out for your health, right? Not for his health. If you -- If he -- If he wants you with your money, would tell you to come, smoke and come, all right?ﬂ I said, ﬁHe™s looking out for your health. Sto -- Stop smoking.ﬂ And that™s the last time I took a cigarette. I put a carton of cigarettes on my night table and I used to dare myself to take a cigarette. That carton of cigarettes was laying on my night table for a whole year. Never touched a cigarette since. Q: And you had smoked how many years? SL: I -- I haven™t smoked?

Then I went -- say -- said, after the stress test, you go home, you could eat and come back three hours later and we™ll give you the other test. RL: The [indecipherable] SL: So when I -- when I came back, they ga -- I came back three hours later and they gave me the tallium test and they saw something there. Because the dye -- Because the blood doesn™t go through, it lights up, it gets lighter. So he says, ﬁYou got something there.ﬂ I mean, he didn™t tell me, but they ga ve the report to the doctor, so when I came to the doctor for the visit, he says, ﬁThere™s something there, but we don™t know what it is, okay? But I would suggest you ja -- you go to a angiogram.ﬂ USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 108 RL: Angiogram. Q: Mm-hm.

He says, ﬁDo me a favor,ﬂ he says, ﬁthis is a very good friend of mine. See if you could see him earlier.ﬂ He says, ﬁOkay,ﬂ he says, ﬁyou know what? Send him down Wednesday, I™ll examine him.ﬂ So I came down Wednesday, he examin es me, he don™t find nothing there. He says, ﬁI™m going to set you up for a stress test,ﬂ I mean, ﬁangiogram.ﬂ Tha-That was for USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 109 the May first. And I came May first, they gave me the angiogram.

Because,ﬂ he says, ﬁI™m ta -- I™m going to try and see the angioplasty. But is -- you have to wait 11 days before.ﬂ I says, ﬁI™m not going to hang around the hospital.ﬂ I mean, just lay in the hospital and wait 11 days and what™s was -- an-and I don™t know what a angiogram was, never heard of it. Just [indecipherable] you could go nuts. RL: Angioplasty. SL: Huh? So, I says, ﬁI™ll come back in 11 days,ﬂ and I went to work, like a nut. I worked 11 days and I came back the 11th. A nd he told me right away, he says he doesn™t know if he™ll be able to go through, because I was born with my left artery has like a little bend there. It™s not straight, it™s a little bent. So he may have a problem getting through it. He says the right arteries also was clogged, but is -- that wouldn™t have no problem. So I came back 11 days and they worked on me for two hours -- two and a half hours. Tried to open it, couldn™t do it and I went in emergency surgery.

And agai -- and you got another chance in life, and make the best of it. Q: Some people -- I -- I -- I -- I think it™s not uncommon for survivors to not want to talk and at some point, they make a decision to talk, when they think maybe it™s time or maybe I better do it, maybe it™s important. I don™t have the sense, when you™re telling me this story, that this was a decision that you made, it just sort of happened. SL: No, no. Q: Or am I wrong? SL: Listen, I know so many -- I know so many people that -- from the concentration camp. I would say 80 percent and th ey don™t want talk about it. RL: They don™t want to hear about it. Q: Yeah.

RL: They become very emotional, very sensitive. They cry easily. Q: Di-Did you have a sense that you were close to death? That you ma -- that, you know, that it could have gone the other way and you could have died? SL: Well -- Oh, definitely. Listen, I told my wife -- I mean, when -- I said, ﬁListen, if something happens to me, I don™t want you to be alone, remarry.ﬂ I -- An-And listen, when you go this type of surgery, I -- Y-You didn -- You don™t know if you™re going to come out or not. Q: Yeah. SL: Now, it™s a little easier. Q: Yeah. SL: That was almost 12 years ago. Q: Mm-hm. SL: Was a different situation. So -- But it™s like even th-the -- my recovery was excellent, excellent. I mean, the doctors themself couldn™t believe it. That I went in -- I went in to surgery, was three 30 -- a quarter -- a quarter after six, I was out of surgery, right? By seven o™clock my wife was talki ng to me, [indecipherable] right? The doctors told her, ﬁHe doesn™t know what™s going on.ﬂ I opened my eyes, I™m shaking my head, okay?

SL: -- and they™re afraid if they open up, it™s going to start -- bring back very bad memories. Q: Yeah. SL: It™s like somebody with -- with somementa lly right? And also, to start talking about it. Before he -- he™s afraid he™s going to get int -- have a nervous breakdown. Q: Mm-hm. SL: So they figure if they don™t -- if they don™t open it up, they™ll feel a little better.

RL: She cried [indecipherable] SL: She says the first time, says she cried. RL: And I cried in the other room. SL: Mm. Listen, there™s s-so many things th at I got locked into my head, you know. I don™t want to talk about it. I mean, mo -- most -- most of the things, I talk about, but there™s certain things like your bod -- your mind just blocked it out. Q: Yeah. I was thinking about that during, you know, when I watched it. I mean, they asked me to talk to you about other things. SL: Yeah. Q: But if I wanted to talk about those things, I could -- there was a lot of things I could ask you about, but I didn™t -- you know, a few -- a few of them I -- in fact, really, there were a few specific things I wanted to ask you about. One was, she -- she asked you a question in the early part of the interview and you said that -- she asked you if you had been beaten while you were in the ghetto in Kovno, and you said no, you™d seen other people getting beaten, but you were never beaten until you got to Birkenau. SL: Birkenau, yeah. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 119 Q: Now, what -- But she didn™t ask you about the beating. Was that the time you got hit with the shovel, or was -- SL: Yeah, with the shovel. Q: -- oh, that was -- okay. SL: That™s my arm, here. Q: Mm-hm. SL: That™s the one I can™t straighten out. Q: Now, and what happened, the officer was mad at somebody else? SL: Well, we were walking -- we™re working on the railroad, you see, unloading. Q: Yeah. SL: And a guy [indecipherable] Hungarian Jews, Romanian? RL: Hungarian. SL: Hungarian Jews, yeah. And -- And they all -- They -- They just came into the concentration camp and they weren™t used to things like that, you know.

SL: And they used to put in rocks, or whatever, use -- you had to take it here and the other group used to take it back, right? Q: Mm-hm. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 120 SL: And what happened, we -- we loaded up -- they load -- they loaded our -- our thing up and you had to run, you couldn™t walk, you had to run with it, right? And he didn™t -- he didn™t move. So, because he didn™t move, we both got a beating. So I got hit with a rifle on my arm. RL: Shovel, you said. SL: Huh? RL: Shovel. SL: Shovel, shovel. Q: Mm-hm. SL: The shovel in the arm and -- and it broke, I didn™t even know. Q: Your arm broke. SL: My arm was broken. But I didn™t feel no pain or nothing. Q: Yeah. SL: And all those years, up til 19 -- 1987, right? It used to bother me, but my arm -- I figured maybe it™s arthritis. So it used -- it used to bother me and I never paid attention to it, because my arms just were la -- and then, when I had -- when I had my open heart surgery, I had a problem with my back. So I went to orthopedic man, and after -- and I was getting treatments, I told orthopedic man a bout my arm. He says, ﬁLet me take a xray,ﬂ right? He took an x-ray. He said, ﬁHere™s your problem, your arm was broken.ﬂ You could still see the break. And it healed, but the thing is, when yo -- after a certain time, it gets arthritic. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 121 Q: Yeah. SL: And that™s what happened. Q: Now there was another story that you -- you also said ri -- in about the same part of the interview, that you were only in one fight in your life, once. And she didn™t ask you about what that fight was. Was that a different story? SL: No, that was something else. The only dif -- When I was a kid, I had the fight. Q: Where was that, in the ghetto? SL: No, that was before the ghetto. Q: Even before? SL: Yeah. Q: What was that about? SL: L-Listen, like kids. Q: Just kids? SL: Yeah. A little fight, that was nothing. Q: Oh.

We never looked for fights, we never looked -- we were -- we were always play together, we used to go play soccer. RL: [indecipherable] show him your father™s grave. SL: Wha? RL: Your father™s grave. Q: Were there -- Were there any particular -- You talked -- You talked -- When we were having lunch, you talked about the guard who was kinder than the others. SL: Yeah, the German guard, yeah. Q: Yeah. SL: Well, we -- we -- he used to bring us his -- his fre -- his bra -- bra -- lunch, breakfast. When he was around, we didn™t have to work hard, you know, you used -- but when the one -- once they -- whether the -- the captain, you know, from the -- from the camp, because we wen -- we -- we went into another camp, was part of Birkenau, we were working at. And -- And the one -- once, there was a ca -- a captain there. And when we used to go with the guard and working on the farm there -- when there -- when USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 123 no -- nobody around, used to say, ﬁTake it easy, sit down, relax.ﬂ He used to give us this or this, a piece of bread. Whatever he had, he used to give us. But once the captain used to come, he used to turn. He used to tell us, said, ﬁListen, I don™t want to be that way, I can™t help it.ﬂ It™s his life or your life, you know? But then, he never beat anybody or anything like that. Q: Now were there -- were there other guards that you remember that were the opposite? SL: Oh, some of them. And some of them, listen, you -- you just look the wrong way, they kill you. But the -- This guy was -- mostly used to watch us. He was -- He was -- He was nice. Q: Was there any -- Was there any -- Did you have any knowledge of what happened to any of the guards, after the war? SL: No. Listen, if you -- they™re not going -- nobody™s going to treat them like they treated us. Q: Yeah. RL: [inaudible] SL: That™s not humane. Q: Yeah. Wh-What™s that picture? RL: This is his older bro -- hi -- the brother that was two y -- two years older than him, in front of the grave of the brother that got killed in Lithuania, and one is his father™s grave.

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 165 Q: And what was the purpose of that, because she would have gotten in trouble?

Think they going to get all the Jews together in one place, they get rid of them faster. RL: Mm. SL: I mean, it™s so tiny. What it -- The thing, listen is, there™s something there that you say, ﬁIf you don™t want me here, I could go over there.ﬂ Q: Mm-hm. SL: So, we have a place where to go. In the second World War, if there wouldn™t be -- be an Israel, a lot of Jews could have been saved, because they could have come into Israel.

You know what bother me in Saddam Hussein? They let him get away with it. And the thing is, he came to a point that he became a big hero be -- with the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 171 Arabs. Because they see, I™m not afraid to stand up to the Americans. But I say one thing. If you™d mean -- If somebody -- If you™re going to do something, do it and don™t - and don™t delay it. I mean, Bush made a big mistake for letting him get away with it. And now -- And th-this threat, you know, they -- this -- they say, ﬁHey, we™re going to do this and we™re going to do that.ﬂ And they don™t do nothing. You say it, do it.

The one that ge -- the one that gets hurt is the little guy.

You don™t pay nothing. The only thing you hope is on capital gain. Now, why is there capital gain? Because when you have money in the bank, or you buy securities, right, treasuries, they don™t pay much. So people going to the stock market. And the demand is ther e.

So he send -- So he -- The doctor send her to orthopedic man and the doctor said, ﬁYou got -- You got arthritis, that™s your problem, that™s why you can™t walk .ﬂ So she figured that™s the problem, you have to learn to live with it. Now, my wife always wanted -- she wanted to move to Florida. And also one -- During the time, you know, my wife™s personality changed a lot. I mean, her whole character changed. She became very, very hard to live with. And I figured maybe it™s the change of life or thing like that. And all the time, you know, she had problem with the -- with the -- with the stool. And that™s -- So we went -- we went to Florida and I bought a place over there, because she wanted it and I bought a place over there and we came back. That was in January of 1993. And we came back and USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 175 what happens? She went to the bathroom and like blood just gushed out, right, from the -- from the stool. So, she went to the doctor and told him. He says, ﬁWell, we™re going to get another colonostopy.ﬂ And they gave her a colonostopy and it came back they -- they mi -- they misread something on -- on -- on the -- she had a -- she had a tha -- she had a polyp in the rectum, they said it was a pol -- they didn™t look in the rectum, they went right into the colon. And the polyp was right behind the -- the -- the -- the -- the pa -- the -- the hemorrhoids. And by that time, in 1993, by that time, the cancer was in the bones already, and it went to the liver. So the doctor said, see if we could do something about it. And we got a -- we got a wonderful doctor and she called him up and told him, and he saw she was very distraughted, you know, very upset. This Dr. Cohen, here™s a guy, he didn™t have no office hours. And -- And that day he said -- he said, ﬁBut you come into the office, I™ll see you.ﬂ Okay? A nd we went to -- So he opened up the office specially. We went to him in Long Beach a nd he examined her and took tests. And he says, ﬁYou got the cancer in the -- it™s in the liver, it™s also on the lungs.ﬂ Because he was going to operate on her. He says, ﬁBut in Sloan-Kettering, they have a -- they -- they have a new method, that they -- they give chemotherapy. They implant radiation right into the liver. So instead of the fa -- this did not give you the -- the -- give the che -- chemotherapy all over your body, it just works in that area, you know, so it doesn™t affect the rest of the body. So my wife, sh e wen -- sh -- Evelyn went to Sloan-Kettering and had the surgery to put the implant radia tion and when he opened her up, he said -- told us, he said, ﬁThe body -- cancer spread all through her body, nothing you could do USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 176 for her. If she live three months, it™ll be a miracle.ﬂ He said if she would have come like two years before, she could have been c -- she could have been cured. The type of cancer she had is the easiest cancer to cure. Because they took out part of her colon, ri -- an-and the tumor didn™t even penetrate the wall, was just in the colon, the easiest cancer. And -- And they didn™t -- They just closed her up and they were giving her chemotherapy. And the -- the doctor said if she lived three months, it™ll be a miracle. And she made up her mind she™s going to b eat the cancer. And whatever there was a little sl -- little hope, she went. RL: Yeah. SL: She was ca -- from one doctor to the other. She was getting ther -- chemotherapy. And then the pain got bad so she was getting morphine. They started her up at five milligrams of morphine. And she wanted to go to Florida, I says, ﬁOkay, let™s go to Florida.ﬂ Went to Florida, she was getting chemotherapy there and wh-when the five milligrams of morphine went up to 350 milligrams of morphine. And that didn™t help no more. It came to a point, you know, that sh -- she sa -- she said, ﬁI want to go to the hospital.ﬂ S-So we went to the hospital -- no, she went -- she went to another doctor before -- just before that, went Sloan-Kettering and she says to him, ﬁIs there any hope?ﬂ He says, ﬁListen, you want to hear the truth?ﬂ I mean, she was -- she gets -- used to get sores and blisters all over her mouth, she couldn™t swallow. When -- They came from the -- right, from the chemotherapy and the radiation. RL: [indecipherable] USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 177 SL: He says, ﬁYou want to hear the truth? Could you take it?ﬂ She says, ﬁYes.ﬂ He said, ﬁWell, there™s nothing more we could do fo r you.ﬂ And we went home and there gra -- she says, ﬁYou know, Sol, I don™t want to live no more. That™s it.ﬂ And then the -- the pain got so severe, that even the 350 milligrams of morphine -- she used to get a patch -- didn™t help no more. So I too -- I took her to the hospital and she was getting more morphine there and five days later, she died. She died in my ma -- she was waiting for me. I had to go, because in the hospital, they didn™t have the patches for the chemotherapy. So I had to -- I had to go and get it. So I had to wait til the drugstore opened up, because I used to be in the hospital from seven o™clock in the morning, til 12 - one o™clock in the morning -- the morning. And when the -- So I went, waiting for a drugstore to open up, when I came back, th e doctor was there, trying to give her intravenous. She was like [indecipherable] pain. And when she saw me, you know, she - she opened up her eyes and put out her arms just like she was waiting like a Messiah came, okay? And she said, ﬁSol,ﬂ okay? And I came over to her and I told her, I says, ﬁI™m here, H-Hava.ﬂ I used to call her Ha-Hava. And I was there and she calmed down, was very relaxed. And then, about two o™clock, the doctors called me and he says that™s the end, there™s nothing more we can do for he r, that™s it. Because she made out a living will and he said, ﬁIt™s time to sign the living will,ﬂ you know? So I signed the living will. And they probably gave her some -- they gave her so much morphine that -- RL: They gave her morphine, put her to sleep [indecipherable] USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 178 SL: They kill her. She died in my arms. Yes. After that, listen, life has to go on. I was -- was a wasted life, but life had to go on. RL: It wasn™t a wasted life, she left three children. SL: Yeah. RL: It wasn™t a wasted life, she left you plenty. SL: Still, she could have lived longer, okay? RL: Wasn™t wasted. While she lived -- She lived a nice full life. SL: Yeah. Q: I think he meant to say -- SL: Yeah, but it™s not -- Q: -- if they hadn™t -- they made a mistake. RL: It was a -- It™s a shame that -- yeah. SL: It™s not, it™s the pain, the suffering. The suffering that she had to go through, that™s what -- I mean -- RL: That mistake cost her her life. Q: Yeah. RL: Because that cancer is so prevented -- I mean curable in the early stages, and she got it in early stages, she noticed it. SL: She went in plenty of time. RL: Yeah, the doctor said six months before, he could still help her -- SL: Hm. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 179 RL: -- the surgeon said. SL: What -- RL: She had a -- her oncologist, is a very nice man. We used to -- I used to -- I knew him personally, we would talk. I once talk ed about another friend with him, the chemotherapy and stuff. He was so good, such a good man. And he told -- And she was going to him and I didn™t know that. SL: Yeah, she [indecipherable] RL: And she told me she™s going to him, I says, ﬁHe™s a wonderful human being, so much heart in him.ﬂ And he™s good at what he ™s doing. And he refused to give her more chemotherapy, so she went to the partner -- SL: It™s a waste. RL: -- to poison her a little more. SL: The doctor, he didn™t want to give it to her. RL: No. SL: Cause he know there™s no hope. So the only thing -- She used to get these blisters, the whole mouth, the whole lips. RL: That™s from the chemotherapy. SL: The s -- throat, she couldn™t even swallow no water. Q: Yeah. RL: Yeah. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0031 180 SL: It -- It™s a shame, I™ll tell you something. Dr. Kevorky, they should give that man a medal. I™m telling you, because people suffer. RL: But Sol, she wanted, to live. SL: This way, the person don™t want to live no more, that™s it, forget about it. But whwhen you -- you used to -- when you went through things like that, then you know what suffering means. I mean, you could see the pe rson just being wasted away. The doctors don™t care, as long as they get -- make the money out of it. RL: Most of them do care, Sol. Oncologists do care. You get burned out in that, [indecipherable] very fast. Q: I would imagine. RL: Very fast. You can™t eve -- Q: What kind of a nurse did -- were you -- or are you? RL: Surgical. Q: Surgical nurse? SL: Listen, even -- RL: You get burned out -- SL: -- even belong -- we belong -- RL: [indecipherable] in surgical too. In all of them, you stay a -- most people, they rotate back and forth.
