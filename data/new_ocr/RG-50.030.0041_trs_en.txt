They're going to be very good to us. We're going to have a wonderful time, all of us. And uh right from there they put us in those cattle wagons; and they picked up other people on the way from other cities, and it was horrible. I'm still...I still don't like to go by trains. That was just... 6 Q: Can you describe it please? A: Was no...was no water, no windows. We were closed up. People were praying. People didn't know where to go to use the bathroom. They give us a bucket. And we were like little sardines put together. We didn't have place to move. I don't know if we were gone three days or four days. I don't remember. People...people were dying. Holding hands, and just holding...holding hands. And we came to Klettendor f--no, we came to [Guntebrecher (ph)] , to Germany; and I remember they let us out, like you know, when you sit so many days, when you stand and you can move.

A: I met uh...you know, when you go, when young people go together, you just start talking to each other, and you meet. And I knew all of them. But came people from other cities; and there were two ladies who knew my mother when she was a young girl. Their name was Kaufman (ph) . And uh I just met them, and I didn't know that they knew my mother; but I was just going to everybody, and I was just touching and thanking and introducing myself.

And I was dancing, and tap dancing. Q: What were the living conditions like in the camp? A: What conditions? We were existing, not even existing. We, the food - I remember I took a piece of bread, a tiny piece of bread, and I took it to a lady. And I said to her, "Cut in very thin...very thin slices." So I would have it for a long time. And uh later I, I got a better job. I mean they sent me to put boxes together. We called it Sentung (ph) , sending ammunition and things to other cities. And I had to put it together. And I was singing...I remember my father was singing German songs; and I knew a few, and I was singing. And there was one German 1 Forced labor camp near Breslau ( Pol: Wroc_aw). 7 who was...he said, "How do you know those songs?" I said, "Because my father was singing." And uh he like it so much he gave me a piece of bread. Q: Can you sing one of the songs for us? A: Oh, I can't sing, I can't sing. And uh later, I was sent out from this concentration camp to another one, to Klettendorf. In Klettendorf...let me think a minute. In Klettendorf, for me was a man's concentration camp and a woman's concentration camp. And in Klettendorf when it was, I...I became sick. I mean, I didn't have...I was malnutritious, and I was working very hard. And I was working, and uh I was a mechanic. I was supposed to be on mechanic. The German who had the place wanted me to repair a car. What do I know about a car? So he took a piece of iron and put it on my coat. He's going to kill. And was there another German who said, "________." You know, "Leave her alone. She doesn't know how to repair a car." So he said something to him in German. But he didn't do anything to me, because the other one was a soldier. So he...and I told this when I came home, you know, to...to the barracks, to my __________, to the lady who took us to take care of us. So she didn't let me go to work anymore the next day. She said that I am sick or something happened, she needs me there, you know. And they send me someplace else; because I was afraid if I go back to work I'm not going to come home alive.

We didn't have, we just had uh those things with ________, not really dresses, made like paper. No stockings, no shoes, just rags around our feet. And it was very cold, extremely cold. Oh, something burst into my mind. When I was in Klettendorf, I had prisoners of war...Russian prisoners. I remember once, and we just worked maybe ten or fifteen girls with some German who were taking care of us. And if they didn't see what you were doing, we...all the bread of...we didn't have nothing, but we sent all to the men. Because, I mean, we couldn't move without them. It was, it was horrible. And this, in same concen...in this same lager what I was, I met a guy...I met many guys, many Hollanders from Holland. But _____ to ______ to the arbeit lagers too; because they had Jewish professors in Holland, as they want to prod the students to boycott the Jewish professors, and they didn't want to. So for the punishment, they sent them to concen...to the lagers. And I met those guys, I met all of them. They were wonderful people. And one was Elias Kohn (ph), who's helping me out, who's helping everybody, who's wonderful, a wonderful hum an being. He risked his life to come...I mean, in this...in this Klettendorf he didn't have to do, but then he was sent to another concentration camp, to ammunition factory. He risked his life, and he came and he made a picture. He made many pictures. This was made in 1945, uh 1944, the eleventh month. I was working in ammunition factory. We, my whole body was grey-blue. And I scratched myself; and being hungry, not having what to sleep, not having what to eat, being, you know, missing everybody the way I did, I got very sick. We didn't have any doctors. We didn't have any nurses. But we had uh a lady who was married to a doctor, who was kind and took care 8 of me. He said for me to stay on the hot water, and when I felt...she took a razor blade because we didn't have any scalpels, and she cut me under my arm and she let the pus out and my whole body was.... And I was fainting; and she...somehow she took care of me. She said, she told me...I didn't know this because I didn't know then, but then I met her in 19...I mean, I met her ten or fifteen years ago in New York at a wedding. She was telling my husband that she was nursing with me with little spoons with water, because we didn't have much to eat. And everybody contribute. All the guys were very supportive, helping each other. You know, everybody give something away, they don't have much; and this helped me back to life. And I was screaming, "I have to be alive because I have to go home." I knew that I didn't have anybody, but I was hoping so hard that I believe in it. And when I come home, I'm going to have a mother and a father. And that's what I told everybody. And everybody agreed with me. Nobody disagreed, and everybody said, "Of course, you will." I mean, the doctors didn't have to do anything. They just talked to you and told you, and you believed them. Maybe this will help you. Q: How did this Dutch man help you? A: He was bringing, bringing food for us. He wa s telling us what was going on. He thinks even when you don't, didn't believe it, it was your only hope. You grabbed it.

I went to the camp, was 1943; and I was...I was two years in the camps together. But with the ghetto together, it was--the whole war, six years. You know, sometimes I sit and I don't believe it myself. But it's the truth. Q: Can you tell us more about the relationship between the young women together in the camp? A: We were very supportive of each other. I had four girl friends. These are Klara Kartush (ph) in Detroit, Tonya, Tonya...I forget her maiden name--Jablon (ph) . And Sara Stapler(ph). Those girls were wonderful. They even took care of me when I was very sick. Because they had a transport they sent out in 19...in 1945, before the war ended, they sent a transport of girls. I couldn't go because I was very sick. So they left me; and those girls didn't go. They said, "We're going to save you." I didn't want to ask. They said, "You have to lie down, because we're going...we're going close the whole lager." But what happened...the good thing happened that the Russians came the night before, and we were liberated the 8th of May. And they were supposed to kill us the 9th. Get rid of us. And you know, we were scared to tell them that we are sick because doesn't matter what. Right away, dead. (PAUSE) I remember I was standing and I was dreaming, I was pretending; I was looking at everything was so beautiful outside green, and we were cooped up. And people were going to work, and taking, and couldn't understand this. In the morning, we had to go to work. (PAUSE) We had to go and march, too. And they were clubbing us. They were hitting us. Some people 9 got, some people got...not hurt, but killed. Q: Were you yourself ever hit? A: Many times. One time I stole a potato. I was working in a garden. I saw a potato and I put in my arm.

And uh somebody brought me a letter from Poland, from my cousin, to come back home...to come home. "We're going to teach, you're going to go back to school." And I was very eager to do this. So three weeks later, I went back to Poland without papers, with nothing. I went back to Sosnowiec. Hoping, hoping that I have somebody there. Can you imagine, I was sitting in the train...I was sitting with a priest with some girls. And I remember I didn't have anywhere to put mine head, so I put on his knee; and when he started talking about the Jews, I picked up mine head and said, "I'm Jewish. And I'm ____________. I'm Jewish and I'm coming from concentration camp." And I said, "You better close your mouth, because you don't know what you're talking about." He got up...he throw me down, and he got up and went away. Coming back from...to Sosnowiec, I didn't have any money. I didn't have any baggage. I just had whatever I was wearing. Mine heart was pumping. I was overwhelmed. I was very happy; but I was excited and I was happy and I was scared and I didn't trust. I was afraid to trust. And I went back when my cousin wrote me the letter to the factory there. Was one of mine cousins and the people working. And he said to me, "This is yours. And stay with me, and we will take care of you." Didn't say anything about a school, what he wrote to me. And I stayed a week. I stayed two weeks. I was, I was going around. I was going to the place where we were living. They didn't allow me to come in. I mean, to me they didn't say this, but to some other Jewish girls they said _____________________________________. "You are still alive; they didn't get rid of you." And I told mine cousin that I'm going back to Germany. He didn't like it. One evening, I didn't say anything to him. I met another girl who came from concentration camp looking for her parents in another city--and twin cities, so it's another B_dzin. She didn't meet anybody. She was younger than I was. I mean, she was not quite sixteen and I was sixteen and a half. We went together, and just left. We went to the Polish grentz (ph -border ?). They didn't let us go. They let us go. We just ran through it. To the Czech, to the Czechoslovakia ______. She knew how to speak Czech; and she told them that I am...I don't hear and I can't speak. For two days like that.

It was...see, this was...my girlfriend was telling me. Gisza Klein (ph) was born in Odessa, but before the war they came to visit the grandmother and they couldn't go back. And what she told me when the Russians came, they opened the doors and she greet them. She said, "Strastvitye, tovarishi." [ Trans: "Hello, comrades."] She spoke Russian. And she says they came in. That's what she was telling. And I remember that I went looking for food for this little...we had many sick people. We went looking for food to the Germans, and they refused to give it to us. They gave us a few eggs and a little milk for the very sick people with, with uh, what they had uh something with a long - (tuberculosis). Tuberculosis. No doctors. Sick people. And I remember they got...they got a few of those Germans. Not I, because I don't have the strength to do anything cause I couldn't walk. My legs were like ________, I think.

He always give us hope, all the girls; and the girls took care of him after the war by helping him. Q: One of the Germans? A: One of the Germans, a German man. He was always decent to.... He had a big family; and he...when he came, he was...he didn't give us...he didn't have anything himself. But he give us hope. So we still have good people. I believe that we have good people. And I still trust people. And I promise myself one thing in concentration camp: when I'm going to be alive and I'm going to get through, the first _______ I'm going to grab I'm going to throw in the river. The first _____ I grabbed I hugged and I kissed and I give her all my clothes; and I give away my bread. You cannot do things like that when you're not brought up this way. It's instilled in you. Yes. Q: Can you tell us how you met your husband? A: I met my husband in Landsberg-am-Lech in July when I, when I came to Landsberg. I was liberated in June. I was in Poland for three weeks.

And she was born in Richmond; and when she was two and one half, not quite three, whenever I took her to the grocery store and she saw a lady, she asked her would she be my grandmother. You know, I didn't mind; but she remembers. My kids always asking, "Mama, why don't we have grandparents? Why don't we have uncles? Why don't we have cousins like other people have?" And I was trying to explain. I was sitting with them when they were a little bit older, sitting at a table and telling them. But I always broke down, and I start crying. I couldn't finish. Even now I cannot tell everything. But they don't ask too much, because they read and know and listen. Q: Is there anything else you would like to share with us? Any other memories that have come back as we've talked about any of your stories? A: It's going to come back to me later. Now I can't think, you know. Yes. Things like that should never happen. People should care about each other. 12 Q: Thank you very much. A: You're very welcome. Thank you.
