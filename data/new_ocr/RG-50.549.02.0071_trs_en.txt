Q: Great, yeah. A: The first time when I went shopping, I have to tell you, was a market. I was waiting for the guy to give me somethi ng, so whatever he gave it to me, I brought it back to him, I said, ﬁNo good, no good,ﬂ because -- so he said, ﬁYou pick up yourself.ﬂ And I couldn™t understand what he was telling me, so he took mine hand and said pi ck, and put it, there is, you know, and that™s how I learned.

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0071 55Q: No. Let me ask you about for the last 20 years or so, in this country, since the late 70™s, early 80™s, there™s been a lot of awareness here about the Holocaust, and me -- much more films, and -- A: Books.

A: Yes, they were telling us in the Jewish center, and I read some books, too. But I mean, I™m grateful for it, that they wrote, but you know, you have to feel it on your own self. What people who -- some -- people understa nd. Some people say never happen. I don™t fight with them. Fine. But a guy came to mine shop, and we were talking, and he said, because I have little things written down on ca rds, and hang up every place -- something from the Torah, something how you should, aw -- beautiful th ings. We talk, and he ask me, ﬁHow long are you in Amer ica?ﬂ I said, ﬁA few years.ﬂ I said, ﬁI™m longer than you are, and you speak better English than I do.ﬂ So an -- and you -- because you were lucky, you went to school here, you know, and I co uldn™t. I was deny -- we -- we were denying to go to school when we were young, too. So we were starting talking, and talking, and he ask me why -- I told him I came here after the war in 1949. He was a little bit older than I, and so he said to me, ﬁWhere were you?ﬂ So I said, ﬁI am a survivor from those USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0071 56death camps.ﬂ ﬁYou are really?ﬂ I said, ﬁYes, I™m really.ﬂ And my husband has, you know -- Q: A number.

A: On a little things -- no, a little something hanging, you know. Q: Uh-huh, but you didn™t have it -- A: Later, they took it away from me because -- Q: You didn™t have a tattoo? A: No, not a tattoo. Well, we™re talking and talking, and he looked at me, said, ﬁIs it really true?ﬂ You know, I said, ﬁI had a mother, and a father and a brother, and a family, and uncles, and aunts, and friends, and teachers. It™s true.ﬂ He looked at me, he said, ﬁBecause people were telling me, and I didn™t believe them.ﬂ I said, ﬁWhy not?ﬂ ﬁBecause they were pushing it on me.ﬂ I said, ﬁThey didn™t push it on you, they were maybe [indecipherable] I would think, but it™s true.ﬂ He said, ﬁYou know, I believe you.ﬂ I said, ﬁOkay, thank you.ﬂ And then he -- ﬁI wish I would have -- I would tell you that it never happened, but it did happen.ﬂ He ki ssed me, and he thanked me, and he went. Q: This was just a man that came into your store? A: Yeah. Now he comes in from time to time. That™s okay. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0071 57Q: But in these years -- in these last 20 years, a lot of survivors have been getting together? In groups? A: No, no, it™s -- no-not -- not -- not here in Richmond, because many passed away, and a few are -- we talk to each other from time to time. We went to weddings of the children, to -- to 50 wedding anniversary, and it™s nice, but you know, everybody has a life, and they are busy. But when we see each other we are very happy to see each other. But with some you make friends, with some -- like I vi -- like [indecipherable] Q: Have you been -- so you have not been active in any kind of survivor™s groups, or I know that -- you have? A: Yes, I was, yes I was. Q: And what -- A: But now I™m not too active, because I have -- I am active, I have to take care of myself, so -- Q: Yeah. What kinds of things did you do when you were active with those survivor™s groups? A: We -- we were getting together, we had lectures. Q: Lectures? A: Yes, and I had people coming from other cities, to meet with each one, speaking in University of Richmond, survivor. Q: Talking about? A: Talking about the same thing we are talking now.

And it™s -- for us it™s a little bit harder, because sometimes we have the children, the grandchildren, so you know. I was very active, and I was going da ncing with mine husband a few times a week. This was very important. Now I don™t. Q: No? A: I go to weddings, but -- so, this is the [inaudible] Q: So how -- how do you think th at being a survivor is -- is -- affected your life? I mean, it™s an obvious question, and I mean, it affects you in every way, every day. But how do you think -- what qualities do you think you have that maybe you -- people -- other people your age, who were born he re, for example, don™t have, or -- A: [inaudible] Q: It™s a big, big subject, but -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0071 59A: I-I don™t -- Q: Do you -- A: I am mys -- I don™t know, I™m myself.

A: Someti -- sometimes I coat -- when it -- sometimes I can be a little bit negative, and I said, ﬁUh-uh, remember. Do you remember?ﬂ You know what I™m talking about. Q: No, I don™t exactly. A: Okay. You know, remember we went throug h hell. We were in hell for so many years. So when something goes wrong, goes the other way, I say, oh, it™s going to be okay. I™m stronger than that. Remember what™s happened. Q: So you say -- A: And I™m extremely tolerant. Extremely. Q: And it™s something you™re aware of. A: Very aware of. To everybody. And it -- it -- do -- sometimes they come -- ga -- get -- with very intelligent peoples, I know a lot. And I don™t know, I li -- I™m not embarrass, I ask. I don™t know, could you explain to me?

A: About -- when they talk about something, and I really don™t know, I am not embarrassed to say I don™t know, please explai n to me. And people -- some people say, ha, ha, ha. Doesn™t matter to me. You go to college to get -- to -- how to get -- to get knowledge, yes? So if I don™t know, I ask somebody who knows. Q: Right. Have you -- do you feel the need to read books, and study things about World War two, and -- A: I read the books, I read the books. I don™t want to read anything about World War two. Q: No. A: I heard the -- I heard the last book my dau ghter got me was the great generation. I was reading, and I got very upset.

We were speaking in -- in -- in sch -- in -- oh, it™s not the way -- not far away from Richmond, it™s a college. Oh God. When you got a city of rich -- where is it? Not -- not here in Richmond. I have to ask mine husband, I do n™t know where it was. And people were speaking, I was just telling them the way I feel so very happy, what I told them. When I was speaking with -- Q: What did you tell them? A: I was speaking with young -- with young la dies who gonna be movie stars, who going to dramatic school, and I said, ﬁBoy, I want to go to school,ﬂ to dra -- I want to go to dramatic school very badly when I began here , but couldn™t do it. And now it™s too late. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0071 61Q: Maybe -- A: Oh su -- listen, you know how old I am? Q: You could be in the movie -- I don™t -- it doesn™t matter. A: Oh, thank you.

Something like that, it was so cute. Q: Yeah. But when you talk to young people, do you like to do that, or -- A: Ah, sometimes so -- Q: -- does it upset you? A: Yes, depends -- I can™t -- I don™t talk too much, I let them talk. They -- I ask a question, later I said finish with him please . As I say that, you know, because they ask me about -- they ask me so many questions. Like I told you, some things, I cannot go -- it doesn™t want to go through my mouth. Even now. Even now. Q: Yeah.

I™m sorry I didn™t prepare f-for it. Q: Sh -- A: That I™m her hero. Q: Oh. A: She™s so sweet. Q: So she wrote you a letter afte r she went through the museum?

A: I really don™t know what to tell you. Just be good, be kind. Listen to people. Don™t be condescending. Doesn™t matter if somebody did something, just listen, and try to be helpful. Cause everybody has a story. I have many. Q: You have said to me many times how -- ho w happy you are to be here in America. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0071 64A: Mm, very happy. Q: How many opportunities you™ve ha d as a result of coming here. A: Yes. Q: And -- but there must also be some things about this country, direct things happening here that are -- don™t make you happy, I™m guessing. We all have criticisms. A: I don™t criticize, that™s true, I don™t. But some things I don™t care for, but a ki -- th -- they changing. Q: Like what? A: But I ask -- I -- I couldn™t say things like that. I know it™s a lot of help, even for the children to go to camp, to he lp them in school, which I appreciate those things, because this is a very -- extremely important. And for the older people. We have to look up to the older people, doesn™t matter to whom. Which is true, isn™t it? Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. Have more respect. A: Have more res -- have a lot of respect. Doesn™t matter who it is. And with kindness we can do a lot, a lot good. I couldn™t criticize, I -- I [indecipherable]. I even didn™t think of it. Maybe some people would, I -- I -- I really -- you have to go to work, you lucky. I am lucky that I can do many things. I mean it. A nd -- and that™s -- something I can, I sit, and I can do it, I can. But many things maybe it™s -- people criticize. I just don™t know what to tell you, I -- Q: It™s not in you nature, I think. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0071 65A: It™s not in my nature. I never criticize my children, never. I criticize myself, but not the children. When something happen, I said lo ok at me. I cannot do this, and I cannot -- but you c -- you shouldn™t. You should tell them in a nice way, maybe, but not criticize. Q: Mm-hm, help them. A: Sure, it™s how you help. Maybe I remember this from the time I was little, I don™t know. Q: Your parents must have been that way. A: I was always told that I can do everything, and that I am special. And mine kids are special to me, every one. If they do something wrong, I just tell them in a nice way, you know, you have to change -- change someth ing. But no c -- I think -- I don™t like to criticize anybody, and I don™t like to blame anybody for nothing either. Q: Mm-hm. Do you and your husband -- you ™ve been married quite a long time now -- A: Just a few years. Q: Yeah, just a few. You have a very close relationship. A: Yes. Q: That™s -- A: Very close. This is my life. It™s like I told you, he™s more than a husband. Q: Yeah. You were very young when you first met him. A: Yes, mine professor, too. Q: Your professor. A: Yes, taught me everything. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0071 66Q: Was there a time when you first met him, or maybe some years later, when you both told each other everything that happened? Do you know everything -- A: Well -- Q: -- that happened to him, and does he know everything that happened -- A: Yes, yes. Q: Yes. A: Yes Q: You did? A: But we don™t talk about it. Q: Once, and that™s it. A: We talk about it, we don™t want it -- sometimes when he speaks -- when he speaks and I™m there, I start laughing to myself, and [ind ecipherable] people looked at me, because you know, I know all the -- and he -- he tol -- he was in Auschwitz. Q: Yeah. A: Yeah. He will tell you. And he was telling about his sister, and about his sister baby, and all those [indecipherable] about his father, but it™s so many years, you know. Sometimes I just remind him of -- talk about it. Now we are busy with the children, and the grandchildren. Q: Yeah, yeah, it™s behind you. A: Yes. Q: It is behind you? USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0071 67A: No. Q: No. A: No. And -- and some new -- it was so nice last night, we were called, a baby was born. It™s not mine cousin, it™s mine husband -- so me cousin had -- her adopted daughter, but you can imagine -- they are so happy. And th ey told me please call si -- ca-call up your children. So I said to my husband, ﬁIsn™t it wonderful to have a family?ﬂ Because we really didn™t have anybody when we are ca - when we came here. Ver -- wu -- we were -- we had the people we met here, from Poland, from Germany, from other countries. But I remember when I bought this house, it™s like, I ask my husband what should I do? He said you should take candles, sa lt, and bread. So I said, why. Candles to light so you would always have light. Bread so you w ould -- would never be hungry, but I don™t remember what -- why the salt. This I don™t even remember. I don™t remember. See, I ask him because I -- I didn™t know. He was a little older than I am, so he knows more. But I™m trying to learn, still. Q: Given the fact that it™s so difficult for you to talk about those things that happened to you, why did you want to do these interviews, and how -- you did an interview with the Holocaust Museum -- A: Because it -- yes. Q: -- and I could see when I watched that video interview, the pain that you had, just even when those thoughts crossed your mind. You don™t even have to say them, it™s clear. Well why -- why do you do these interviews now? USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0071 68A: I think it™s important. I think we all have to speak. See, I just can™t -- I would love to say something, I just can™t. I -- everything is engrave in mine heart, but I just can™t -- I -- I just can™t. I just want to tell you I saw too much, too much. I hope nobody any place will see it. And sometimes this is mine testimony, okay, for the people who were slaughter, and perished. So maybe I can speak -- I c -- I cannot speak for them, I know I cannot. But maybe a few words. I just hope that the history will never repeat such self. And nobody will be prosecute -- prosecute fro m any reason, for any reason. Q: I remember in your interview, you -- very early in the interview, you mentioned a fe -- a fellow named Marek Lieberman, was his name, Marek? A: Marek Lieberman. He was mine friend. Q: And -- and you -- A: Yeah, was -- Q: -- very early in the interview you said, ﬁI want people to remember him.ﬂ A: Oh, Marek Lieberman, I want the people to remem -- yes.

And -- and one of the people that you mentioned in your video inte rview was a fellow named Marek USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0071 69Lieberman.
