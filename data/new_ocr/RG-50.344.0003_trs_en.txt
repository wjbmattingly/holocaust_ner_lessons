Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 3 July 14, 1995 into nurses training. But the way the nurses training came about was that my father tuned pianos -- Q: Before you tell me this, I want to -- hang on one second. A: One of his jobs was at Brooklyn State Hospital. In those days they had big state hospitals. Q: Okay. A: So, my father talked to the -- well, when he went to Brooklyn State, he always went in to see the superintendent and -- and then they would let him know where he was to go. So he knew the superintendent quite well, so he told him about his daughter, who was having trouble finding a job. But eventually, you know, I was working. Just doing file clerk work. And so the superintendent says, ﬁWell, we have a nurses training school here. Why don™t you have your daughter come and enter our class?ﬂ And that was around October, November. So my father came home and told me that and I said, ﬁWell, I™m sure the classes started in September and I would be two months later and I™d never be able to catch up.ﬂ So he -- so my father says, ﬁWell, I pass by King™s County Hospital when I go to Brooklyn State,ﬂ cause he went on the subway. And so I wrote to -- to King™s County and applied and they sent me a ll the applications and whatnot. Now, they took classes twice a year and their next class was the first of February. So I was accepted and -- and then where I was working -- I worked right up until the last day and left and went into nurses training. Q: Mm-hm. Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 4 July 14, 1995 A: And just by happenstance, I really picked one of the best schools in New York. In it™s day, it was very, very fine. And I had a friend that went to Bellevue and there was just no comparison. We were treated like young ladies and we were expected to be young ladies. And at Bellevue it was helter-skelter, come as you go and just -- really, you had to be tough to go there. So I -- it worked out very well for me. Q: And when did you finish your training? A: Well, that was a three year training course. I mean, they practically don™t have those any more. But when I graduated -- I had always wanted to go into public health. We had two months of public health experience as part of our nurses training and I liked it. And so I went to the Brooklyn Visiting Nurse Association and applied for a position. And she said, ﬁYou have to have one term of college.ﬂ So then I went to New York University and wen -- went to night school. And I finally got my 16 college points and -- and I worked for them almost a year. But then people were going into the army and I had patients -- my sickest patients would say to me, ﬁWhat are you taking care of me for? You should be taking care of the boys.ﬂ Q: Really? A: I had that time and time again. So I have a very close friend, and she also wanted to go, so we went in together, and -- Q: When was that? A: That was very vivid in my mind, the first of July, 1943. I still remember that first day. Q: What was it like? What happened? Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 5 July 14, 1995 A: Oh, it was a day like this, hot as anything and her brother took us to the -- to get the train to go down to Wilmington, Delaware. And we were given very little instruction as to what to do. We got down to Delaware -- down to Wilmington and I think some -- it™s -- there were very brief letter and it said, ﬁYou go to Wilmington and you take the army bus to fort -- to Fort Dupont Delaware.ﬂ And we couldn™t find the bus. And there was no air conditioning in those days and we were rushing around from here to there and we were there almost all day. And we were so hot. I was exhausted. And we went to the travelers agency that is supposed to help travelers. They didn™t know a thing about Fort Dupont. And they were there really to help people in the service. Didn™t know anything about their bus service. Well finally, as I recall, somebody overheard us. Must have been a soldier and he said, oh yes, there was a bus around six o™clock at night, something like that and he told us where to go. So we ended up at Fort Dupont, we didn™t have any supper and we were just exhausted. And -- and the chief nurse just act as if we were arriving at eight o™clock in the morning and I thought she was going to put us on duty right away. But she finally let us go and showed us our rooms and -- and that led -- that was my first day of army experience and it wa s really, really -- it wasn™t very pleasant. Now I was just looking at Phyllis™s photographs. Now she was in big hospitals like Tilton General and England General and -- and I was very small. We only had seven nurses and four doctors. Very small place. Q: There at Fort Dupont? A: At Fort Dupont, Delaware. Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 6 July 14, 1995 Q: Mm-hm. A: Mm-hm. Q: How long were you there? A: I was there I think about a year and a half and then my friend and I were picked to go overseas and we joined this 131st evacuation hospital and -- Q: Where did you join them? A: Well, I tried to think. I™m not really -- we went -- I really don™t remember, really, how we formed, or whether we had to report. Someplace down in South Carolina, that™s where we left from. But it™s really very vague in my mind. Q: Were you on the ship then -- on the Queen Elizabeth, crossing with [indecipherable] A: Yes. We were all together, yes. And I re -- we were -- there were 40 of us and half were in one state room and half in anot her state room. And we had bunks up to the ceiling. And I had a bottom bunk and I really had to lie on the floor in order to get into that bunk. And then all night long, the ship would go this way and that way, so you™re either on your feet or on your head. But the reason was -- I don™t know if the other girls told you, but that we turned every seven minutes in order to avoid the submarines, because we did not have any escort across the ocean. So -- Q: Were you -- were you nervous? A: I don™t remember that I was. You know, when you™re young and it was like a -- an adventure, you know, and all these activities and whatnot you had never been exposed to Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 7 July 14, 1995 before. But we were very crowded, that I remember. It was very hard to find a place to sit down anywheres, you know, they -- we had about 10,000 troops on that ship. Q: Wow. And 40 nurses. A: Yeah, well, the nurses, we didn™t do anything. You know, we were just in a group, we weren™t performing any nursing -- Q: Right, right. A: Excuse me, any nursing functions. Q: Were you the only women on the ship? A: Yeah, as I remember we were the only women. Q: 40 women out of 10,000. A: Well, I™ll tell you, men were more respectful in those days. In fact, I remember when I was at Fort Dupont and two of the men -- two of the corpsmen were out in the hall and one of them used a -- a foul word -- Q: Watch your microphone, now. A: -- and he immediately came in and apologize d. You see, and that wouldn™t exist today, because the girls themselves use f -- terrible language. I hear it when I go to Brooklyn , right in the street, so I think women have really damaged themselves by trying to become -- meet the level of everybody else. So -- Q: Well, tell me what it was like in England. What did you do in England? A: Well, of course we landed in Greenock, Scotland and we had to climb over the side and get down into a trawler, because the Queen could only go in so far. And then -- and Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 8 July 14, 1995 we tramped, we had these heavy boots on and fatigues and we tramped to a train station and I can still remember that, the noise, you know, as we walked in the street. And everybody of course, I think everybody was probably nervous because we didn™t know what was going to happen. And we came to a train station and we got on the train -- and this is about two or three o™clock in the morn ing. And we rode for awhile and then we got off and then we tramped some more and then they said, ﬁThe girls will have this building and then the men will be here and the other men will be there.ﬂ And as we went down the street, everybody got a place to live and you went in and -- and there was a pile of blankets in the front hall and you grabbed a blanket and you just laid on it and mine was so greasy. I was awake all night, I couldn™t sleep. And that was the beginning of our adventure there. And -- see, we were supposed to go right into France and then changes were made. Something happened to the Americ an troops and so everything was changed. So then we didn™t do much of anything and fi nally we were assigned to local units. And I know I went to Wales and worked there. But I really don™t know how long I was there. Couple of weeks? Q: You were care -- you were there caring for [indecipherable] A: Yeah, we -- they were running ha -- actually American-run hospitals. And the one in Wales, the nurses lived in -- in these Neesan huts. And when you wanted to take a bath, you had to run out and well, quite a distance to go to the bathroom or to take your bath. And -- so you didn™t take a bath too often, but I know the nights when I got off duty, I had everything all ready and I just grabbed everything and then ran up to that place, Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 9 July 14, 1995 because if you didn™t get there first, somebody else did and you didn™t get any more hot water. So, I mean, even if you took a bath twice a week, at least you -- you got a good one when you -- if you got there first. So, I was there probably a couple weeks and I was o -- on a psychiatric ward, which, I never cared for that service, but anyhow -- and then eventually we were all recalled and then we went over into Europe proper. Q: All of you 40 together? A: Yes, all of us, yes. Except one nurse. She was married and before we went overseas, we had time off and she met her husband in Florida. We were all wondering what™s happened to her. You know, we lost sight of her. And she got pregnant in that short period. So by the time we got to England, she knew she was pregnant and they sent her right home. So we had 39. And we never -- and they told us, if anything happened, we would never -- nobody would be replaced. So we functioned just with the 39 then. Q: So you crossed the English channel and -- A: Mm-hm. Q: -- went to a -- A: Yeah, we did that in the middle of the night also. And they dropped these big gasoline -- I don™t know what they call them, they™re about as big as gasoline cans. And that went on all night -- Q: Depth charges. A: -- you just heard boom, boom, boom, because of the submarines. So, and then we landed in France. Gee, I™ve forgotten the name of the place. Le Havre -- Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 10 July 14, 1995 Q: Le Havre. A: Le Havre is where we -- and I™d never -- course I™d never been to Europe before and I wanted to see everything I could. And then they loaded us -- loaded us into trucks. Q: Do you remember what month this would have been? A: Um, we were not allowed to keep diaries and I had everything with me and we were told we must get rid of everything. And th at™s my -- and a lot of people -- not my -- I don™t know about my unit, but other people did keep diaries. I mean men. And -- so the dates are very vague to me. And I don™t know if -- Q: Was it warm, was it summer? Do you remember? A: Oh no, no. Q: Was it -- would have been the -- A: I remember now. Now I™m beginning to remember. When we were still in England, we landed two days before Christmas. Now it™s coming back to me. And when we were still back in the States, somebody, one of the girls said, ﬁWe™re going to land near Christmas, let™s get gifts for the men.ﬂ A nd I don™t know who that was, or a couple of them bought all little gifts and wrapped them all up. And we knew how many people there were and one of the men dressed up in Santa Claus -- this is after we were in England and -- and Bowden -- what™s the name? Three names -- anyhow -- and -- and Santa Claus went around and gave out the gifts and the men were really shook up because a lot of them are family people. And anyhow, that was our first Christmas. Just about two days before Christmas was when we landed there. Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 11 July 14, 1995 Q: That was Christmas of 1944? A: Yes. Q: Right. A: Yes. Q: So the Battle of the Bulge was going on? A: Mm-hm. Q: In -- on the continent. A: Which may be why we didn™t go into France directly, mm-hm. And -- but we really -- I mean all these things you hear about, all th e -- the Stars and Stripes, that newspaper. I never saw that paper. We never had any of this entertainment, you know, of the troops being entertained and -- we never had any of that. We were always very isolated. When we went into Europe proper, then we were living in tents and there were about six of us in each squad tent. So we did go over -- I would say February, March, somewheres around then. Q: Somebody else told me March. A: Yeah, it could have been March, mm-hm. Q: And you were transported then, through France? A: Well, we always drove in two and a half ton trucks and our unit was always together. And we had a colonel that was very considerate of the nurses. And he always had a party go ahead to wherever we were going to be and he had the trenches dug, you know, cause we -- and the tents put up so when the nurses arrived, they went right into their tents and Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 12 July 14, 1995 we had our latrines and everything set up. He always had that done first, he was a very considerate man. Which is sort of unusual, you know, especially when they™re doctors. But -- and then he loved to travel and eventually, when we were working at Gusen, Camp Gusen and we were near some of these -- now one of the girls mentioned this place and I™ve been there twice. And he knew about it cause he traveled a lot in Europe and wanted us to see that and I had two chances to go, because not everybody wanted to go, so -- Q: Let™s -- let™s go back a little bit before you got to Gusen. Was that -- that wasn™t the first place where you set up, you were set up in tents? A: Oh yeah, we were set up in quite a number of places, yes. Q: In the spring of ‚45. A: Mm-hm, yeah. Q: March, April, May -- A: Mm-hm. Q: Before the war. There was still fighting going on. A: Oh yes, April -- I mean, when we were in Germany, when the war was over -- no, before that, we were going to be overrun by the Germans. We all got a Battle Star for that and we were given instructions. That I remember vividly and the -- we were told, ﬁJust continue working as if nothing was happening. Do -- take care of your patients, do the same thing. And you may be que stioned, but just answer the questions, but don™t let it bother you,ﬂ and course we weren™t. But we were very close and you could hear these Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 13 July 14, 1995 great, big tanks coming. In fact, one day on my ward, one tank was so close and you could hear it coming, that even the bed pa tients got out of bed to see it. You know, you could hear this noise coming and I guess they were alarmed, because you didn™t know who it was, but they were Americans. And -- so we were very close, just at that one period. And that was someplace in Germany. And I couldn™t tell you where. Q: Mm-hm. A: And -- and then eventually we went into Austria. And that was when our unit left us for about a week or two weeks and the colonel said, ﬁWe™ll be back.ﬂ And one of the girls -- she was going with one of the men, th at she eventually married. And she started crying. I can remember Jeannie Albers, so upset. She says, ﬁWe™re never going to see them again.ﬂ Anyhow, they did come back when they said they would. And they got us. And then the colonel, in the morning said, you know, where he had us all standing -- this makes me very emotional. I can™t help it. Every time I tell this. He said, ﬁYou don™t have to go.ﬂ He said, ﬁThere™s a lot of tuberculosis and a lot of chronic illnesses and,ﬂ he said, ﬁyou don™t have to go if you don™t want to.ﬂ Well, everybody went except about three or four people. And when we came back the next day, everybody went. Q: Where was -- where were you when he told you this? A: That was at Gusen. Q: When you arrived there? A: Yeah. We were living in Linz. Well, it™s -- we had to go on duty the next day, as soon as they came and got us. Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 14 July 14, 1995 Q: Wait, let -- let me make sure this is clear. You went to Austria from Germany? A: Yes. Q: Right. A: Mm-hm. Q: And this would have been the end of April, early May? A: Maybe -- could be. Q: Now -- A: I™ve always been wanting to get my unit™s -- you know, they ha -- the -- each unit had to write up their experience and I™ve always been wanting to get a copy of that, because I don™t know about the dates. Q: Well, when did he tell you this? Before you got to Linz? A: Oh no, when we arrived at Linz. He then said he wanted the nurses lined up. You know, you lined up for everything and -- and we stood and -- and that was when he told us that -- that we did not have to go if we didn™t want to. Q: Did he tell you what you would see? A: I don™t remember. All I remember is that he said, ﬁThere™s a great deal of tuberculosis here,ﬂ which is quite infectious, and -- and whatever else he told us, that™s about all I remember of it. And maybe he told us we™d see a lot of things that -- that we -- you know, that would be very hard to accept, but I™m very vague on that. Q: Had you heard anything about concentration camps? Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 15 July 14, 1995 A: No, no I never had, no. And now see, some of the girls knew a lot of the officers, you know, and they may have learned things that way, but I never knew. I never had anything to do with them, I never bothered. And, we ll, like that one girl, they were keeping company, so I™m sure he must have talked to her about things. Now, what he heard, I don™t know. And so, that™s -- Q: Well, the next day then? A: Yeah, the next day, we went on duty right away, the next morning. And that was when he told us that. Q: And that was at Gusen? A: Yes, mm-hm. Q: And what was your responsibility? A: Well, I had a ward, big ward and there was a great deal of diarrhea and we were giving out sulfanilamide, which is -- I don™t think it™s a drug used any more, but it™s before the antibiotics came in. And, oh we gave out like 20 pills and everybody was up in tiers. In order to get up to the top person, you had to stand on the lower tiers to reach them. So -- Q: Was this a barracks that they were in? A: It was like a barracks, yes. Q: It wasn™t a hospital? Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 16 July 14, 1995 A: Well, we ca -- I think our hospital called it the hospital, because all these were the sickest people. And they were in -- lying in these tiers, these one, two, well at least three -- three up. So -- Q: Were those the barracks that they had been living in previously? A: That I really don™t know. That I don™t know. Q: But you would -- that became your ward then? A: That was -- Q: You cared for them every day? A: -- yes, mm-hm, mm-hm. And eventually we got these young German prisoners of war to help us as ward men. You know, to carry bedpans and urinals and -- and help, and we had very little to eat. We didn™t have much food and they -- our group went around thinking they could get food from the Germ an warehouses and they found they were empty. Everything had been used up, you know, because it was the end, and everybody was -- I guess the Germans were fleeing and -- and had used up what they could. And that was really -- I guess they ran out of -- must have ran out of supplies and whatnot. So -- Q: And what was the condition of the people when you first saw them? They were all -- were they all men that you were caring for? A: Yeah. They were all men where I was, yes. Q: And the first day you saw them, what -- what was their condition? What -- what were they -- Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 17 July 14, 1995 A: Well, they were lying in bed and they were weak and very thin. And I guess it was shocking, you know, when you™re not used to seeing all those types of things and people. Q: Were they clothed? A: Yeah, they had shirts on of some kind, mm-hm. And -- and pajamas, seems to me. Q: The striped? Did they have on the striped -- A: No, I don™t remember that, it just seems to me they had -- they had plain pajamas on. I don™t really remember exactly what they had on, but they -- they were covered. Q: Were they able to speak to you? A: Well, they didn™t speak English, but I can get by with a little German and so that was -- but I mean there really wasn™t too much to say either, you know, when you™re coming with the pills and they™re objecting and you™re saying, Si moosta dus taking, you know? Me with my German and English. So they -- they got the picture and -- and then they™d swallow them and so -- Q: Were you bathing them or -- A: No, we didn™t do anything like that, no. Q: Did other people do that for them? A: No. I don™t think so. Really, it just took you all day giving out the medication. So -- and whether -- Q: Why did that take so long? Why did it take -- A: Well, because we had so many people. Oh, I had a big ward. I don™t know, I had rooms and rooms with all these people on t -- in tiers, you know, three or four tiers going Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 18 July 14, 1995 up. In one room you had, boy, three, four, eight, 12 -- sic -- I bet you had about at least 20 people in one room. You know, all these like th ree and three. It™s sort of vague to me, though. Q: And they -- did you feed them, were they -- did you have food for them? A: Well, we had food. And that™s another thing. I don™t quite recall how we did that. We would have to have had trays, unless we had -- maybe there were tin dishes and we gave them the dishes, you know. That, again, is vague to me. I -- just how we did that. I don™t remember any more. Q: What kinds of precautions were you able to take to protect yourself from -- A: We really didn™t take any. Q: Nothing? A: No, we had fatigues on and that was all. We didn™t wear gowns or anything. Q: Other people have mentioned DDT spray. A: Oh, that™s another thing, yes. Before we went on duty, we had a gun that was about that long and they™d fill it with DDT and then it had a plunger and you held your thing out -- your suit open like this and some body would plunge it and plunge it down the back. And then your hair was all done -- we wore helmets. Q: It was powder, DDT powder? A: It was powder, yes. And -- and I don™t know, I had cancer of the breast and nobody ever asked me if I was exposed to DDT. And I often wonder if it had anything to do with Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 19 July 14, 1995 that. But then, there are an awful lot of women that have had the same thing that I have. So -- but we certainly was full of DTT. Q: Every day? A: Every day we did it. Tons of it. Nobody realized how dangerous it was. Q: You were probably grateful to have it? A: Yeah. Yeah, because they said there might be lice, you know and whatnot and so -- but I never caught anything. Q: Did anybody? A: I don™t think so. I was very sick when I was in England, but that™s before I ever had any contact with them. So, I think we were all quite healthy. Q: In the evenings, when you weren™t on duty, what -- what did you do? A: Well, all we had were these tents to sit in. We went on walks. Oh, that was in England, when I went on that walk. I don™t -- oh, I know, when we were in Germany, in one area, a whole group of us, including the men, decided to go on a walk and we did walk up on a hill. And there was a -- you could hear the cuckoo. You know, in Germany, the cuckoos sound like the cuckoo clock. Cuckoo, cuckoo. And I -- I was a birdwatcher and I says, ﬁOh, I™m dying to s ee that cuckoo.ﬂ So the whole group of us went up and climbed up that hill and we were walking around and looking and we could hear it -- cuckoo -- coming from different -- and all of a sudden, bullets started firing. See, it was a come on. And we got down from there very, very fast. And there was no mistaking who we were, because we had big Re d Crosses on all our tents. Our tents were Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 20 July 14, 1995 all down at the base. But you could hear the wi -- the bullets flying right overhead. You could hear them whistling. Never saw anybody. So -- Q: When you were at -- working every day at Gusen in Austria. D-Do you remember ever going out into the town there, seeing the local people at all? Did you [indecipherable] A: Well we lived -- we lived about 10 miles aw ay and they transported us back and forth by truck. And we did -- in the building I was -- we were in two houses and -- the nurses were and -- cause we were all bunched up together in the rooms and we had a -- a girl -- a German girl that took care of -- kept everyt hing clean and whatnot. And -- but we really didn™t converse very much with her, because most of the girls didn™t know any German and she didn™t know any English. But there was one girl in my group that wanted a tablecloth that she had fixed up nicely -- to decor -- you know, make everything look nicer. And she wanted that tablecloth and she said, you know, ﬁAsk her,ﬂ you know, ﬁif I can have the tablecloth of if she™ll sell it to me or what.ﬂ So I asked her. And she said, ﬁNo.ﬂ She says, ﬁMy husband gave me that a nd I don™t know where he is.ﬂ So -- I mean the sorrow was on their side also. So war is just awful. That™s why this Bosnia really bothers me -- what they™re doing there to people. Just awful. Q: Yeah. When -- how long did you stay there, working at Gusen? A: Well, we came home -- the war in Japan -- well, while we were still -- no, that was in Germany, when the war was over and Hitler killed himself and my friend Grace brought this radio with her. I think she was ready to throw it away many a time. And -- Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 21 July 14, 1995 you could never really get anything on it, cause we had so little ele-electricity, but she had it connected that night and we could hear the funeral music. And we said something has happened. But we found out later, you know, that Hitler had killed himself. And that was all -- you know, everything was garbled, you couldn™t get anything. We hardly had a light to see by. You know, one light and just enough electricity so you could find your way around, cause we had our own generators and they were very limited. But when we were in Gusen -- did somebody tell you about that terrible accident when we were crossing the river? We were talking about it earlier. We were -- every once in awhile you know, like the infantry or the armored group w ould find out that there were nurses in the area and then we would be invited over for a social evening. And we™d all went in a big group and we all came back together. And we were going to cross the river, the Danube and that™s a very fast flowing river. And -- and there were signs there. I™d been across it a couple of times and signs that said to the Jeeps, ﬁDo not start up your engines until the boat has docked.ﬂ And it was just a flat board, you know, boards. And we went over on a wire. And the wire hel -- was connected to the boat and that would guide it over, and then it would come back again. Otherwise the boat wa -- it wasn™t really a boat, it was a raft -- would be swept down the river. So we arrived this evening, we were -- quite a group of us, and -- for a social evening, some group acr oss the river. And the soldier that was there on duty was in a terrible state. And he said, ﬁThe most awful thing has happened,ﬂ he said, ﬁso there™ll be a little delay.ﬂ He said one of the Jeeps started up their engine and a nun had come along with her horse and carriag e and the horse bolted. It frightened him Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 22 July 14, 1995 so, that he just ran and of course there was nothing to stop him. Ended up in the river and she and the horse drowned. Now we were talking about that earlier today and they said they thought that the nun had some children in the -- orphans or something. I says, ﬁI don™t ever remember hearing that.ﬂ But I know then -- and they finally found her and the horse. The horse, they let him just go, he was already gone. But she was drowned. The water is so -- was so swift there. So little things like that happened, you know and tragedy. Didn™t have to. Q: Yeah. A: So. But it was the way they -- because all the bridges had been blown up, you see. In fact, when we crossed the bridge, one of the -- the Rhine, we came down a hill and we were in the truck, ca -- and we went across on pontoon -- a pontoon bridge. And I remember we were coming down the hill and one of the girls stood up and she started screaming. She thought we were going to go right into the water. But -- and the pontoon bridge, you know, the pontoons with something in between were just wide enough and the truck went across very carefully. So, that was an experience, too. Q: Do you ever remember having any sense of whether or not the local people knew that there was a concentration camp there? A: No, I really -- Q: [indecipherable] have any -- A: I really never mingled -- we really didn™t have that occasion and the only person was this maid that we had in our building and I don™t remember her name any more. She was Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 23 July 14, 1995 -- really is -- I remember a very nice person. And some of the girls said they asked her -- I never did -- and they said she didn™t know anything about it. But I mean, when things have come up like that, I said, ﬁIf terrible th ings go on in our prison, do we really know about it?ﬂ I said, ﬁLike the people living in Sing-Sing -- unless they know the guards who come home at night, how really are you going to find out about things?ﬂ So I -- I don™t really know that you can really blame somebody and said they must have known. But I mean, how do you really know unless you knew somebody that had something to do with it? Q: Well, in some cases, if there was a crematorium, there would be smoke and -- you know, thousands of people comi ng in and nobody coming out and -- A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But see, the town we lived in, they said was about 10 miles away. They told us, you know, we™d be -- apparently that was the only housing they could find and we had to -- we were driven those 10 miles going in the morning and 10 miles coming back in the evening. Q: Mm-hm. A: So -- Q: You didn™t have any -- A: Yeah. Q: -- sense of that? A: No. And there weren™t people living around us. I think they -- the German officers had lived in these houses and left in a hurry. Did you get that story from anybody? And they Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 24 July 14, 1995 left two dachshunds and we adopted one dachshund and we took him all the ways back to France when we were going home and then we had to stay in the -- these Lucky Strike -- did you hear about those? The different -- Q: Camps? A: Camps. And we stayed in Lucky Strike. And they wouldn™t let us take our dog in. And the fella said, ﬁNo animals allowed, but when you go home you can have him back.ﬂ And we never saw him again. Q: What was his name? A: Shloffin. It means he was sleepy. He was pr obably an older dog and he was such a nice dog. We have photographs of him. And when we were going back, we went back on the train and then we™d take turns, you know, when the dog had to wee-wee, to jump off the train. Well, the train would stop in the middle of woods -- wooded areas. We don™t know why it stopped, but it would stop. And sometimes we™d be there a half hour and sometimes 10 minutes. Well, I know when I jumped off with the dog, and he™s going from one tree to another as dogs do, all of a sudden the train started up. He didn™t stay very -- he must have been there five minut es and I™m running and I lifted up the dog and I can still remember all the hands and they took the dog and then s -- they grabbed me, because it was going faster and faster. So, I would still be there, I guess, if they hadn™t gotten me back on. Q: Well, do your re -- do you know how long were you in Gusen? How -- when -- when did you leave there? Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 25 July 14, 1995 A: No, I couldn™t tell you exactly how long, but I was home for August when the -- when the war was over, the Japanese war. I had just gotten home before that -- well our unit did. And we -- they gave us a month v acation and I was home during that period. Q: On leave? A: On leave. And then we reassembled and th at was August. So, I must have been there then, til the beginning of August, or maybe the end of July, so -- Q: And do you think you were at Gusen three, four weeks, something like that? A: Oh, at least. Q: Yeah. A: Oh, I think so, longer than that. And then the different nationalities were coming. And I can remember the French came to take all those prisoners that had been French or -- victims. And -- and the French were so ungr ateful. They were -- because they -- we hadn™t fed them and we hadn™t this and we hadn™t that. And -- and there wasn™t anything to do anything with. Q: Who -- which -- which -- who was ungrateful? A: They were the fr -- like the French Nationals. Q: Who were in the concentration camp? A: Oh, well people -- we had all nationalities there and the different representatives from those countries came and -- and then they™d go off with the whole group of say French speaking or Dutch people or -- there were other nationalities there, but I remember the French most vividly. Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 26 July 14, 1995 Q: And -- and who was not grateful? A: The French that came -- Q: That came. A: -- for their Nationals. Q: They thought that you should care for them? A: We should have done much better than we did. Q: For them? A: Yeah. For their Nationals. Q: Oh. A: That were in the concentration camp. Q: Did you treat everybody the same? A: Everybody was treated the same. In fact , you didn™t know who was who, one from the other. But -- but that was -- you know, when everything was winding down and these people were going home, back to their own countries. Q: In retrospect was it -- it was -- are you saying it was the best care you could give, but was it -- A: It wasn™t really the best, but it was the best in the circumstances. I don™t think anything more could have been done. And -- I mean, you could think of, when you run a hospital, what about the laundry service and what about this service and that service? And I guess it was all minimal. Probably ther e wasn™t any laundry service. But I can remember that they had sheets or like -- because as -- I think they had straw as mattresses Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 27 July 14, 1995 and it seems to me that it was like in a -- you know a bag, like a sleeping bag. You know, it would all be stuffed in there, otherwise it would be flying all over. And it seems to me that™s what they had and I don™t remember that it was especially soiled or anything. But I -- I -- you know, when you look back all those years and you don™t pay that much attention and it™s -- you don™t really recall all that. Q: Yeah [inaudible]. Hang on a second. This is the end of tape two, side A, Elizabeth Feldhusen. End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B Q: Okay, here we are. Hello, hello, hello, hello. When you were -- when you were in -- oh, I™m sorry, this is tape three, side B, Elizabeth Feldhusen. When you were in Austria and attending to the survivors at Gusen, I understand that there was also, nearby, the Mauthausen concentration camp? A: Yes, mm-hm. Q: Were there nurses caring for people there also? A: Not that I know of. I really don™t know of any other nurses that ever worked with concentration patients. I don™t -- Q: Americans -- A: I don™t know of any, no. Q: Huh. In -- Americans in Europe? A: Yes. Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 28 July 14, 1995 Q: Huh. I didn™t realize that. A: It would be interesting to find out if there were any others, but I never heard of any others and there may have been, but I don™t know of any, personally. Q: Mm-hm. When you would come back fro m your duty during the day, what would you all talk about at night? What was -- A: Oh my, that™s so many -- I guess we talk ed about our work. Because nurses tend to do that and so we probably did talk about what we saw and experiences during the day. Q: Do you remember it being hard for people to cope with or was it just your -- A: No, I really don™t. I don™t really -- and -- how did you find out about us having a get together? Not through this Jeannie Striker ? She™s down in Florida. Her name -- she™s married now, she has a different name. Q: Ho -- How is that out of 40 nurses, so many of you have kept in touch over 50 years? A: Mm-hm. Q: What was it about that experience that made you all be so bonded together? A: Well, I think one thing was that we had lived together so closely. The whole time we were in Europe, until we got to Linz, we lived in these squad tents and they were always five or six of us in a tent. And when we were in England we lived in one house and we had to fit into that house. There were always quite a number of us in each room. So, you grew to be very close. I think if we probably all had our own rooms -- and yet, in my nurses training we had our own rooms and my class is still very close. We still -- in fact I go to all my -- my King™s County luncheons. We have one in Pennsylvania and we have Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 29 July 14, 1995 one in New York City. I go to both of them. But most of the girls go to the one in Pennsylvania. So most of them have moved out of New York and live there in Pennsylvania. So -- but I think it™s the living closene -- and we all got along very well together. I really don™t know of any enmity between anybody. You know, ruffled feelings or anything. I think we™ve always gotten together. But I really -- I think I s -- have to pat myself on the back, because I think I started having us get together. And there was a -- in 1947, that was the big snowstorm and I had arranged for us to have luncheon down at a Candlelight restaurant in Brooklyn Heights, which was a lovely restaurant in a brownstone, and they gave you popovers -- the whol -- the whole dinner they kept coming out of the oven with these delicious popovers and -- and we had this get together and -- with the storm that we had, two people came down from Syracuse, Phyllis Law was one of them and Loreena, who passed away, was the other one. And Loreena says, ﬁI was so amazed to see all that snow, because Syracuse has the snow usually.ﬂ But they didn™t have it and we were just snowed in. And our chief nurse just couldn™t get there, she called me. She says, ﬁI can™t get the doors open.ﬂ Q: How many people were able to make that first reunion? A: I think we had about 10 -- 10 or 11. And I believe we were expecting about 20, because they would be the people from the New York area, but the two came from Syracuse. And -- but it was the big snowstorm. And then they said that we had a reunion a-at Hotel Saint George Thet. I said, ﬁI™m sure it was the Candlelight,ﬂ because I know the one was at the Candlelight and I almost think we had two at the Candlelight. And I Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 30 July 14, 1995 kept calling the woman and -- who owned the re staurant and she says, ﬁIt™s perfectly all right,ﬂ cause I thought we™d be charged for all those dinners. And she said no, it™s perfectly understandable, you know, when people can™t get in. Q: Sure, sure. A: And so every time I was cr -- every time I had a cancellation, I™d call her. Q: When you -- when you look back on your experience 50 years ago as a nurse and -- and during World War Two and especially that experience you had caring for the survivors of the concentration camp -- A: Mm-hm. Q: What is the lesson for you? Or, how do you think that changed your life in any way, or you as a person? A: Well, I mean I was talking to the other girls earlier. I don™t know if you were there, but I mean what™s going on in today™s world. I don™t think we™ve learned our lessons at all. And I -- at that time, I felt just like the United Nations. We would all be getting along together and create an understanding. I™ve been a member of the United Nations for quite a number of years and when I lived in New York, I went to a lot of their activities, but it seems worse to me than ever, which I can™t understand. Q: You were hopeful at the end of the war? A: I was very hopeful, yeah, that -- and -- but I mean, it™s all within the last 10 years that things have changed. And it™s -- to me it™s so hard to understand, when we can all get along together and be happy. It™s very disillusioning to me. And you would think after Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 31 July 14, 1995 that experience of the Holocaust that everything would have dramatically changed, but -- and now these skinheads that you read about. They™re -- they even have them in this country. I mean, nobody seems to appreciate wh at they have. And in this country you have more of the good life, than you have al-almost, you know, almost any place. And -- cause I™m very much against these people -- what is it? That rifle group? I think they all help to perpetuate these terrible things that are going on and I think things are going to get worse. Q: Well, how do you think that, having witnessed what you witnessed, what kind of an impact did that have on you as a person, after the war? A: Well, mm -- well, I think that -- you know , everybody said it can™t happen again, you know, it just can™t happen again. And you know, we had a chaplain and he gave us all the -- all these photographs. You probably saw them -- I don™t know whether you did or not. We all had a set of them. Horrible. But I mean, those photographs were -- I think were worse than anything I really saw. You know, the bodies and the pits and being buried and all this and that stuff. I think that we were sort of shielded from that and -- and really didn™t see as much as in those photographs. So, it™s hard to say. And I mean, I happen to be German and I have relatives over there. I have never talked to them about it. Well, they -- the younger ones, born way after, you know, they™re all about in their 30™s, but my cousin, she™s my second cousin, she™s a bout 65. I never ch -- brought it up to her, I never talked to her, cause I was sort of embarrassed and I didn™t know how to bring it up and so I never really said anything to her. And I had stayed with her parents once, when I Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 32 July 14, 1995 first went to Europe. I stayed with her parents for almost a week -- five or six days. And they never really talked about the war, but -- and -- and in thir -- and in ‚58, you know, it wasn™t too far behind and they had one chair in the house and I don™t know how that came up, whether I said something, what a nice chair it was or not, I don™t recall and he said, ﬁWe were all out,ﬂ he said, ﬁthe children were in school,ﬂ and he and his wife -- he was at work and his wife was off someplac e and when they came home, their house was just rubble. And he said, ﬁI pulled that chair from the rubble.ﬂ He said, ﬁIt was the only thing that was any good.ﬂ And that™s all that was ever said. I never said anything more, never brought it up. So, well I mean that™s no joke, either. But -- Q: What about since -- since that time? Ha ve you ever had a conversation with somebody where they tried to tell you that the Holocaust didn™t happen? A: Not really. It™s only what I have been reading in the paper. And I don -- really don™t know how they can believe that. I mean, when a ll the evidence is there. I -- I -- to me, I can™t see -- it just doesn™t match up at a ll. How can you deny something when you have all the evidence? The photographs and you can go over there and see it and everything else, I really -- I -- I -- I -- well, I think we just have a lot of crackpots or something or other. Just like those skinheads. They™re not all normal, they can™t be, to act the way they are and arousing all these anti feelings against people. Cause I grew up in New York where your friends are -- I had all kinds of -- I had black and white and Jewish and all and you just knew everybody and I -- a lot of my friends from childhood, I still keep up Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 33 July 14, 1995 with and it™s -- you accept people for the way they are. And maybe people growing up in smaller towns aren™t exposed to different types of people to that extent, and -- Q: Did you have Jewish friends growing up and in nursing school? A: Oh yeah. I have a friend in Lakewood , Lillian Sherr and -- and I always -- I say to Lillian, ﬁHow™d we ever get acquainted?ﬂ Because she™s about three or four years older than I am and she was working in the operating room. And we™re very good friends. Q: Do you ever remember her or anybody else saying something to you about the difficulties that the Jewish people were having in Europe before the war, do you -- were you conscious of that at all? A: No, no, no. Now Lillian went into the army a -- but she was in Burma. And she will not speak about her army experiences. And la tely I™ve been thinking about it. I wonder why -- because I always thought so many of my experiences were so interesting. But I once asked her about Burma. Sh -- a-and she™s different, you know. I should say -- I don™t want to -- she™d go like this, you know? She don™t want to. So I really don™t know what went on. She never talked about her army experiences. So it must have been a very unhappy experience for her, but -- Q: Yeah. A: I don™t think they ever had anything to do with the native people. And I would think going to Burma must have -- just to see the country, you know. Q: Mm-hm. This is the 50th anniversary this year, of the end of the war. Has that made you think about your experience more, or is it -- Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 34 July 14, 1995 A: No, my -- someone asked me, ﬁAren™t you going to go to some of these reunions over in Europe?ﬂ And I said, ﬁI have no desire to go.ﬂ And I don™t know of any -- I haven™t heard of anybody that I know that has gone, except one man I know. But he™s very active in military organizations and that, but otherwise I really don™t -- and I have no desire to go. I think maybe if a group of us had gone, that might have been something, but -- Q: Would you be interested, for example, in going back to Gusen or -- or go to li -- to Linz? A: Well, I™ve sort of wondered about it. I™ve been to Europe s-several times, but always with a group. When you™re on a tour, you can™t do what you want to do. But some of our people did go back and did -- I don™t think anybody in this group, you know, that™s here today, but I would say at least three people did go. And -- I™m trying to think who they were that did that. Woody might remember. Q: [inaudible] A: But I really don™t recall, but -- and I know one person said, ﬁWell, it seemed to be the same as it was when we were there.ﬂ And, but otherwise -- but I don™t have any burning desire to go. It was just a -- an unpleasant time of life and -- Q: That™s how you think about it, as something you™d rather forget? A: Yeah. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I believe so, it™s -- you know, and then sometimes I wonder why -- you know, rehashing everything. You know, what is the real outcome of that going to be? But I think the reason was so that it wouldn™t happen again. But -- but Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 35 July 14, 1995 when you think of what people do to people, what™s going on today, I don™t think it™s had any influence whatsoever. Q: Yeah. Anything I didn™t ask you about that you would like to talk about or tell me about or -- A: Well, no. It™s only that once in awhile something that™s said, you know, brings up another idea, but otherwise, just some funny incidences and I really -- I don™t think so. Q: Okay. A: I think we covered the highlights. Q: Okay, good. A: Unless you want to hear about my Germ an prisoner of war that helped us in Gusen? Q: Course. A: I don™t always tell it, because some peopl e don™t really think it™s -- anyhow, he was a very -- I don™t think he was more than 18 - 17 and he lost his meat can -- you know, that™s the -- it™s a two part dish -- I still have mine at home -- and you have your silverware on the inside and when you go to get something to eat, you open it up and you have two parts and they put the food in it. And then you wash it and put it together again. Well, he came on duty and he hung, I guess, a j acket and -- and his meat can on the back of a door -- happened to be a hook there. Well -- and then he came to me and he told me in German that his meat can was gone. And I said, ﬁAre you sure you left it there?ﬂ And, yeah. So I started looking under everybody™s pillow. And I™m climbing on all these tiers and looking under. I finally found it. My God, he was practically kneeling every time I Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 36 July 14, 1995 passed him. Cause he told me he™d be killed if he -- if it was found out that he lost it. Oh, he was so frightened, oh. Which is why I really worked very hard to find it. And I did find it. Oh, he was frantic. He was just a kid, you know. And we had German prisoners of war when I was at Fort Dupont and I had some funny experiences with them, too. Q: Before you went overseas? A: Before I went over. You know, we had 10,000 prisoners there at Fort Dupont and when we were on night duty, we worked from seven pm to seven am, 12 hours. And then you got an extra day off for that. You did that for two weeks. So the prisoners, when they -- when we were preparing for them, we had just a very small hospital with three wards and s -- and some private rooms. And th e prisoners of war were at least a mile away. We had quite a big hospital there, but it was empty. So they put their ward as far away as you could go. How I wished I had roller skates. Cause you had to go down there and gave out -- you put out the medicines. I put them in all little medicine glasses with the name of the person. Cause we had a ward man who was German. He gave out all the medicines, he did everything except the narco tics and the injections. So he called me one night, it was pouring rain and he said, ﬁWe™re being flooded down here.ﬂ And -- because I could understand him, you see? And so -- and -- and one of the duties of the night nurse was to run across an open ramp into the nur ses quarters and close all the windows. And we had these rainstorms that came up in Delaware in a second. And it just came down, you can™t imagine. And so I had just come back from the nurses quarters -- you ran into everybody™s room, closing windows -- and the telephone call came in. So I ran down Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 37 July 14, 1995 there and they had a guard and he had a whole ring, like this, of keys. And -- and he -- well, anyhow, I said, ﬁI got to find out what™s happening in here.ﬂ So I got in there and they had all the beds pulled to the center and the floor was wet. There were a couple of inches of water on the floors and everything, the bed linen was wet. I know I had to go back and get more bed linen, cause they didn™ t have enough, because they didn™t use that much, you know, at one time. And -- and they got me a chair -- oh, and we had bars on all the windows. Not regular bars, but screening, that metal screening, each one with a lock and they were not in succession. So I™m looking for the key, got that window open, opened it, they close it, we locked that again. Go to the next window. By then somebody moved the chair, I got up on the chair, got that window o -- closed -- and the next one. So finally I said, ﬁFor heavens sakes, will you find the right key? Go down while I™m working on this window and you get that lock for that window.ﬂ Well, and we had one window next to another, we must have ha d 40 windows on that ward. Well, I can tell you, about -- af -- seven o™clock in the morni ng I was down in the office of the man that was in charge of that. And he got a -- heard from me. I says, ﬁThere is absolutely no sense to what you people have done.ﬂ I said, ﬁFirst of all, you don™t need those metal screens on those windows, that™s asinine.ﬂ I said, ﬁAnd if they get out of the window, how are they going to go further?ﬂ Because there were big bars and sc -- that curly -- Q: Concertina wire? A: Yeah. I said, ﬁHow can anybody get over that?ﬂ And I said, ﬁAnd where are they going to go if they get out? There isn™t any place.ﬂ I said, ﬁThey can™t get any food, Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 38 July 14, 1995 nobody™ll have anything to do with them.ﬂ And the next night, they were all off. Everything was off those windows. That I remember vividly. Well, anyhow, while I was jumping from one chair to the other, one of them says, in German, he said, ﬁShe™s like the little old lady who lived in a shoe, she had so many children, she didn™t know what to do.ﬂ Well, I burst out laughing, I couldn™t help it. And I was supposed to be very stern, you see, they were our enemies. But I ju st couldn™t -- they were all young people, you know. I couldn™t help it. I was accused of being too friendly. I couldn™t help it. I was going with a fellow then and he said, ﬁThe word is that you™re too friendly.ﬂ I says, ﬁI can™t help it.ﬂ I said, ﬁThey™re nice young men.ﬂ Most of them were very young. And there was one fellow that had -- had -- I think he had his appendix out. And -- and they -- they get morphine, you know, every four hours if they need it. So I prepared, up at my place -- we kept the -- the morphine and those drugs, you know, they didn™t have them down there. So I went down with my syringe and -- course Hans, as I remember, had called me and said he was in terrible pain. So I went down and the poor fellow, when he saw me, the sweat started coming and he was in awful pain. He -- and he™s inching away back toward the wall. He saw me with the syringe and I remember Hans said, ﬁHe™s -- he thinks you™re going to kill him. Put him to sleep or something.ﬂ So I™m trying to tell him, you know, this is for -- to help him. See, they were so -- so -- I mean the tales that we heard on our side, they also heard against us. So anyhow -- so I finally got him -- gave it to him. He was almost fighting me, you know. And he was in terrible pain. It was probably gas. Interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen 39 July 14, 1995 Q: Yeah, yeah. A: So, we™re -- we had a -- a remedy that I used to use. What was it now? Something old fashioned that had two things and I got it from the pharmacy. And all they needed was a little sip of that and it brought the gas up and it worked miracles. Q: I think we™re done, Elizabeth. A: Yeah, okay. Q: Think so. This is the end of the interview with Elizabeth Feldhusen. This is tape three, side B.
