You know, you had to sing a song that the German ha -- hat -- the Hitler song, before every class. So it didn™t ev en bother me at that time, because it was a song. But when we finally were thrown out, more or less right out of school, my mother says -- decided that was for me to get -- time to get out of the -- Germany. Q: Uh-huh. A: It™s too bad that she didn™t have enough sense to -- to take herself out of there, too. They had a chance to go.

Jude, Jude, Jude, the name Jude was [indecipherable] how -- how are you, Jude, Jude, Jude, like a stinking Interview with G unter Haimann August 6, 2007 13dog. That™s about the size of it. So we -- so you -- the only thing wa-was, had to get -- had I -- ha -- I was thrown out of school at that time. Q: Who told you you couldn™t come back to school, the teachers? A: I think it must have been the -- the gymnasium [indecipherable] Q: The -- the teachers? A: Gi -- well, th-the gi -- the gymnasium [indecipherable] the one tha -- the -- the people who were in charge of that. They told us, out. And lot of the other schools, smaller schools were left -- left a little la ter, but that™s when -- when -- when I -- my mo -- my mother and father thought it was time to go. Q: Mm-hm. A: And let me just tell you one thing. My father did have a sister here in the United States, which were came -- which were -- came here in 1914, so she was already a -- a -- an American through and through. And she -- she thought it would be good for me to move. That™s -- that™s the beginning. Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. A: But what -- but my parents never thought that it would -- there would ever come to the -- to term that the -- that they would have to leave there, or that they would do anything wrong. And when I fina lly -- when I finally -- let me finish the story? Interview with G unter Haimann August 6, 2007 14Q: Well, now, I™m -- I -- A: There is something to that. There -- when I finally came to -- that my father and mother were go -- coming, they went to Stuttgart and Koblenz , which is the -- the -- the seat of an American consulate, to apply for a visa and a -- a permit. Now my par -- when people here send the -- the necessary papers , they were not official enough to allow a family of three more to make a living here. So the American government decided that this is not the pla -- they -- they -- they cannot, without help from somebody else in ge -- in America, make a living here. So on that basis, they tried other places, and a lot of my friends, their parents came over. And they could never come out, and they were sen -- then sent to Poland in the concentration camp, and killed. Q: Oh. How long did you stay in Germany after you couldn™t go to school, and before you left? A: I -- I think it was the -- within a month. Q: It was a matter of months? A: Yeah, it was already a matter -- a questio n to -- whether I should go or not go at that time. They knew that I had to go. Q: Yeah, but I meant you were out of school just for a few months before you left for the United States, is that what you™re saying? Interview with G unter Haimann August 6, 2007 15A: I™m -- I™m saying that the feeling that we have to get out was there. Q: Yes. A: So as soon as possible, I don™t remember exactly the time schedule -- Q: Okay. A: -- but she -- but they did the best th at they -- they had to make the ap-applications -- Q: Right. A: -- to the consulate in the -- in the u -- in the United States. And I had to go to -- for the -- to Stuttgart where there™s a counselor. And they gave me all the exexaminations and essay, and then they said you can go. Q: Yeah. So you went to school til about 1936 -- A: Right. Q: -- or early ™37 -- A: Correct. Q: -- okay. So what was your response at the age of 15 that you would have to leave your family? That™s a tremendous -- A: Excitement. Q: Excitement? Interview with G unter Haimann August 6, 2007 16A: Excitement. Yeah, I didn™t realize the -- the real danger, I was really -- I™m t-too young -- I was either too young or to o stupid. I couldn™t understand it that why -- why I go by myself. Q: But you weren™t frightened to leave your family? A: Pardon me? Q: Were you afraid to leave your family? A: No, not at all. I was not afraid. I-I-I was the kind of guy who lived -- I -- I used to go to bicycle riding for long distances. And I didn™t feel that way at all. Matter of fact, when I came to here in this count ry, they s -- were surprised how easily I got along with the boys playing soccer, right in the middle of the -- 78th Street, where we lived. Q: So you were -- you would describe yourself as a very independent child when you were in Germany? A: Yeah. Q: Okay. A: Yeah, I was -- I -- I -- I -- the fr -- my friends were [indecipherable] all of -- all of them, were almost all gone. You kn ow, the German friends which I had. Q: Yeah. Interview with G unter Haimann August 6, 2007 17A: The German friends wouldn™t talk to me any more after all, because the -- that was t-too dangerous. Q: Yeah, yeah. A: But this is -- Q: Did that bother you, when your German friends wouldn™t talk to you? A: I don™t remember that, I don™t remember. I don™t remember anybody bothering me, but I don™t remember. Q: Do you remember you bein g -- feeling bad about that, that your German friends wouldn™t talk to you? A: No, I wish I would have -- I would feel that way, but I don™t -- I didn™t. Q: You didn™t. A: They were human beings to me, they were boys, they were f -- played -- guys I played with, not guys I -- it was a -- it was a rough time in my life. And when I came over here, United States was not in good shape in 1900 -- in th-that time. Not a real good shape that they could afford so many people. So over here my parents -- when I came, my people who to ok me in, my -- there was a my -- an aunt of mine, didn™t have the kind of money to really ta -- put me up. So in the beginning my father used to send 20 or 30 dollars whenever he got [indecipherable] . Then after awhile they -- he -- he didn™t have any more money, Interview with G unter Haimann August 6, 2007 18and then all of a sudden I hear -- I don™t he ar any more at all. And that™s how that -- [indecipherable] to nothing, until I didn™t find out that Koblenz was being evacuated by the Jews. And I didn™t know whether they™re going to anywhere. But all I found out later on that they were sent to Poland . And I found through different organization, the Jewish orga nization, that they were sent to Poland and they were killed there. Q: Yeah. A: I did get some money from Germany. If [indecipherable] is interested at all, I got 5,000 dollars from -- from [indecipherable] because I -- my father owned that house. That house was worth a lot of money. But at that time they were willing to give -- give me five gra -- I was the only one left of the family, they were giving me 5,000 dollars. I want to tell you what I did with it. I took my kids, when they were about eight, I took them to Germany, show them where I was born. And that™s what I did with it. Q: Yeah. Let™s talk about when you left, how -- how you came over to the United States. So your parents told y ou you™d be coming to the United States -- A: Yeah. Q: -- and you said you were excited. And ho -- A: I was excited is exactly right. Interview with G unter Haimann August 6, 2007 19Q: And where di -- how did you leav e? What did you take with you? A: That™s also a little story.

They didn™t know what to do with us. I™m not speaking good English, I -- I -- I don™t know anything about anything. Q: Mm-hm. A: So they put me in the kitchen. So I was working in the kitchen as KP for two or three months. Getting -- getting good and fa t, but I -- what I -- but I did -- did complain. And I did complain because I wa s feeled, if other people complain, I can complain. And they gave me a -- th-they put me in the ca -- in a place in -- down -- down south, a-a-and -- where they made th -- they -- they want to teach me how to make Morse Code. Speak to each other a-all -- in a Morse Code because I didn™t have to worry about the language so much. So I had a -- and Interview with G unter Haimann August 6, 2007 33worked myself up to a -- to a lieutenant colonel™s [indecipherable] and I was in a -- in the maneuver with him for two months, to give him these -- the signals, so -- so they can communicate. And in that thing, in that thing, I-I came on and I get a notice in -- in -- it was carl -- in -- in [indecipherable] on maneuvers, all German speaking people, please report to wa -- headquarters. That™s me. I go to headquarters. He said listen, you gotta chance to do something here. You gotta chance to make yourself a name, or whatever. We can teach you how to ta -- [phone ringing] Q: You were talking about how you were now down south in the United States -- A: Yeah. Q: -- in the army, and they needed German speaking -- A: Spe -- they need German speaking people -- Q: Soldiers, yeah. A: -- did I tell that? Q: Yes, yeah. A: So when I -- I -- I was told that I can -- I can join a -- a -- a school to teach interrogation. And it™s taken my three months, and it™s done in Maryland , Camp Ritchie. Camp Ritchie, Maryland. And they™ll give you a -- give you a test before, and if I™m interested in a re-report this -- this -- which hap -- ever Interview with G unter Haimann August 6, 2007 34happened, I reported it. And I di d go to the school. I went to Cambridge u -- beautiful place. That™s where the Clintons go. Beautiful. We had -- we were there three months, and we t -- heard how to -- to interrogate. You know how you do that? You have prisoners, American guys, they™re playing prisoners, they teach them how to do -- well -- well, that was a big job. And I speak German, so to me it came natural. So they used a lot of German Jews, who -- for that purpose. And I loved to get out of that -- the -- the swam p in the -- in the -- in down, and I went that school, and I don™t know, three months after that I got a call, get ready, we™re going overseas. Q: Well now, were you a citizen yet? A: Pardon me? Q: Had you become a United States citizen? A: So what is -- that™s what I said, you think [indecipherable] should be a citizen. So I said -- he di -- they didn™t realize it. So they took us to [indecipherable] house, and they made me a citizen. And -- Q: What did it feel like to be a citizen? A: I wa -- I felt like a citizen anyway. I mean, I di-di-di -- it didn™t -- didn™t bother me whether they make me a citizen or not. They™re not going to sent me back to Germany. So I -- I went over there, and went over on the Queen Mary with Interview with G unter Haimann August 6, 2007 3515,000 other soldiers. We had no place to sleep, no place to la -- ah, it was awful. English food. The English tomatoes we had them for breakfast. So I bitched, just like the other soldiers. I™m getting -- I became a bitcher. Now, we went over to E-England and they assigned me to the first division. The first division is the number one division of the United States Army. Is the [indecipherable] machine given to people who will get first the in -- and do in co mbat, always. So I said [indecipherable] and I joined the first division. And when I enlisted to the first division, and I listened to all those guys, how they all die, and before they even dead, they were so worried about everything, I says [indecipherable] maybe this is not a good place for me. Maybe I can get a better job. So I asked the colonel, I™m not so sure whether I™d -- I -- I don™t like to be on boats, and that™s -- you have to be on boats over there. He said, I got another job for you, the airborne. We need a man in a hundred -- hund -- what is it, five or six, or five or s -- five or six parachute infantry. Q: 101st Airborne? A: 101st Airborne. Q: First Airborne. A: If you want that, we™ll transfer you to England to the -- the -- and you have to learn how to jump an airplane. That™s also a job that takes about two weeks. So I Interview with G unter Haimann August 6, 2007 36went -- I made 14 jumps, and they made me a paratrooper, and I -- they assigned me to a five or six parachute infantry, wh ich is one of the regiment of the hu -- 101st Airborne. And that™s where I made it all the way through, through the whole war, wouldn™t -- I didn™t get killed, would you believe it? Q: So now you™re in England , and then what happened? A: From where? Q: From England , you said you were put into the 101st, and you learned how to parachute. A: Oh yeah, we -- we jumped on D-Day, you know, we jump ed. We jumped on D-Day, the night before five -- I have the whole book here, it™s -- I jumped at -- what is it? Q: So you left England to go on D-Day in June of ™44, to jump on -- into Normandy ? A: Yeah. Q: And where did you land? A: In Carentan par -- in -- Carentan is the little French town where we had landed it. Say, maybe you heard Saint wi -- Mere-eglise, St. Mere-eglise? It™s right next to it. That was 101 st Airborne, we jumped there. Very confusing, lot of people got -- lot of killed -- got killed. Lot of -- very, very confusing because as Interview with G unter Haimann August 6, 2007 37the -- the planes, they were -- some of the planes that mo -- listened to the -- to the -- to the real thing. They put them in the -- in the wrong places where they -- they were afraid to go, where there was too much flak, so that they would be shot down. Q: So you di -- you -- A: Lucky enough, I made it down from the airplane, and we had -- we had clickers so that we -- that we don™t have to speak German. The ke -- click -- click the one click and two click. Yeah. Q: So you were with other paratroopers, parachuters -- A: Yes, I was -- I was -- I was part of a parachute team, five or six. Q: Mm-hm. A: And I was -- we in charge of -- in other words, when it -- when -- when the -- when the -- the -- they™re working on the -- o-on the area, they -- they trying to clear the area, they get a -- a -- a prisoner [indecipherable] find out what™s the matter him. Wh-Where is he going? You kn ow, the American soldiers, get going, I haven™t got much time. So it was very difficult sometimes to k -- to keep an American -- a German al-alive to talk to him. Th-There -- these -- these boys were hot from -- from ameri -- from -- from England, also in the middle of -- of -- of being shot at from all over the place, bulle ts and th-the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- Interview with G unter Haimann August 6, 2007 38the flak was flying from -- from -- from the -- from the -- from the ships, from -- from the ba -- from ot -- it-it was -- we dug -- I dug so many holes. I tr -- we tried to dig down and o -- sideways, because there was so many things flying around. But lucky enough I made it, I made -- I got hurt a couple of times, but never -- I got see the fr -- the -- the -- the -- the por -- por -- what do you call the -- the Purple Heart. I got the Purple Heart. Q: You were wounded? A: Yeah. Q: You were wounded. A: Got wounded in the town of Bastogne. That, I™m sure you heard about it. I was [indecipherable] Bastogne speaking to prisoners when they were shooting -- when the German bombs were bombing Bastogne. So it was not a fun -- a fun thing, even though the American soldiers are very, very, very terrific. They good -- they good work, hard working people, and so many of them got killed. Unbelievable. Q: Now here you are, a Jewish soldier, a nd you™re interrogating German prisoners. A: No [indecipherable] was. Q: No what? Interview with G unter Haimann August 6, 2007 39A: Never mind -- never mind the name Jews. If they would have made the wo -- woulda -- word -- the word Jewish, or they say something like that, I would -- I would have killed them, I think. Maybe. I don™t whether I would have done that. You know, and I would think -- Q: But what was your -- what were your feelings here -- A: [indecipherable] feelings think -- ma -- my -- basically feels that he™s a soldier like I am. He is a soldier like I am. He is doing his duty for the country. How can you shoot a man like that? You can -- when -- when you couldn™t help it [indecipherable] the shooting was going on and yo u hit people, you didn™t even know you™re hitting them, but when you™re right in front of them, you have them in front of you, and say you [indecipherable] you say something or I shoot, I couldn™t do that. Not -- every day is people who do that. Q: And there were some American soldiers who did that? A: There™s always somebody who gets killed. Q: Right, right. A: There™s -- there™s so much blood, so much blood in -- in a ca -- in a war, it™s hard to believe. And when you see those young kids wh o -- 18 and 19 years old, you see them laying in the dirt with their -- the-their stuff coming out all over, and that -- it™s a terrible thing and you never forget it. Enough of that. Interview with G unter Haimann August 6, 2007 40Q: But my -- my question is, being a Jewi sh soldier and knowing that your parents were left over, and -- and your brother, did that influe nce your feelings towards these German soldiers? Your particular situation, do you think that influenced you? A: I don™t know, I -- yeah, I -- I -- you know, I think -- I think, when I™m a soldier, I™m a soldier against a soldier. Not against a Jew, or a Christian or anything else. Q: Right. A: I™m a soldier. I™m going to kill this gu y, everything, unless he kills me. So it really has nothing to do with -- with religion. Q: Mm-hm. A: So I -- I will -- I will -- listen, I ha -- I had awful lot of people in -- in front of me who could have been shot. Q: Mm-hm. A: Can you imagine how many people -- sometimes 10 - 15 guys, Americans, will bring in prisoners [indecipherable] you can™t go shoot them all. It don™t make sense. Tho -- some of those poor guys, they™re just as bad off as I was. Q: So now you are working your way from France, and where -- wher -- how did you move through Europe? What was your pathway through Europe , once you™d landed, once you parachuted into France? Interview with G unter Haimann August 6, 2007 41A: After -- well, we parachuted twice, once in -- in -- in France and once in Holland -- Q: Oh. A: -- on a Jewish holiday, Rosh Hashonah, they made me jump. Q: Oh, you parachuted -- A: The -- there was a -- parachuted -- we para -- right near a zone in -- in -- in -- in -- in Holland. We were there to a reunion a few years ago, with my wife. Q: This was in 1944, I guess? A: Yeah. Q: In the fall of ™44? A: No, no, no, this -- this -- this meeting we had, it was just about five years ago. Q: No, no, no, no, when you parachut ed in. When you parachuted into Holland. A: Yes? Q: It was in the fall of 1944. It was after D-Day. A: After D-Day, yeah. Q: Yeah, so it was the fall of ™44. A: Yeah, well the -- that -- that was -- the war was on the way, our wa-way. Q: Yeah. And then -- yeah, an-and -- and then you -- you -- and you -- were -- you were still interrogating German soldiers? Interview with G unter Haimann August 6, 2007 42A: Pardon me? Q: Were you still interrogating German sol -- A: I™m continue interrogating all the time. Q: What kind of questions did you ask them? A: The questions I -- where you shooting, who shooting at me? What kind of gun is it? Is it -- is it a machine gun, is it a -- a rifle? Are there more than five people, is there a hundred people? What™s -- what™s the -- what -- what for -- what™s the chance for us to get in th -- in there? Can we -- can we go? And you hope to God - out of six guys you get one question. This is -- this was my job, and -- a-and whether it worked or not, I don™t know. Q: Did anybody ever ask you how -- any of the prisoners ever -- A: Yes -- Q: -- ask you why -- how do you know German so well? A: No. What I got, I got mostly German sol-soldier [indecipherable] officer said, if you want to kill me, shoot me. You haven™t got the guts. Q: Oh. A: That™s what he said, right in my face. And I didn™t shoot him. Q: Right. But nobody asked you how did you know German so well? A: I don™t know. Interview with G unter Haimann August 6, 2007 43Q: Mm-hm. A: I don™t remember. My German was -- must have been pretty good. Q: Yeah, I™m sure it was. And then w -- after th -- Holland, where did you go? A: Now after Holland came jo -- Bastogne. Q: Mm-hm. A: In Bastogne, then we went into Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf. Düsseldorf I lost one of my -- one of our officers, the colonel, and I -- and I -- and then -- he took a -- he wanted [indecipherable] he wanted to see how these things are near the Rhine. We would l-l-lay along the Rhine, and we lost that -- that c-colonel. Very nice man, very well done. Just killed him, just like that. For no reason they -- the war was almost on the way, you could see the war was on the way off. And he wants to go, I want to see it. Q: Do you remember his name? Do you know -- remember his name? A: No. Q: No? All right, so now you™re in Düsseldorf, and then where do you -- A: I know, I know because his -- was in charge of me. Q: Yeah. And then you continued on from Düsseldorf to where? A: After war? Q: Düsseldorf, after Düsseldorf, where did you -- Interview with G unter Haimann August 6, 2007 44A: Huh? Q: Where did you go after Düsseldorf? A: Düsseldorf, we went towards -- Düsseldorf we went towards southern Germany. The Russians were moving and we were moving towards Russia. We were going towards the downward, down, down [indecipherable] and we ended up in -- near Garmisch Partenkirchen garden -- Garmisch Partenkirchen. Q: Partenkirchen, yeah. A: In Garmischen we were -- we were -- we found all kinds of things. I found Hitler™s fake -- Hitler™s signatures [indecipherable] I have them in a -- in a book. Do you see any things with Hitler in that pile? You™ll find it, if -- I found Hitler™s stationary, so I wrote some letters on that stationary and sent it to the New York Times here, or to one of the newspapers. I have two [indecipherable] of it here in a -- if you find any, keep them. Here -- you know [indecipherable] to me. And I-I wrote a letter to my cousin, who gave it to the Herald-Tribune I think at that time was -- it was -- it went out of business [indecipherable]. And tells me -- tells of how a German Jewish boy goes o -- gets Hitler™s papers, writes them -- Q: Wh-Where exactly did you find this stationary? A: Hm? Q: Where exactly did you find this stationary? Interview with G unter Haimann August 6, 2007 45A: In his hou -- in his house on -- on -- on top of the mountain. In Garmisch Partenkirchen the war was over two days before that. Q: Oh, so now the wa r is already over. A: Yeah, it was all over, the war. So we di -- Q: And Hitler™s dead, you know that Hitler -- A: Hm? Q: You knew that Hitler was dead? A: No, I had no idea of anything. I ha -- I [indecipherable] everybody was still alive as far as we were concerned. Q: Oh. A: So these guys to ok -- took as many people [indecipherable] prisoners as possible. And two days after this, my colonel and I, we became friendly because he likes where I [indecipherable] I sometimes [indecipherable]. He said -- he calls me up, he said, get going, we gotta be there, we got something. That was -- the war was so over, two days already. We got a car. We gotta go, we have a big fish down in Austria. So we went in the Jeep, two of us. We got into -- in Austria and we went into a -- an old [indecipherable] you know, those old [indecipherable] . So we went in there, and there opens up a door. There sits Mr. Goering, with two American generals and his wife, and [indecipherable] . So Interview with G unter Haimann August 6, 2007 46what do I do? There™s this maniac Germ an in front of me. I should shoot him, right? In front of my colonel, and two generals? So the general said to me -- said -- said to my colonel that, let your me n get rid of the people in this [indecipherable] and make it a -- an officer™s place, where th ey can stay for a couple of days. I went inside, and there™s Mrs. Goering, who I knew because from the movies, she™s a movie star. I said to, Mrs. Goering, you may have to leave. A matter of fact, you get your ass out of here within 15 minut es, otherwise I™ll boot you out of here myself. And I™m a Jewish boy. That™s all. And I [indecipherable] around and she starts screaming and [indecipherable] . I said to the sergeant [indecipherable] just get rid of her. Get her out of the house and throw her outside, let -- let her walk out -- walk on. That™s my Goering -- my life [indecipherable] . I saw him -- you see him sitting there all -- all dressed up in his uniforms and everything. And there™s the American generals in their Jeeps, but Goering is in this beautiful st -- fancy go -- [indecipherable] fancy car he has, and a chauffeur there. But he didn™t ask for [indecipherable] . He got to Munich and he killed himself. That wa -- Q: Did you say anything to Goering? Did you say anything to Hermann Goering? A: No. No, they wouldn™t let me -- first of all, the generals kept him -- kept me away from there too. That was too much of a fish for them to catch. Can you Interview with G unter Haimann August 6, 2007 47imagine? See that big, fat bastard in front of me? After all, I know he killed my parents and he killed everyth -- so many Jewish and American and all. What can you do? Take my g un and shoot? I™d be dead. The minute I would touch my gun I™d be dead. Because he was too much a -- too much of a guy to fi -- they want him alive.

So sh -- did she leave then? A: Oh, I don™t know. That -- that was completely out of my say. I was just a sergeant, I was a tech sergeant. These were generals there. Q: Okay, so you don™t know if she left. A: No, I know that -- my colonel told me they™re putting them in the -- in the -- in the Mercedes -- they put them back in the Mercedes and take them to Munich. Q: Uh-huh. A: That™s what he told me.

Q: He committed suicide -- A: Yes. Q: -- before he -- A: Well, this is -- Q: Yeah. A: -- it™s the same thing. He w ouldn™t have lived long anyway. Q: Right. So then, where did you go af ter that? You™re still -- you™re still in Germany. A: Yeah, well, wa -- then th -- we had about a month of n-not too much. We had [indecipherable] to fill and this -- and th-that™s -- it™s beautiful -- beautiful area where we were. [indecipherable] in -- in -- in -- in Austria . It™s bel -- right below Interview with G unter Haimann August 6, 2007 50th-the German border. It™s very, very gor-gorgeous country. And th -- don™t forget, all those people are still Germans. Q: While you were in Germany, while you were there, did you feel American or German? A: Only -- only Amer ican, never German. Q: You did not feel German? A: No way. E-Even when I went to the bakery or something like that. No, unless the-they speak English, I never change. I never would dare change, no. Q: Yeah, but I meant inside, did you feel any connection with Germany, having been born -- A: None at all. Q: -- having been born there? A: I felt very ji -- I felt just where I was belong, where I belong right now, in the army, in -- i-in where I was in -- in that area. Q: What was it like for you to wear the uniform of an American soldier? A: Yeah. Q: What kind of feeling did that give to you? A: Supri -- su-sup-sup -- superiority. It is some sort of a superiority. It is something above [indecipherable] when you have so much in your hand, you Interview with G unter Haimann August 6, 2007 51have almost everybody there, you™ve even got a like -- you can sharpshoot anybody you want and you can -- probably can get away with it. So yo-you feel like shooting. We [indecipherable] we were not Germans, we are Americans. We -- yo- you should see in -- in the little town of Turamsee, the people came to flock -- flock to us, they want to be part of it, they want the -- they want a -- th-this -- the school they want to be part of, they wanted to -- to talk to us. And they di -- they really did -- th-th-the Austrians are much nicer than Ge rmans. They were much nicer to us, because the war was over, too. But then, from then on was downhill. I™m finished after that. We spend about a month there, and I went mountain climbing one weekend with a -- a guide. They gave me a guide and we had two or three women who na -- knew the way, and they took us up -- guides, up to the mountains, to a place where we could sleep. Was beautiful. That™s a beautiful country there. Q: Now this you did on recreation? A: This is -- yeah, the war is over. Q: Did you go by -- earlier did you see any labor camps or other kind of prison camps? Interview with G unter Haimann August 6, 2007 52A: I-I went -- I -- I skipped that labor camp for a reason, it just hurts me. There was a place where -- where -- Hitler wrote a book, ﬁMein Kampf.ﬂ He made a -- a -- a ca -- a -- a -- Q: This was when he was in prison, yeah. A: Pardon me? Q: When he was in prison. A: Yeah. He made a camp out of -- against -- for the Jews, and we come into that camp. I was right in the beginning. I -- sometimes in the beginning, sometimes we -- we switch around so we have -- so we can watch what we doing. And all of a sudden I see guys walking around with [indecipherable], you know? And -- and then they didn™t know what to do, and I didn™t know what to do either. I didn™t know. I spoke to a -- the -- one of the colonels says, listen, these people haven™t eaten anything. They haven™t e-e -- they haven™t gotten anything. I don™t know -- we don™t know what to do yet ourself. We don™t know what the doctor says to do. The best thing is don™t give everythi ng away. Don™t give all your candy and [indecipherable] you™re gonna hurt them. Y ou couldn™t stop the Ameri -- you couldn™t stop the Americans. They gave everything they could find. They [indecipherable] . A-And th-then -- then the -- we were there two nights, just to keep them calm. But they all in their uniform. You should see those little -- we Interview with G unter Haimann August 6, 2007 53went in th -- I went into one of those homes. I don™t even want to describe -- describe it because it™s unbelievable how that people can be alive in th -- it. What they went through and how long they were there, I don™t know. But I don™t remember if they were wi -- man or wife. I don™t even remember that. I -- I co -- did one thing. I get in the middle of town -- because I speak German, I was rather involved in that time there. I put out on top -- on the top of one of those -- those -- those [indecipherable] there. I said, I want every one of these American -- these German soldiers to bring all their pay, all their p -- clothing, which they don™t need all the time, and even if they need, and put them in the middle of that town so these people can eat -- they can live with it. So the -- the -- naturally they all came. They all -- came all -- they all were afraid they were gonna get killed. You know, [indecipherable] speaking the right way, whether they like it or not. And I had no intention of killing anybody. I wasn't alone, there was 20 of us, whole uniform. But we got most of them, and then the doctor spoke to us. Don™t give them any food. Don™t give them anything to eat. It™s just killing them. They had nothing to eat for -- any [indecipherable]. That was awful. That™s ﬁMein Kampfﬂ. That was a -- I forgot that very quickly. Q: What was -- what was the name of that camp? A: ﬁMein Kampfﬂ? Interview with G unter Haimann August 6, 2007 54Q: No, no, no, what was the name of the camp that you came across? A: I just said -- I said, I try to forget again. Q: Oh, okay, yeah. Did you come acr oss any other camps, prison camps? A: No, that™s the only one. Q: That™s the only one. A: Don™t forget, I™m -- I™m -- I™m with a first, front line company. 101st is no -- no -- they don™t jus -- they don™t sit around waiting for work.

Q: Well, if you hadn™t had the challenges -- A: I think so. I think the American wa-way is the only way to live. It has nothing to do with really, the other people. Because here not everybody is going to be alike, but the biggest part of -- just -- just look at the -- the [indecipherable] the White House, what™s going on at -- the time. It™s mutual. It™s somehow mutual that they™re gonna get to a -- to a -- to a -- to a good -- they get together and they gonna get to an end. And they -- they gonna end up all right. At the end of the year we gonna have a good year. It™s 90 percent all of the time. If it™s not good, it™s almost good. And there™s gonna be some bad ones. There™s gonna be a few bad ones, but very little compared to what -- what they had in the -- what they have in th -- in different pl-places the world. They don™t even know how to live, people. They don™t know what life is like. It™s too bad -- it™s just a -- it™s too bad that I had to Interview with G unter Haimann August 6, 2007 65lose my wife. That™s what hurts me more than anything else. And my wife was younger. She was 15 years younger than I am. Q: Did she work? Did she have a job?

I -- I tell you, I -- I was Bar Mitzvah and her parents were not -- not -- not unusually re-religious. Q: Mm-hm. A: And I na -- I don™t know why I™m not more religious, I should be more. But now why should I be more religious, when I lost so much of it? But that™s not a fair way to look at it either. So you have -- now I have -- I have families who need to th -- this religion, and I got -- I ca -- my wi -- grandchildren are terrific. Q: What is it like -- you said you did go back to Germany, and you went back to Koblenz. What -- what™s that like? What was that -- A: [indecipherable] more often. Q: Ye -- I™m sorry, you™ve been?

They have a beautiful country and they have a -- they have a feeling [indecipherable] feeling are very nice. I like that country.

That™s what I meant, when you™re -- do you have any feelings of -- A: [indecipherable] not, no. I have no anger there. Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. A: I know they could do it again. I think they have the -- the -- in the make-up of making it again. But I™m not sure. I™m not going to find out. Q: Why do you say you think they do? A: Why do I say, because I -- they -- they have that -- that excitement in -- in them. It is that scr -- screaming in your face, and hitting you in the mouth and saying, no good for me, you™re no good for me. I have that feeling they would be that way. We™ll see.
