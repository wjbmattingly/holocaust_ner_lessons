DR. JACQUES GODEL August 28, 1995 QUESTION: Where you were bo rn. Date of birth. ANSWER: My name is Jaques Godel. I was born October the 9th, 1924, in Paris, France. Q: Tell me a little bit about your family -- your family and your life before the war. A: My father was born in Roma nia in 1894 and he left Romani a in 1910. And on his way to America he stopped in Paris and stayed there. And after World War I -- he was in the French Foreign Legion during World War I -- he went back to Romania, married my mother, took her to Paris. And so I was born in Paris, my sister was born in Paris. And before the war, life was -- the life of Jewish immigrants in France -- tolerated. I wouldn't sa y affluent, but well-to-do. Until the recession. And we didn't have major prob lems in terms of intoleran ce and suspicion of being a foreigner until really the mid -- late 30's. Very, very shortly before the war. Very sh ortly. And that came about, of course, with in Germany. And a -- the beginning of, or maybe the renewal of French Nationalism, which was very strong during the Dreyfus (ph.) busine ss. Of course, I was not there. My father was not there either, but we knew a lot of people who lived through those times, and I believe th at was the seed of wh at we felt after that. That Dreyfus business was -- is still very important in France, but in the 30's, Dreyfus was still alive, of course. The controversy around his name was really the trigger for the French Nationalism. Q: Did you live in a Jewish community, or were you necessarily integrated into the general -- A: No, we never -- we never lived in a -- well, the Jewish co mmunity in Paris was essentially the , that's -- that is on the right bank of Paris near the Hotel there, that's where you find all the kosher butchers, and where you buy your matzo for Pesa ch and where they have the traditional synagogues and so forth. But other than that area, the Jews were kind of scattered until the 30's or so, when they started to get together in and the Follies Bergere, yes. But, no, we were scattered. We were scattered. Q: Was your family religious? 2 A: No. No. No. Just like so many Jewish families be fore the war, religio n was not -- all our friends -- religion was not an important -- well, we -- young people would be -- yes -- respect it, but we would get gifts at Christmas. And we had br ead for Pesach. We had matzo and bread at the same time on the table. We ate pork. So we were very . And all our fr iends were the same. But we -- culturally, we were very, very Jewish. Very Jewish. There were still many Jewish activities going on in Paris and very strong Yiddish theater. And we grew up with that. There were five or six stages wh ere you could go and ha ve a nice afternoon or evening with Yiddish theater. There were friends of mine who were Scouts and the Scout movement -- the Jewish Scout movement. There were Zionist groups. There were Socialist groups, part of more or less the Bund. And so religion was not very import ant and that always wa s a point of friction when my grandfather visited from Romania. He was ve ry religious. It was always a po int of friction with my family, because he wanted a ko sher plate and couldn't find it, you know. Q: Did you go to school with the Fren ch Catholics? Did you mix socially? A: Oh, I -- I went to school -- my first sc hool -- my -- my -- was kindergarten. That was with the nuns. And what, about three, three and a half, or four. And my sister was born and was really a nuisance so I went to school. And was ve ry good because I needed the . And then after that I went to public school. We had no discrimination -- was not beaten by the other kids because I was Jewish. They never -- ne ver said anything. No, we were normal kids. Q: Did you play with them? A: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Yes. And they played with me and -- sure. Q: What was -- um -- what was your father's business? A: He had a business of interior decoration. Pa inting, wallpaper and -- but on a large scale in the 30's. He would re-do movi e theaters, and small factor ies and stuff like that wi th deadlines so he had to work at night with a large gr oup of people. And they were Ru ssian -- Russian immigrants, those 3 people, who were all first cousin of the Czar, of course, you k now. So it was colorful, it was colorful. That was, you know , until -- until the of '35- '36. That was the turning point. Q: Can we just ask you another question? You had mentioned Jewish cultural and political activities. Where you or y our family involved in them ? Were you Zionists? A: No. No. No. No. We -- we -- just like all the Jewish family we had the blue piggy bank of the where we would put money in it and so mebody from the would come once a month and collect that and that would suppor t -- that would support Israel -- Palestine at the time. And we were getting a Jewish paper, . But that -- that was the extent of it -- was the extent. Just -- just having family members and friends with the same background that was our -- that was the extent of our Jewishness. Q: You had mentioned, al so, Russian immigrants. Was there a difference in the way French -- traditi onally French Jews -- versus immigrants from other -- from Eastern Europe were treated in France? A: Oh, those Russians immigrants were -- were -- none of them are Jewish. Q: Oh. Okay. I misunderstood. A: Oh, they were not -- oh, no, no. I believe maybe one was Jewish. I'm not sure. But all the rest of them were -- were -- I don't know if they were -- they were -- the White Russians. Yes. They were counts, and were really a fu nny bunch of people. But they were good workers so my father hired them. Q: So in the 30's when Hitler came to power, how aware were you of what was going on in Germany? Were there refu gees coming into Paris? A: The refugees started to come in '38. Most of the refugees that we saw were from Austria. And I remember one of them -- whose na me was Godel also -- and he came to see us and my father helped him. And we got in touch with hi m after the war. He wa s able to come here to the United States. 4 And we lost track of him -- but -- and so they told us what was going on. They told us. I don't remember being in co ntact with German Jews, but Austrian Jews, yes. Yes. Q: What was -- what was your reaction to this? This information you were getting? A: Uh, well, we -- I know my parents were very, very upset. Very, very upset. And we were looking at Hitler as -- as a danger. But at the same time, being in France, you know, the traditional enemy of Germany, th e strong French Army. We felt very secure. Well, if they move, we're going to leave them and Hitler is going to go back to Bohemia, or wherever he came from. That was the feeling in France. Very few people were aware of what happened. Very few. Q: So you weren't part icularly threatened? A: We -- we -- we were not -- no -- not by the French, no. No. No. Q: But by the Germans? A: Germany was -- was a danger for -- for the world. People were talking about re-armament of Germany and so forth, but at the sa me time, we -- we -- as I say, y ou know, we were feeling that we had the Maginot line protecting us, that the Fren ch Army was so strong, that we had the best weapons, and so forth. And all th at propaganda of the French government, trying to -- not trying -- but -- I believe they believed that, themselves, you know. They believed that, yes, the Maginot line was very strong, that the French engineers were building the best tanks, and building the best airplane, and the French Army was invincible. The navy was the second in the world, and so forth. So -- and -- yes. Q: When did you learn differently? A: At the defeat of France, 1940. Q: What happened? A: Well, when the French Army collapsed and all of a sudden German soldiers were invading France, that's -- that's when we fe lt the impact of defeat. And the danger of an enemy of France and the Jews at the same time. So -- so we were threatened on two aspect s. So it was real ly a feeling of total despair and fear all of a sudden. 5 All of a sudden. A different reality. And we had to adjust to that different reality. Q: Do you remember when th e Germans occupied Paris? A: Well, we left Paris th e 10th of June in 1940. We were among the last to leave Paris. Everybody was leaving. And -- well, we were just outside of Paris in that place where we spent the first two years of the war. And the -- Q: Can you describe to me the German occupation of Pari s? The initial -- the first days. A: I was not there. Q: Oh. A: I was not there. No, I can describe the German oc cupation of Brittany -- th e first days. Where -- it was about the 15th or 16th of June and we had reached that small place in Brittany. Peaceful, beautiful medieval town with old, walled medieval town and it was beautiful, beautiful summer -- oh, spring. And it was the first time that we really were out so -- that far from Paris in a couple of years or so. And it was very nice. Very, very nice. Beautiful landscape and the smell of country. And so we used to walk in the evening around that -- that small city. Q: What's the name of the city? A: . And in the distance we coul d see -- on the road in the dist ance -- moving side cars -- motorcycles. We could see that in the distance. And we had seen very few French soldiers in the preceding days. There were very few French soldiers in that area, practically none. Were just a few stragglers who were trying to go wherever they could. And so we saw -- late at night -- it was almost dusk -- and the color of th eir uniform was strange. It was very strange. So at first we thought they were British soldiers who were trying to -- to go back to Brest to -- we were told that the British were re-e mbarking that area. No, they were Germans, and it was absolutely frightening, because they were -- I'm sure they were exhausted. And they were two to a motorcycle. One was driving and the other one was in the sidecar with a machine gun. And their face was -- they were blonde and -- they were -- they had the typical Germ ans. And their face cove red with the dust of the 6 road -- they were looking absolutely -- they were awful. They we re raw, military power. And of course, I understood that years la ter, when I was myself in the Ar my, the people who are sent like that are the best. They are the people who can analyze a situation and take action and so forth. So they passed by us, and I remember we were walkin g by the barracks of the Fr ench Gendarmes and it was a hot evening and they had like a balcony at the barrack s there with the sign and the flag. And the wife of one of the Gendarmes ther e almost collapsed. She had a -- she had a cry. And they removed the French flag immediately. They knew what -- so -- and they disappeared. And then the next mornin g, the other came, and they were the Herman Goerring (ph.) division. And they came with big guns and we apons and so forth. And they st opped to engage in conversation with us. And -- I'm sure they were under orders to be very friendly -- and they were friendly. They were friendly. One of them asked me why I was not in the army. And I told him, "Well, I'm 15." He said, "Well, in Germany, 15, . And they were very proud to be member of the Herman Goerring division. And they were telling us, Well, a week we'll be in England. And after that they left. I don't know where th ey went. And they were replaced by the regular German Army. That place was like an administrative city, so th ey established a commandanture there. But that was essentially for them -- you know, they -- they or dered a curfew for the population and stuff like that . But at the same time they were trying to show to the French people that, Well, we are not that bad. And I remember, we stay ed there one month befo re we were able to go back home. And one of the son of that city was a Navy officer who died at Dunkirk. And his body was recovered and was sent to th at place to be buried in the fa mily vault. And the whole city came to the funeral in the church . And the Germans sent an honor guard there. Yes. And they allowed his coffin to be draped in the French fla g. So -- and when -- when -- so they had a Mass inside the church and when they came out, you know, people were carrying the coffin on their shoulders, and the Germans had the sa lute with their rifles. Yes. Q: Now, I may have interrupted you earlier. When y ou were -- when you le ft Paris to go to Brittany -- 7 A: Yes. Q: -- was that because you a ll felt it was safer because the Germans had already arrived? A: Well, it was -- was -- was also because the battlefront was getting close to us. And the day that we left -- we were living outside Paris and it was like a development, we -- I me an, little cottages, and a garden. It was our second home, actually . And we could hear the gun all night long -- guns -- big guns. Big guns, artillery. Which were close to us. And German plan es flying all over and so forth. And then in the morning wh en we got up, at the end of the streets -- of the street there, a company, or a platoon of French infantry. And they were col onial troops. They were Senegalese. They were in foxholes with -- looked like a battle was going to take place right there. So we fled. We fled. And our neighbor -- ne xt-door neighbor -- was from that place and she sa y, Okay, we'll take -- her son was fighting -- and she's saying, Okay, let's go to my si ster's in Brittany. So we took the train. The trains were still working. You know, it's crazy -- stuff is absolute ly crazy. So the trains were working, we got to Paris. We had to change railroad station -- we went from to . And there, of course, it was confus ion. They didn't know which tr ain would leave at when, but they were trying to get the train. And finally we got the train which was going the direction that we wanted to go. It took us like -- quite -- almost a day. The train was packed but we got there. And when we got out of the ra ilroad station, the taxis were there. I -- life was nor mal there. The taxis, people were in the si dewalk cafe and -- th ey didn't know. Q: You went up there, yo u said, in early June? A: We left Paris June the 10th. Q: Hadn't -- hadn't the Germans al ready come into France in May? A: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Yes. Q: But just not into Paris yet? 8 A: Not -- no, no. They entered Paris, I believe, Ju ne the 15th. We were -- actually, we didn't have to leave that area but we didn't k now that at the time, see. Thos e soldiers who -- Paris was an open city. Was declared an open city . So the defense around Paris wa s canceled by the French military people or -- I don't know, maybe they just fled, you know. But one of the last major battles of Paris took place maybe ten k ilometers from where we were . In the forest -- it's a dense -- at the time, it was a dense forest. Part of that big forest go ing from __________ all th e way to _________ and so forth. And the French fought very, very ha rd in _________, which is 25, 26 kilometers from Paris. And we went there when we came back in July and nothing had cha nged from the battlefield except that the dead were buried. But it was pr ovisional graves, with wo oden crosses and helmets which were on the ground, and weapons and -- it was the remnants of a ba ttle. And you could see that the battle was fierce. Q: When you were living that month up in Brittany and the Germans were there, did they distinguish between Jews and non-Jews? A: Oh, no. No. The Germans couldn't care less. At the ti me -- they were in the German Army. And they -- they interfered very little with the French administration. The armistice had been signed. The Vichy gove rnment was in charge. The German s were controlling, essentially -- railroad system was controlled by them, maybe the pos t office, in terms of s upervision. But they had absolutely no interference with the French, absolutely none whatsoever. Actually, they were trying to be friendly. They didn' t ask anybody "Are you Jewish or not?" No. Absolutely not. Q: So you decided to return to Paris? A: Well, we had to. We had to. We had to. We couldn't stay there. The -- that village was very, very -- that city was ver y, very small. We had no place to stay. We -- ou r money was running out. My father couldn't work there. So since we were in the occupied zone anyway, we had to go back home. So -- and the German also wanted the peop le who were refugees to go back to where they came from. And so I believe that they had like a census, or whatever. I know we needed a special form to get on the train. And th at was the German who gave that. And maybe they asked if -- I 9 don't recall exactly, but they might ha ve a box on that form , or one way to ask if you were Jewish or not. But I'm not quite sure. But anyway, to get on that train, you needed a pass from the Germans. And we got there, we got into Paris. And that's when the impact also -- we left Paris and and Paris a month earlier was Paris -- you know, the buses, and the cars, and the taxis and no German. And all of a sudden, there were very few bu ses, no taxis -- now taxis were ju st for the Germans. There were very few taxis which were reserved simply for the Germans. And Germans everywhere, in all kinds of uniforms. All kinds. And they had taken the cafe and that was a -- and this and that, and restaurant . And they had poste rs with propaganda and warnings. It was a sad picture. A very sad picture. And so many -- so many business were -- were still closed down. People had not returned. So we arrived there and the Me tro was working -- Metro was workin g. So we took the Metro. Went to th e other station, took the train and went back home. That was July, 1940. And life was -- life was as usual, at least temporarily. Until -- I'm trying to remember if it was September of that year that -- that was the German who asked -- the census of the Jews. But the census was done by the French. And my father ha d to go to . was the administrative center -- it wa s the of that department where we were, which was at the time called and now it's -- I don't know what. It was change d since then. So he went there and he had to register. And he regist ered the whole family. And that was the beginning of that of that spiral of discrimination and persecut ion and so forth. So -- so shortly after that, he had to fill out forms about our belongings, our furn iture, our jewelry, our books of art, et cetera, et cetera. And then we couldn't have a telephone, we couldn't have a radio set. And so that was in 1940. And then he had restrictions about what he could do, in term s of work. He couldn't do this, he couldn't do that. But he was still working. He couldn't care less. And I was going to school, my sister was going to school. And for ordinary life -- life was absolu tely normal for us. We had -- we had very -- except for those restrictions. And we couldn't travel too far. But -- but ot her than that, we could go to the movies, we could go to -- our food -- you know, the coupons for food we re the same as the 10 general population. We had absolutely no discrimi nation at that time, either from the Germans or the French. Absolutely none. None . Then in 1942, that's when things started to change drastically. Q: All of this time between fall of 1940 and '42, your life was relatively normal? A: Absolutely. Q: In Paris? A: Outside of Paris. The . Q: Okay. You -- okay, I'm sorr y, because I didn't under -- I don't think you told me that you had gone to . A: Oh, that was at the beginning of the war, in 1939. We were af raid of Paris being bombarded, so -- and the French government aske d people who had family in th e provinces or a secondary home outside of Paris to leave -- most of the big cities. They asked most of the big cities, but essentially Paris. They did the same in England, by the way, at the beginning of the war. And they sent the children all over the place and some of them were sent to Engl and also -- to the United States -- English children -- and Canada. So -- so we had that second hom e, and we moved there. We moved there. At fi rst my father was still keep ing his business in Paris. And the business was not good anymore. So -- and he was known locally, so he fo und a -- he found enough to do locally. Q: Did you have to id entify yourselves as Je ws? Did you have to w ear a star? Did you -- A: No. Not from 1940, until 1942. Q: And you still had good relations with your neighbors or Christian friends at school? A: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Absolutely. Ab solutely. Absolutely. It was -- life was -- was very normal. Very normal. Yes. Q: Okay. So you were saying that this went on until sometime in 1942? A: I'm trying to remember if -- I be lieve in 1941 they arrested -- they started to arrest Jews in Paris. I believe that was when they put them in the ther e. I believe that was July, '41. Q: I think it was '42. 11 A. '42? Okay. Okay. So that was the turning point. When -- when -- July, '42, when -- yes, yes, that's July, '42. Because my sist er was spending the night in Paris with some friend s of ours during that night when they came to arrest people. And they -- the friends were living almost at the top of the building and they could hear the police in the middle of the night, climbing the stairs, knocking on the doors, and so fort h. So their next-door ne ighbor, who was Christia n, got them in their apartment. And that's why -- that's how my sister was able to escape that night. So -- so shortly after that -- no, befo re that -- shortly before that -- Q: Let me interrupt you. Because I think for the record, when you say the Velodrome, I don't think that somebody watching this tape might know what you're talking about. I mean, I know what you're talking about -- A: Yes. Q: -- but somebody else may not. A: Okay. was a indoor stadium in Paris, built around the turn of the century, essentially for bicycle races. That's where they have the six days of Paris. Like the six da ys of -- I don't remember where, but it was very popular at the turn of the century. And it we nt on for maybe 50 or 60 years. And people would go there for six days. They would bring food an d so forth and they would watch those -- those people would race around like squirre ls for six days. And so that stadium was big enough to accommodate -- not accommodate -- not accommodate -- but to sit maybe two, three thousand people. And when the Fren ch police arrested the Jews in Pa ris for the first time on a large scale after the agreements between the French government and the Vichy government and the Germans, they had not made provisions to house su ch a large population. So they decided to park them in that stadium, which was called . And -- because it was the winter one -- it was covered. So the conditions there were absolutely appalling. And the French people who were allowed to -- the French Red Cross, and so forth -- were allowe d to go there and try to give some milk for young children or medication for elderly pe ople were so appalled by what they saw, I 12 believe it helped later on, to a certain extent, to open the eyes of French people and try to help the Jews in the future. Or at least to avoid being involved. And they really saw that, and the Catholic charities also were involved. And so it became a big controversy among the French people. They didn't realize that discrimination could be that bad. And some were pleased, of course. Saying "Well, the Jews deserved that." But I don't believ e they were a majority. I don't believe that. So that's the . Which means the winter -- how do you say -- velodrome -- bicycle track. Q: Yes. A: As opposed to summer. Q: And once people were taken there -- once the Jews were rounded -- of Paris were rounded up and taken there -- A: So -- so then the French government decided that they would use a place called . And was a huge public housing project which was not complete in 1941 or '42. So they transferred the Jewish population from to . And became, really, the first -- the first stop to Auschwitz in the history of the persecution of the Jews in occupied France. And we knew people who were there. Some -- some people were released from . But the agreements between -- from what I understand -- th e agreements between th e German and French was that the French had to arrest so many people, like a quot a of Jews. And they would be arrested until they had enough cars and railroad cars and so forth to take them wherever they had to go in Germany or Poland. But after that they opened other camps in occupi ed France. near was one. And -- I'm trying to remember the other one -- but those were the two places, -- I don't believe was only for Jews. was esse ntially for Jews. Q: Were the Jews who were sent there initially French Jews? A: No. No. No. No. They we re essentially Jews with -- the first one were German Jews -- well, essentially, Polish Jews or Jews who had no nationality. or whatever. Yes. 13 Q: You said that this was a real turning point in people's perception -- in non-Jewish people's perception. Up until then, were they fairly respectful of the occupation and of the Vichy government? A: No. No. Not -- not in the occupied zone. In the occupied zone, the fe elings were either, well, we are defeated, we have to survive, we have to -- we have to just, you know, go with the crowd. Or there were others who were saying, well, we ar e going to build a new Europe, a new world. And we have to -- we have to get rid of the Jews and the Free Mason and Communism -- Communism, that was the Bolsheviks. And then there were the people who were either openly against the Germans and Vichy or secretly ag ainst the Germans and Vichy. And the French -- the French, basically, are -- they hate the Germans just as much as the Germans hate the French. It's a tragedy of hist ory that two nations which are so different have a -- are neighbors. And even to this day, France and Germany, yes, they are big friends, but, no. No. They are very , very different. And the feelin gs -- the feelings of the French are still anti-German. Q: So you began to say in '42 w ith this massive round-up in Paris, things st arted changing for you. You were living in . A: Yes. Yes. So -- so we kne w that -- and people were telling my father also, you know, you're crazy to stay -- to stay -- to stay here. You have to leave. You're going to be arrested.They -- so what they were doing, they were -- they started with Paris, and they were -- they were using -- it was like -- like -- you know, like when you drop a stone in water, you have those waves. And -- and so they were arresting very systematic ally by zone, so such date was th e arrest in that area. And that was all planned with the French po lice, the number of room available there and there, and so forth, and the over-time for the police. It was -- was -- just -- I found out af ter it was very -- it was -- life was normal for those cops. Yes. Okay, so what are we doing today? Oh, arrest those people -- that's -- so we knew that it was co ming in our area. Our neighbor to ld my father they arrested Jews in . was about six mi les from us. And so -- but we - we -- we didn't know exactly 14 what was going on. I -- I -- I had the feeling -- and I knew -- I didn't know exactly, but the Royal Air Force would drop leaflets over France, which was called the . And it was like a little newsletter, printed on very, very thin paper, but strong paper. And they would drop that by the thousands. And they had that warning for the Jews, talki ng about the group, and the Jews who were gassed in trucks. And that was, I believe th at was in early April of th at year that I got that -- one night we heard the planes above our head, and the next morning we had those flyers in our garden. And we were not supposed to pick them up. We were supposed to call the German immediately. But -- so we read that, and I became very, very, very tense. But the propaganda from Jewish people was that, don't listen. That's not true. How can the Germans, such a civilized nation, do things like that? No. They just want to send the Jews in camps to work. Why elderly people and children work in camp, though. So -- so -- so -- my -- my parents were trying to -- to believe that, see, because, it was -- where could we go? We had no place -- we didn't know. So the pressure on my father wa s such -- and on friends also was such -- that he got in touch with people who were working in the diamond business. And the diamond business, they were very chummy with the Germans. The Germans were dealing in diamonds, and gol d, and so forth. And the only people they could deal with were the Jewish peopl e who were in that busine ss. And so -- I don't know all the details because I was not curious at th e time -- but my father got in touch with an organization through that -- one of the diamond dealer -- where we would cross from occupied France into non-occupied France on a regular train. And one person, I believe he was German, had those pass, those -- those made in our name. An d so the day that we left, which was November the 7th, on a Friday -- Q: 1942? A: 1942. That same day -- we were not sleeping in our home for a few days, we were sleeping at neighbors -- and -- what's that? Q: Do you hear th e noise outside? A: Yes. Okay. 15 Q: You said you were stayin g at a neighbor's house. A: Yes, we were staying at ne ighbor house. The same neighbor who took us to her sister in Brittany. And -- and I was going to school in Paris at the time. I decided that Paris was the safest. Because nobody knew me in Paris. I would take the train early in the morning, it was dark, and that was like a -- not exactly boarding school, but I took one meal there and I would come at night and when I was in that school I was safe. It was called . It was a very old college which Loyola attended in the 1500's. It was a private school, they didn't care, th ey didn't ask an y questions and I was not wearing my -- the star. An d I never wanted to wear the star, I took a chance, but I never -- didn't wear it. So I was going to th at school and was trying to blen d with the rest of the people. And no question asked, absolutely nothing. It was -- the other people and, you know. And so -- but when I was going back home, the pre ssure was there. So anyway, my father got that -- into that organization and the day that we were leaving, that's the day they came to ar rest us. But they didn't have enough people to arrest us, so what they were doing, they sent a cop and asking us to go to the precinct with all our papers and so forth for busi ness -- for personal business -- and we knew what it was. And so -- and so the railroa d station was about a mile from our place and we were -- we knew the train was taking us to Toulouse. Our neighbor next door had a niece who was living very close to the Spanish border in that small village and that was a village called . Okay. Q: Well, I was asking you, before you fl ed for the , how normal your life really was. I mean, you went to school in Pa ris, and you returned to at night. Bu t there must have been -- End of Tape 1 16 TAPE NUMBER 2 A: Oh, okay. So the first -- the first year of the Occupation, at fi rst, we were -- we didn't know what was going on. So we didn't want to make any moves, we just didn't know. So I -- I attended a local school in there. And the second year -- that was 1941, '42 -- since life was -- was more normal, I went back to a school -- not in Paris, but in , which is about 32, 35 kilometers outside of Paris, where I went during the first year of the war -- from 1939. 1939-1940. And in that school, things were absolutely normal. I would leave in the morning, take the train to -- or if the weather was nice, ride my bike -- was no more than -- I don't know -- maybe 12 miles or less than that. And go to school. At lunch time, we couldn't eat in school because of the shortage of food, so the school had an agreement with a restaurant in town where the Germans also had an agreement. So we would go to that restaurant and eat like regular customers ther e. And we had a special discount because it was the school, and the food was good. Because we were in a rural area, so we had plenty of food. And the Germans were next to us an d they would greet us. And I re member one of them one day was like, crying, and we didn't know what happened, and the waitress say "Oh, poor guy. He got his orders to go on the Russian Front. " And saying "Good." So -- so life -- and we had sports in school, and we would travel to play with different schools, so we would travel in a radius of 60, 65 miles of Paris. And most of the time we had one of ou r teachers, but I remember one -- one day we didn't have our teacher, so we really -- really had -- you know, like teen-a ge boys who are left on their own and -- and we ha d a lot of fun. And -- Q: A: Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Q: Was there any sense of wh at else was going on? Of detention? Of round-up? A: Well, we -- we -- we were livi ng with that constant threat of th e round-up. The constant threat of what is going to be the next step, what ar e they going to do to us? And -- and -- and nobody wanted, really, to face that. There were very few people who wanted to face that. We were living 17 just the day to day, and okay, tomo rrow -- and tomorrow -- we'll see tomorrow. But then when -- when the round-up started really to affect us, when friends or me mbers of families were arrested, when the restrictions on what we c ould do started really to show that it's not that benign. Things are going to be very drastic. That's when -- that's when we -- we decided to take action. So some people went into the Resistance, some people trie d to go into hiding, some people went to their nation of origin, trying to like -- like some of the Romanian went to th e Romanian embassy and were trying to go back to Romania because -- we -- we were receiving letters from Romania. They were censored, but still they were -- they were normal letters. And they were -- we could guess from what they were telling us that life was very normal, and they were saying "Why don't you come here? Why do you st ay there, you know, fa r away from us?" So -- but the Romanian and other nation didn't want the Jews there, see. So y ou could feel that the trap was -- was really -- was really closing down on you and the game was to find a hole in that trap. And everybody had a different story or a different people trying to help. And so the goal was to go into Vichy France -- unoccupied France. But at least we are not with the Germans. So -- so there were all kind of ways to get there -- illegally, I mean. And -- but they were dangerous. All of them were dangerous. And -- and some unscrupul ous people were making good money by -- by telling people "I will take you over the border," and robbing them or selling them to the Germans an d so forth. So -- or killing them. Q: You knew this at the time? A: Yes. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Yes. We knew that because we heard of families who were -- who tried to get over and we never heard of them agai n or -- or -- we knew they had been arrested. And so -- so you were supposed to go to that farm, and at the end of the field it was Vichy France and they had a waiting for you with a bi cycle or stuff like that. So me -- some were legitimate, I know people who crossed like that. But -- and it was a big -- a long border between -- between Occupied and not-Occupied France. But my father found that way where it was really -- at least from the -- from what we were told -- was strictly safe. We took the train. We -- before we got to 18 that checkpoint, whoever was the guide would give us our pass, the German would come, and they were legitimate pass in our name, and they couldn't see that they were -- they were forged. And they would stamp them and then two hours later we would be out of Occu pied France. It was costly. Q: Did -- were ther e other people who were travelling with you? A: It was a large group. And I was never curious about that, but my Mother told me that after the war, she heard on the radio a -- French radio -- a program about that group. And essentially, why it was so costly, it's beca use what they were doing, they were a Jewish organization who was taking the children of people who had been rounded up a nd their children had been -- not arrested -- hidden. And they were taking them to farms an d so forth in unoccupied France. And they were always with adults and th ey -- the adults were like their parents, and so fo rth. And they would do that, I believe, once a week, or on ce every two weeks, I don't reme mber exactly. But my mother told me -- but I never had the curiosity to go to the and find out. No. After -- after that -- after the war, I just -- I just sayi ng well, we escaped, and the past is the past. It's only now that saying well, I don't have that many more years, and maybe somebody should know what happened. But at the time, everybody had the same story. Ev erybody who survived the war, Jews or non-Jews, survived the war. And we all had this story. All of us. Q: So you were on a train going south? A: Yes. The regular train to from Paris to Toulou se. And when -- we left with another family who were close friends of the family fo r -- forever. And we had forged papers. And everybody knew us in that -- in that community. So -- so we went to the railroad station, take the train and we had -- like we go on a vacation. You know, we had suitcase s, bicycles. And we put that on the train to Toulouse. And -- and the man at the railroad sta tion, he had been there for years and years and years, and he knew us, especially the other co uple -- everybody knew they were Jewish. And he looked at us and he say "Toulous e? You have a ticket for Toulouse ?" Yes. Okay. So we went, you know, and we had just small suitcases that we kept with us, including one with the food that my 19 mother saved. And so we had -- sh e had sugar, and she had oil, an d she had coffee, and she had all kind of stuff like that. And we ca rried that on the train. And we spent -- we went to dinner -- to friends of ours. The wife of a friend of ours who was a prisoner of war, so she -- she was safe because of that. And then we went to and took the train for To ulouse. And we were -- we -- we -- the compartments were book ed in advance, not by us, but by that organization, so we -- when we got there we got our seat assignment in the train. And -- no, we got in the station -- railroad station -- there are Germans at patrol, they had French police patrollin g. But they were not checking anybody. Absolutely not. During -- at least that time. Mayb e some other time they would round up people or what but nobody asked us anything. We went on the train, nobody said "Do you have a pass?" or what. Absolutely not. The train -- okay. What they wanted is "Did you pay your fare to go to Toulouse?" That's what they wanted to know. So we went there. Q: Did your card identify you as being Jewish? A: Yes. Q: Forged card? A: Yes. Yes. No, not the forg ed one. My parents had the forged one. I had my regular one. And a year earlier it was stamped "Jew" with a big red stamp. . A nd a friend of mine told me that if you dip a wooden match w ith a cotton tip -- like a Q-tip -- if you dip that in bleach and you go very carefully over the red, it disappear. So I t ook a chance and I went very carefully over -- did that -- took one of those long, wo oden matches that we still had in France at the time, with the cotton, bleach, and it disappeared. So the only -- the on ly way they could have found that I was Jewish was if I would be arrested in circumstan ces where they would check on my identify. But mine was a legitimate one. You could see that it was not forged. And I was taking a chance because had they checked on me, asked that precinct there in "What about him?" and they would have looked in their and said "Oh, . But I took a chance. I wanted to survive at the time. And so -- so we -- we crossed that -- that line of demar cation. It was very impressive. Very, very impressi ve. It was -- was very scary, because the train would stop in the 20 middle of the night and you had to have the curtains down and sit in your seat and you were not allowed to look outside. And we could hear, you know, the Ge rmans walking up and down like a wooden with their heavy boots in the mi ddle of the night there. . And from both ends of the train they had Ge rman soldiers with -- officer and so forth -- checking those there. And they were talking lo udly among themselves. And was ve ry organized. And the German Army is very militaristic and traditional. And I found out that in their rules and regulation when you have a check-point, you have to ask, I believe, a major and a nother officer and an NCO and then you have to have a private holding a -- one of those lamps -- oi l lamp. So they were -- I can see -- still see that tall German officer who was, I believe, a ma jor or something, who must have been a hero of World War I. He must have been in his 50's and talking to the other one, and the NCO and they were looking at the and they were looking at the identity card, and they wanted to find out what was in my mother's suitcase. So she opene d that and the oil was all over the sugar and everything, so they laughed and they said "Well." And then they have that little guy with the lantern following and he was just as frightened as we were. And so just before the train left, I was too curious. I had to peep out . And I saw that and it was real ly frightening. We were -- we were on a -- like a -- a platform with barbed wire, big floodlight s and those Germans going up and down with their rifle on their shou lder. Oh, it was -- so th e train left, and by th en we -- we were on the other side, and the man who was with us came back to collect those -- our . And he told my -- he told us Okay, be very careful when you get into Toulouse because there are very important events which are taking place in the world. And the same night that we got there, Eisenhower landed in -- in Casablanca. Was during the night Saturday to Sunday. And the Germans occupied France the 11th of November, and they were planning to do that , from what I understand, a long time before they did, but three da ys later the Germans were back. We saw the German back. So -- but at least this time, nobody knew where we were, nobody knew who we were . So we got to that niece of our neighbor who didn't know wh o we were. Q: This is in Toulouse? 21 A: No, no. This is -- this is -- no. So we left Toulouse. Q: How long were you in Toulouse? A: The time to change trains, to get to . And we -- we -- we had absolutely no idea of where it was. So we had to collect our luggage and everything came through, including my bicycle. And everything, you know, was there. So -- so we ask "How do we go to ," and the guy said "Okay, you have to take that train and change train at that" -- we had to take two trains, so okay. So we went to buy the ticke ts, get all our luggage again to go to that place. And we had maybe -- and our friends left. Left, and they were very scared. They had one in Toulouse, so we didn't see them 'til afte r the war. And so we took that train. And the train was working maybe twice a week. And that was a Saturday. And the tr ain was working on the Saturday, so by the time -- and it was very early in the morning. We got th ere like 5:30, 6 in Toulouse. And my mother was very pleased because she saw a French soldier on the platform there in Toulouse. A French soldier of the Vichy Frenc h. But still, it was -- you know, French flag and -- it was French. Not German. So -- so we get -- we get in by ab out 1 p.m. And by th en my parents were absolutely exhausted. They were -- couldn't take it anymore. So they say "O kay. You have a bike. We don't know where that village is . We don't know anythi ng. You go and you find out." So I got on my bike and I asked my direction and I got into that village. And I asked about that lady and they told me where it was. And I knocked on their door and I say "Well, we are the neighbors of your aunt." And "Ah. Ok ay." And they say "Well, we have a problem." She was living in a big home with a young son and she was -- she had been widowed mayb e less than a month before that. Her husband was much older than she was, and he was a disabled veteran of World War I who had been gassed and he died. He was fairly young when he died, he was -- he wa s not 60. But she was -- she was -- at the time she was like 31, 32. Sh e was a young widow, a very young widow. And so -- so I told her, you know, we are Jewish people a nd she -- she didn't know what Jewish meant. It was a small village. She came fr om Brittany. She just didn't know anything. She say "Oh, you can stay here. Sure, I have room." But I have my father, my mother and my sister. "Oh, where are 22 they?" I say, you know, the railroad station. She sa y "Okay, I'll go with you." And she told her son "Okay, finish your lunch" -- it was lunchtime -- "and go back to school." And so we went to pick up my parents and we took the lugga ge and she said "Let me prepar e lunch for you." And then she say "Well, we have to have a scenario because th ere is a lot of family, so you are going to be the cousin from Brittany." So we became the cousin from Brittany. And we knew the fa mily so well and -- but they say -- "But how co me we didn't see you at the wedd ing?" and this and that or -- "Well, we were not there." Or , you know, things during the fam ily. So -- so then when the Germans came, a few days later, my parents had to be in hidi ng because she felt that it was suspicious to have the whole family. So we stayed -- my sister and I were supposed to stay with her. And my sister was still an age to go to school. But nobody was saying anything about she has to go to school. So we -- we were there and my parents were hidi ng and when people were coming in the house, they were moving the house and you could hear that. And finally, little by little, people started to find out, beca use we told them and my parents were telling them. So we told a close friend of hers -- her husband was the guid e who took us over the mo untain and was also the guide for Arnold, I found out. And th en another friend of her was th e mayor of a small city and he was getting memos from the police a bout the different operation. And he would tell us "Oh, they are preparing an operation against the Jews in Toulouse," and this and that. And -- and finally she went to Paris, and she had a sist er whose husband was a prisoner of wa r. Her sister was absolutely beautiful. She was one of the most beautiful women that you ca n see. And she had a young boy. And she was the mistress of a Ge rman officer who was in Paris th ere. And so the lady who was taking care of us -- they went there to see her an d we asked her to see some people that we knew also so she we nt there. She stay about a week. And when she came back, she say -- that was April, '43 -- she told us "Well, I cannot keep you anymor e." And she say "No. I talk to my sister and I talk to Willy (ph.)" -- Willy was th e German officer and frie nd -- "and Willy say 'You are crazy. You are hiding Jews in your home. And you have -- just across the street you have the German Commandanture. And you are -- you are alread y flirting with danger. If anything happens, 23 those people are going to be sent to the camps, and you going to be shot.' So she came back absolutely frightened. She say "You cannot stay anymore." So my moth er was absolutely -- absolutely -- totally -- totally depressed. And so we had like a big family reunion. And we were so close to Spain that we say "Well, let's go to Spain." Q: Before you made this deci sion, you were in th is town four or fi ve months, right? A: From November the 7 or 8th. And that was April -- th e first week of April. Q: So what was the daily life lik e? How threatened were you? Were you just living normally? A: Well -- okay -- so the German s came and they were not in the area. But then around January or February -- I don't remember exactly -- they had like a red zone going all along the French-Spanish border -- all along. And that was extremely, extrem ely reinforced in terms of patrol, and so forth. And that -- that small place where we were was a village with maybe two or three hundred people, that's all, see. So -- so it had two or three streets at the most. So one street was th e main road, so to speak. No. It's a narr ow road going from one small village to the other. It was the way to Spain anyway. And the other one was like a very narrow street -- I don't even know if it was paved or not -- leading to -- not even -- they didn't even have an y shops there. Just farm s and so forth. And they had like a general store which was just across the house where we were in hiding. And the house was close by the road. I should have taken a pictur e of that with me, but it doesn't matter. So -- and right across the street, they had that general stor e. And they were selling, you know, the tobacco, and it was like a -- the baker would come and leave bread there and so forth. And they would sell liquor, and wine, and it was like a big place, so - when the Germans draw that line and they had patrol post every mile or so, that was the headquarter there. Right across the street from us. And the people who were the owner of that -- of that general store, their son was in the Waffen SS -- French. And they were suspicious that something was not right with us. But they knew the husband of that lady extremely well. He was a resp ected World War I veteran, he was the chief of the veteran organization, and so forth. And -- so -- so they didn't want to -- to really -- at the time, annoy that lady, but I'm sure with time they would have -- ha d we stayed there, something would 24 have happened. It was too dangerous. Much too dangerous. So one of -- one of her friend's husband -- the husband of one of her friends -- was that guid e and he was a member of the Communist Resistance. And he a nd his nephews and other people -- they were all local people -- they were smugglers, so they knew the moun tain extremely well. He -- he was involved in passing people. And so he had a group of four French who were -- well, two French and two Gypsies -- the Gypsies also were starting to be rounded up -- who were -- they were coming -- going from one place to the next in hiding. At ni ght they would walk in the fields. And they would stop in a farm or they would stop in a church. A lot of local priests, country prie sts, were also involved in helping out people like that. It didn't matter if they were -- if people were Jews or -- a lot of also were involved with pilots, who were shot down. And so they had -- they had like a chain, you see. And those organizations were very strong. Very, very st rong. They had to be ve ry -- very -- how can I say that -- they had to choose who they were passing because they could be betrayed very easily, and many of them were betrayed. Q: Were there other refugees living in this ? A: No. But amazingly e nough, after -- after we talked to othe r people, one of th e local people say "Oh, there is another Jewish family in hiding" -- I forgot where it was. So one day they were -- they came to visit us. And they were from Poland. Th ey were much younger than my parents. And they -- the wife was pregnant at the time . So I really don't know what happened to them. But -- but the people knew that they were -- and I'm sure that there were other peop le in hiding there also, see. Q: But you were pret ty free to move arou nd as you wanted? A: We were pretty free to move until the -- that zone became the red zone. And then y ou needed a special pass. And only the local people could get th at. So -- so actually, we didn't move, we were all in hiding. We couldn 't move. From January or February of '43 until the day we left in April the 9th of '43, we didn't move. We st ayed in the house cons tantly. Except going in the yard, you know. But my parents didn't. My pare nts were -- my parents were no t supposed to be there. Q: How aware were you of these different resistance operations in the area? 25 A: Not very much. Because we had no contact with anyb ody. And we found out when that -- that friend of ours -- of our -- our friend, the one who was hiding us -- when he sa id well, I'm taking you, and then he told us exactly what he was doing. And the whole chain of people who were doing that. So we had to -- to get through that -- those checkpoint. So the secretary of the mayor of a little village made those passes for us. And we were -- so we walked -- befo re we walked in the mountains and that was the last road before -- befo re getting in the mountain. And that road was patrolled heavily by the Germans, so we -- he was in the wine business, so we were hiding in the cellar there and his young boy was playing in the street and he was watching for the patrols. So we heard the patrol walking and the kid was playing and then he say "Okay." So we all cross the road one by one. And then we walked -- we started to walk up that mountain. And we walked for 24 hours. Q: How much preparation did you have for this journey? A: None. None. None. None. And in retrospect , it was absolutely crazy. How we made it, I don't know. Well, I know, because thos e four guides who came with us were very, very strong. And they were able to carry my mother on their back fo r part of the crossing. A nd my father almost died there in the mountain, of exhaustion. Because we walked 12 hours in the snow. Yes. Well, that saved us because the Germans had a -- had a -- like a small -- not chalet, but kind of portable, little -- little hut in the mountain. And the weather was so bad that -- before that -- that they had abandoned it. So we had to walk there in front of th at hut and nobody was there, but the Germans could see us from the valley because we saw, be fore we left, we saw people walking that same mountain and -- and was covered w ith snow on one side. And you could see, you know, the people walking up there. And the Germans were everywhere, everywhe re there. So when they saw us there they sent the and we were a few hour s ahead of them and by the time we reached the Spanish territory -- that part of Spain was controlled also by Sp anish guards and they arrested us. And they told us that because they arrested us the Germans couldn't do anything to us, 26 that the Germans were after th e people who were crossing the boarder in day to cross into Spanish territory to arrest people when there were Spanions (ph.) around. So we were arrested. Q: What was your plan at this time? You wanted to get to Spain. A: We had no plans. The plan was to go to Spain and then be there. And -- and -- and get away, again, to be one step ahead of the Germans. We just didn't know. We had absolutely no idea. All we wanted to do was be in Spain. Be away from the Germans. That's all. Q: So you were arrested by the Spanish guards -- A: Yes. Yes. Q. -- what happened next? A: Well, they took us to -- to the -- to the first village which was way up in the mountains. Way up. Way up. It was a tin y little place and they took us to the Mayor. They were not even in uniform. No, they had -- they had like -- well -- well, they ha d kind of -- of -- of milita ry habits. The rest of Spain at the time was so poor, so they had no uniform and their sh oes were in terrible shape. We were better dressed then th ey were. Coming from occupied France . And so they to ok us there. The Mayor greeted us and since my mother and my sister were there they were allowed to go sleep with people and he knocked on doors a nd he asked some ladies or some people, so my mother and my sister spent the night in a bed and then all the men, we were -- we were sent to a barn. And they still had a local pub open, a bistro. So we went there and we got drunk. I believe that was the first time in my life that I got drunk and while I sick, you kno w, we were celebrating. Those four French guys were so happy to be in Spain an d we had French money and they we re taking French money in that cafe and what a tab of white wine. And -- and the next day they took us to, that was already a city, Less (ph.). And from Less we took a bus to another place called Yella (ph.) and we spent a night in a hotel there and they told us that the next day we would walk like 30 or 40 jamata (ph.) and we walked, we went through a tunnel which was not finished yet. And the tunne l was being built by prisoners of pronco (ph.) people who were republicans. And -- and th e Spanish -- the Span ish -- the Spaniards 27 were very, very nice to us. Very nice. The director of that ca mp, , and he was showing the prisoners, they -- they were dressed like -- like prisoners with wood en shoes and so forth. He would say "See this one there and workin g with that wheel barrel. Well, he was a professor of philosophy and that one was an economist, " and stuff like that, "but they are bad people." Q: What's the name of this place? A: That place was . Yes. And that's the tunnel . It finally took them I don't know how many years to comp lete that. That was the only way that they could get in between France -- of in between and Sp ain. is -- is -- is Spanish. And it's -- it's separated form the rest of Spain, so during most of the winter it's so high in the mountains the path is covered with snow. So the only way th ey could get their -- thei r food and so forth was fr om France and that same road which was during -- in France -- passing in front of that house where we were in hiding would go all the way to Spain. That was the only -- the only road. That's why we have such a concentration of German there. That was the only road going to ____________. That was the name of that -- that boulder. And I went back there and the -- and the -- the Spaniards developed that into a -- a ski resort. And I didn't recognize any of the place except that that village where we spent that first night an d the village is ____________ abandoned. It's dead. Dead. All of the villages there are dead. They were just two or three people left. Q: So continue on your journey for. A: So -- so the we reach Lada (ph.), which wa s the -- the capitol of th e providence where we -- where we crossed and there they were assaulting people of the Geneva convention says that a neutral nation has to turn the citizens of nations at war w ith each other. I know Switzerland did that drastically. And -- and Spain, they didn't do that. They didn't do th at. So when we arrived in Lada an English pilot was there and they took care of the consul of -- it was -- I don't remember what it was. ____________ at the time it was really a very impressi ve car. Was there to pick him up in view of everybody. The -- the Span iards didn't care about that and so he was -- he was there and they took him to Barcelona and sure, and from ther e he was flown back to England and so we were 28 escorted out and -- and the people wh o were in between 18 and 40 were sent to jail and the governor told us "Well, I -- I know that when you crosse d the boarder and you gave your name and age and so forth, you all lied. You're a bunch of liars and now you have to tell the truth. And remember anybody who is in between 18 and 40 will go to jail." And the jail on top of that hill of Lada. And if people didn't get the message that they were not to be between 18 and 40 they were very stupid. And some -- some -- some were ve ry stupid and say "I'm 22." So -- so I got to be younger then I was. And my father was over 40 so he didn't have to lie. And we st ayed a couple of days in a hotel in Lada. And that was all paid. We didn't have -- by that time we were taken in charge by the French organization from Algir (ph.) and that -- that was it. We -- we -- they -- they -- they had -- they had -- they had -- the Canadian were there, the British of course, of course the U.S., people from Belgium, the Czech (ph. ), the Pols, and the jewish organization, the famous Doctor was there. He was the representative of the joint and people who were willing to go to the United States were getting an affidavit and -- and sent to the United States. Q: Where we you? A: Barcelona. Q: Oh, okay. I'm sorry. I thought you were still in Lada. A: No. No. No. Barcelona. Oh, no. No. We are still in Lada. So from Lada we were at that hotel already taken care of by the French organization and in lada they had -- that -- that -- governor would sort out and have the secretaries of his -- of his office get in touch with the people like us, French, people who were from Belgium, like __ __________ and all those pe ople didn't have to pay a penny. And then we were sent by train, we di dn't have to pay a penny either, to Barcelona and I remember the governor came to the station to greet us, gave us the tickets and food to -- to -- to eat on the train to go to -- to Barcelona. He was such a kind man. He was. He was. And, so when we got to Barcelona we had a bus waiting for us and that bus took us to a -- to ____________, meant ____________ in Barcelona where the French entities are like an embassy. And we would get there, we would be ___ _________ by them and a pi cture would be taken and they -- they -- they 29 had files on us and then they would say "Okay. You are assigne d to such hotel. You are assigned to such hotel," and so forth and once a week we were given, I don't re member how much money and cigarettes and shaving blades and stuff like that . And then if we didn't have clothes they would send us to a store and we would get clothes and stuff like that. So life was like that for three months. We -- until they organized a convoy. They had enough people to put us on a train and at the time we had to go to Portugal. So we went to Portugal. It lasted 36 hours and it was a -- a special train and the __________ __ between Spain and Portugal we would change trains because the gage are different and we went on -- on the Portages system. And the Portages were expecting us there and the ____________ with food and white bread and cigarettes and greetings and so forth and we went straight to Sitobow (ph.) and there in Sitobow e had two French cargo ships waiting, expecting us there. And two French Navy battle -- not battle ship, but patrol -- patrol boat. And we went to Casablanca. Q: How many people traveled with you other th an your family? Was this a big group? A: That was an enormous group. Absolutely en ormous. It was a full train and -- and two -- two --two boat loads was the ________ ____ and the ____ ________. Q: Several h undred people? A: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Maybe a thousand. Q: And were the other people travel ing with you from all over or -- A: Well -- Q. -- were they French? A. -- just -- no. No. No. No . No, they were from all over. All over. Because I remember one -- one -- one -- one of us was from C zechoslovakia (ph.) and he was able to enlist in the Czech legion. Some where from Belgium. Well, it was -- people who were allowed to land on allied territory. From, I suppose they checked on us which doesn't me an that some spies didn't -- were not able to infiltrate. We know that so me -- some of them did. And they were arrested. Q: Were all these people goi ng to Casablanca Jewish? 30 A: No. No. No. Oh, no. No, I would say the Je ws were about 20, 25 percent. That's all. Q: They were just people fleeing the war? A: Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. END OF TAPE 2 31 Tape Number 3 Q: what was that like? A: Well, it was like being born again. Casablanca was very, very busy and French flags everywhere. The French Navy wa s there; French uniforms. We saw the Americans for the first time. Q: When you say "first," what sens e are we talking about? We're not talk ing about . A: Visie (ph.), visie was irrelevant then. That -- that part of Fr ance had been liberated November '42 by -- by the British and the U.S. an d the French were there. Were ther e before the . They didn't fight because they were to far aw ay from -- from -- from the and their assignment was not to fight. Their main assignment was to defend the French colonies and they were essentially the French -- regular French Army. For two years or three th eir allegiance was to the government of Visie, but like an y Army in the world their allegiance was to their French government, but in terms of -- of the uniform, the discipline, the weaponry an d so forth, they were the -- they were the French Army, the French Navy, the French Airforce. They -- they -- they never, never knew any other chain of command or -- or -- or -- knew orders and what came from the French government. Q: With . A: Until November '42, but -- Q: . A: Yes, but -- but -- I'm talking of July '43. Th at's when we landed in Casablanca and Visie was history in North Africa. Visie was hist ory. We had . They had a parliament, the beginning of a parliament and the goal was working very hard to become the -- the -- what was its title -- chief of the provisional government. And the goal was in North Africa at the time, I saw the for the first time in my life in -- in Casablanca in July '43. So Visie was history. Visie was history. I don't know if the -- the seal, the French republic was totally reestablished, but all the laws of Visie by then had been totally, tota lly abolished. Totally, totally. 32 Q: So what were you're -- what were your plans? What were you planning on doing once you got to Casablanca? ? A: Oh, no. No. No . So -- so -- so the plans we re -- was to enlist in the army and my father was too old to be -- to be in the active, active duty, but he got drafted as a civilian and they needed people with his specialty, so they are finding to the maintenance of the ai r base in Casablanca there which was essentially French and American. And my sister went to school. She was 14. And they were assigned a small apartment which wa s nice and my mother became invo lved with that association of a group of people who came lik e within, from France and Spai n and -- which be came a very profiting group because many high ra nking officials took the same oath that we did and, so they -- they had a like -- like a big headqu arters and they took over a big hot el in Casablanca. A very nice hotel and they had like - it was like a home for the soldiers who were comi ng on leave or people who were going through Ca sablanca. They had a big cafeteria. They had social services and so forth and my mother got very heavy invo lved with that. And of course they were , so and then I was in the Army. French , second French. Second division an d so we stayed there until April of '44 and then we were shipped over to England and then Au gust the 1st of '4 4 we landed in Normandy and, so actually Normandy and liberation of Paris and the , it's awful. Q: I'm just side tracking a minute. In Morocco we talked about -- were -- were your parents part of a Jewish community or was it just a French -- A: No. No. No. No. No. They -- th e American Jews didn't help us at all. We were asked in . They were actually . And they didn't help us. The help came from the French. The French in Morocco use their . Truly anti-Semites. Ex tremely, extremely violently rabid or where nice French people who couldn 't care less. Who just couldn 't care less. And I know my parents were very happy in Morocco. Very happy. Q: Did they resume -- well, yo u weren't very religious before, but was there any observance of recognition of being Jewish again? A: Oh, yes. Yankapor ( ph.), Basa (ph.) an d stuff like that, yes, yes. 33 Q: And within the French Army was there an y distinction about being Jewish or not? A: That -- that -- that French Army, that's a differe nt chapter. Well, well, very -- how can I say that -- we were a very large number of Jewish boys there. Very large. And that's where we found raw, virulent anti-Semitism. All the way from the top down -- from the top down. From the very high-ranking officer down. Yes. Q: How did that manifest itself? A: Oh, by discriminatio n, bad assignments, Jew-baiting, fist-fights. Yes. Yes. Q: Did that surprise you? A: Yes. Yes. I was not prepared for that, at first. But after th at, okay, I took it for granted. And we were enough Jewish boys to stick together. But it was not fun, it was not fun. We felt very, very different. Very diff erent. Yes. Q: It would seem that after all your travails to finally arrive in Morocco and think that you were free and then have to contend with this -- A: Yes. Yes. Yes. Q: What was the general spirit of the Armed Forces going back into Europe to help end the war? A: Well, basically, for mo st of the people it was the feeling that they were doing what they were meant to do. But not everybody was like that, because many of the soldiers of the 2nd French Armored Division were drafted in North Africa. We had a large cont ingent of Arabs from Algeria. Many of them couldn't speak a word of French. And didn't feel that they had to fight the Germans. I don't blame them, you know. An d after a while, when some of the young men who were drafted in North Africa so that the young French men who were liberated didn' t try to join the Army or they had done nothing to liberate themselves, they say "Why are we dying for them ?" We were perfectly happy in our cities of Algeria and for what, you know. So , I remember one of my friends. He's dead now, the poor guy. But after Paris, after th e liberation of Paris, we were on the road going east, and it was the beginning of fa ll, and the liberation of Paris ha d been -- how can I say that -- you know, the first two days were great. Then after that we dealt with a population which had 34 survived four years of occupation. And most of those people who ha d survived those four years of occupation had survived by surviving. Which mean s -- I wouldn't say illegal means but the French, they have a word for th at. They call that ________ or ________. You surv ive. So they had a mentality that was very, very difficult to accept. So on that road he told me "Well, we are not volunteers anymore." And th at's the way we felt. At least, that's the way I felt. I was not a volunteer anymore. And th e enthusiasm, the sense of victory that we felt in Normandy and getting into Paris had vanished totally. Two weeks in Paris, that was the end of it. That was the end of it. Just being in contact with those people in Paris -- Q: So at that point what were yo u going to do? What did you think? A: Oh, well, I kept going on. I was enlisted -- I voluntee red for the duration. So -- and we still had a job to do. But we didn't feel like the superhero, or Superman or what. So just, okay, let's finish that and go back home. That was the feeling. Then after, when it was all over, you know, first thing first, I got among th e first to be discharged when it was over. And I want my un iform in a closet nevermore. Q: A: Yes. Q: Where else did you fight? A: That's all. Q: After Paris -- A: Yes. Q: --you were just in th e Army but not fighting it? A: Oh, yes. We went -- we went all the way to Alsace. Oh, yes. Q: And then after France was liberated, then you decided to stay in France? A: When I was discharged? Q: When were you discharged? 35 A: August the 13th, 1945. That's 50 year s ago, two days ago. Q: So from liberation of Fran ce, which was in 1944 through 1945, were you fighting elsewhere? A: After the end of the campaign in Alsace, we went back into France -- into the center of France. That was in March of '45. March, '45. And I got a -- my first -- my parents were ba ck in France by then. They came back in February. And so I got a leave to see them. And I went back to England. They had some outfit there taking care of the liquid ation of what had been the Free French to get back into the regular Army. And what essentially was loafing. But gave me the opportunity to come back by plane, which was fun. Not too many people were flying. Q: So when did you resume your li fe after all of this interruption? A: Three days after I got discharged, went back to school to finish my b accalaureate. And after that, I went to medical school. Q: And all this was in France? A: All that was, yes. The Paris area. But medical school wa s in Paris, yes. Q: You had basically deci ded to stay in Paris? A: Yes, oh, yes. Yes. Yes. The only thing was that we were invo lved with Israel at the time, you see. And they -- what was it called -- I forgot what it was called. But they were looking for Jewish war veterans to help the Hagana (ph.). So we were like -- like --s ome of my friends were working with the Exodus. Mostly those who had been in those macquis, Jewish macquis. Some were forging papers and stuff like that. And others were carrying weapons. So we were all more or less involved like that. Arnold went back to Israel because he was in the Jewish brigade, so he -- and they didn't want him, they sent him back. They had too many pe ople. They had too many people coming from all over the world. Q: What were you doi ng to make a stand? A: I was -- for a few months I was working with a group which was called _____ ______. Which was, essentially, working for aviation. And the -- they were heavily recruiting pilots from World War II. British, Americans -- from all over. People that had been in the Air Force of their 36 countries. And the French had a llowed the Jewish Agency -- that's the name of it -- to use several airports there, so that's what we were doing. Help ing with that. Taking flying lessons, also. I met a lot of characters there. That's wh en I met my first -- the first Indian Jew from India. I didn't know that they had Jews in India at the time -- and was a pilot and I met also a pilot of the Royal Air Force and a German crew who came -- they wanted to erase what Germany had done during the war. They came and they had their log book from World War II showing their missions and how good they were. And of course th ey were turned down. They were crushed. "But we have done nothing against the Jews, and we want to he lp. And we are good pilots." Yes. Q: What did you discov er about the French attitudes after the war? A: Oh, well, everybody was trying to get -- well, France had been heavily destroye d during World War II. Many, many cities had b een really destroyed. A lot of Fr ench people had been maimed or killed. More than a million prisoners of war came back and had to re-adjust to life. So we were all in the same boat, re-adjusting to life. And I had been -- I wouldn't say immunized, but being exposed to a different kind of anti-Semitism that I had experienced before as a teenager, this time I was -- my skin was thicker. So going to medical school I found the same attitude. Same attitude. At that -- "Too many Jews are in medical school. Too many Jews are doct ors" and et cetera, et cetera. So I went through medical school and di dn't have too many problems. And I started my practice. I had my own practice for ten years. Q: What kind of practice? A: Oh, general practitioner. I was a general practitioner. And in the '60s, anti-Semitism started to be more targeted. It was not ju st a general uneasiness. People were being targeted as Jews. And not ____________________. They were -- how can I say that? You were shown that you were different. French society was star ting to really become nationalistic. And my understanding of that situation was that the most virulent collaborators and traitors of World War II, who had been sentenced to death or long jail period or even li fe sentence, through amnesty and so forth, all of a sudden were back in the streets. And I recognized a few of them in Paris, because Paris is a village 37 and you know everybody. And with them coming out in the streets -- back -- and having as much power as before. Somebody like Bousceau (ph.), who signed the agreements which allowed the French police to be after us an d without those agreements the Germans would have been unable to arrest five Jews in France. Bousceau had a brill iant career, and he was a friend of _________. He was a friend of ___________. And many of them, many of them who -- so their attitude about the Jews -- they didn't want to kill the Jews, no. No. But their attitude about the Jews was the traditional attitude of France, which means that the Jew -- whatever you do -- you cannot be French. You cannot be French. To be French your ancestry has to be -- you have to have a French name. You have to be a ______, you have to be a _______, you have to be -- no, if your name is Bloom or Bloch or Levy, it doesn't matter if you have lived in France as long as and it doesn't matter, you are not French. You are not French. It doesn't matter if you lost a leg, if your father died in Verdun, it doesn't matter. How can you be French? You ca n be French a little bit if you convert to Catholicism. Then okay, you are -- th ings are better. But if your father or your grandfather was a Russian Jew or a Polish Jew, even if you change your name, even if you get to be a priest, you are still a Jew. Like -- what's his name -- the bishop of Paris. He's still Jewish. So -- Q: Did you sense that th e French were angry at the Jews for the war? A: No. No. No. Not the people who think clearly. No. The French anti-Sem itism is really looking at the Jew as a foreign el ement. And when you look at Fr ench history for a period of -- going back to the 1300's until the 1800's -- for more than five hundred years the Jews had absolutely no impact in French history. They didn't exist p hysically in France. And they had absolutely no impact. And when they started to have an impact on French history, it was essentially in the realm of banking and big money. And that 's why the Jews are associated with money, because that's when they became prominent. And it' s now that they are in science and medicine and so forth. -- -- Q: . 38 A: -- and medicine and so forth. So -- so -- so -- and the Catholic religion had always that teaching of the Jew killed quite. The Jew is -- and the Jewish religion which is inferior to Christianity and it's -- it's -- and all the symbols of the cathedral and -- and in France. All of the cathedrals have one -- one of those with culture depict ing the Jews as evil or -- or punished from their sins, so it's really ingrained and it doesn't seem that necessary that they -- that they will condom the king of the Jews. Not at all. But Jew has to know which is his place or her place in French society. Q: Do you feel differe ntly about being a French Jew after the war than you had before? Did it change your perception? A: Oh, yes, of course. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh, ye s. Yes, because since -- since the end of the war -- see the French population before the war was about 300,000 Jews. Most of those Jews were of falling origin and first genera tion. And, so they were es sentially -- they were not -- not merchants. All -- all -- if they were merchants they were people who were people who were working in the market place. You know, they -- they -- they were -- they were really -- their -- their social -- the -- the -- economically and -- and -- and socially the Jews that we knew were, I wouldn't say "poor," but they were really at the bottom. They were at the bottom. And after the war we had a big influx of Jews from -- from eastern Europe from Nort h Africa and -- and the second generation or third generation of -- of the Jews born to Russian immigrants or Polish immigrants because the school system is so open went to higher education and all of a sudden they are engineers or . They are high er ranking members of that corporation, of the other corporation and it creates a lo t of resentment. A lot of resentment. A lot. A lo t. It creates a lot of resentment also in the Jewish community becau se of the inter-marria ges, because of the conversions. It -- it -- it seemed -- see, it's a very, very difficult situation. Very, very difficult situation. Q: So is this what motivated you to leave? 39 A: Well, what -- what motivated me to leave was the feeling that I didn't want to be on -- on the continent where that continent is essentially a enormous burden place for -- for -- for -- for the Jews and the Jewish culture. Over -- over the centurie s they have totally destroyed our -- our -- our culture. And I -- I felt that coming to the United State it's totally different because the United States -- all the culture excepted all the cu ltures, blend. It's th e only place in the world that I know where you go to a church which on -- on -- on -- on -- on Saturday it's a synagogue and you have several around here. It's the only place in the world where you go to a buff et for a Sunday brunch and they serve bagels and Matzo. I saw that in Pittsburgh . On Sunday I went down , Sunday brunch, bagels and lox and so forth and Matzo. And everybody knows what Matzo is . In France or England or a place -- any place like that it was unheard and heard. it's th e only place that I know where on Christmas the Jews are working for the Christians, so they can stay home and celebrate. It's -- it's -- and it's the only place that I know where anti-Semitism was maybe of fervent as in France 50 years ago. And I remember World War II and I remember talking to Jewish -- Jewish GIs and what they were -- what -- what they were pu tting up with was abso lutely similar to what we were putting up with. I saw them when I was in England before th e end of the war the Jewi sh -- Jewish -- they had, you know, Jewish -- like a restaurant an d so forth. Jewish and we we re comparing notes and -- but now it's totally different. Totally differ ent. I'm not saying that it's a perfect world. There's no perfect world, but at least there is an effo rt made here to -- anti-Semitism is considered as an illness. It's not part of society. Q: What year did yo u come over here? A. '64. Q: Was the adjustment difficult at all when you came over here? A: No. No. No. No. The -- the only thing was the language, bu t I had the delusion that I spoke English and -- and I rapidly understood that I had to make majo r efforts to -- Q: Did all of this strengthen your se nse of religion? 40 A: Well, if -- if -- if you -- if you mean the religion by going to synago gue, the ritually and so forth, no. No. No. No, but -- but the sense of Judaism I always had and -- and -- and -- and I make a separation, in my mind at least, because I was ra ised in a nontraditional -- I wouldn't say "not religious," no. My parents were religious, but they didn't follow the ritual . They -- they -- they didn't eat kosher. They didn't do this. They didn't do that. But -- but the sense that -- that -- the deep sense of -- of Judaism, we ha ve. I feel that's -- that's much more important than -- than -- than, you know, repeating a prayer just because it's a prayer. So that's -- that's what I'm trying to -- to -- to -- to follow everyday. Q: What sort of long te rm impact do you think that all of these experiences during the war still have on you today? A: That -- there is such thing as fate. That things don't happen just like coincidence. That there is fate. There is -- there is -- like gears working toge ther and I know if -- if that didn't -- that was not the case for us I don't kno w how we would have been able to survive. It's a very strange feeling and that, in spite of fate, fate is not blind. You have to help yourself also. That's the most important step. That -- that -- you are responsible for what happened to you if you don't know how to read the signs around you and that you have to do. You cannot expect somebody else to do for you and I believe that's very Jewish. Q: Do you believe in destiny? A: No. No. No. Q: . A: Okay. Q: . A: Oh, okay. Conclusion of interview.
