In Lokiec the people could not pronounce it because the spelling is, was L-O-K-I-E-Lokiec-C. And so I sent, I took my father™s first name. I didn™t know where he was killed and where he was taken. I have no idea. And perhaps you would know, if you were able to tell me. Perhaps. I don™t know. And so Œ Q: When did you do this, when did you take your father™s name? When did you change your name? A: When I think when I became an American. Carol : Yes, when he became a naturalized citizen in the court at that same time. Q: Wonderful. What was it like to become an American citizen?

I slept in the seminary too. So I lived there and Œ Q: Tell me how you met your wife. A: Ok my wife came to the seminary for her book. She was in college. She had, a book of Jewish, what is it, Jewish Carol : In folklore. At Indiana University and I was home for the holidays. A: So she came into the seminary our seminary, the Jewish Theological Seminary was famous for two big libraries. So she came, but she came too late in the evening. 6:00 is when they closed already. So she was in the telephone booth to call home and I stayed there and so I came over to her and said can I help? And she told me about it. I say oh this book, I have it. Carol : Very conveniently.

Said right away that you have to give it back. I will give it back to him. Carol : I™ll mail it back to him. She was horrified that I should go into some strange, as she said Interview with Marc Samuels 33 July 25, 2014 strange man™s room but I figured with a rabbinical student and at the seminary how fearful do I have to be and he did have the book that I needed . Those were different , different days I™d say. Q: How long were you together before you got married? A: I think as soon as I saw her. Carol : And we met during the so called Christmas vacation and then we were engaged in November and we married in Ap ril. Q: Of what year was this? Carol : 1957 is when we were married. Q: Wonderful. A: Carol remembers better than I. Carol: I do and also I don™t know how much detail you want but when he came to New York he had no means of self -support so, beside this small amount of UNRHA money and so he took a room in some poor little area, one of these funny hotels, shabby looking hotels and he got a job as an usher in a movie theater. You know the guy with a uniform and a flashlight. That was the only thing he could do cause he didn™t know any English so when people heard about him, people at the Seminary heard about him, they took him in right away. And that™s how he was saved. He was an excellent student and he Œ A: I was seven years there. Carol: Yes and he is one of the more well I shouldn™t say one of the more, but there are different categories of rabbis just as there are doctors and physicians and professors. And he was one of the top, very top students and one of the few students. Interview with Marc Samuels 34 July 25, 2014 A: I allowed my wife back. Carol: Well you deserve it. Q: So then you moved to Westchester. Is that what happe ned? A: No I had several, several positions. Q: Where else did you work? A: Carol, my wife will remember that better. Carol: Well these were not positions. These were , Marc taught the children of some well to do wealthy families and he would commute to Westchester and two of these children were Marc was i t Jan Peerce. Jan Peerce™s children. Their brother in law, Jan Peerce and the other Jewish cantor and also there was a doctor, a physician and Marc taught their children too. A: My wife™s memory is better than mine. Q: And then you stayed in New York for how long? A: New York, Carol. Carol: Yes, we didn™t stay in New York. We only stayed in New York as long as Mar c needed in order to finish school cause we married in April and graduation was going to be in June. So we rent ed sublet an apartment from one of the students who was going off to England. We stayed there and then Marc got a job in Midland, Michigan. And so Œ A: That™s my first job. Interview with Marc Samuels 35 July 25, 2014 Carol: So that™s where we went. A: I was a rabbi. Q: You were a rabbi, ok. A: I was a rabbi there. Carol: That was his first job. And we went off to Midland. Q: And then you stayed in Michigan how long. Carol: Three years. Q: And then where did you go? A: Because in the rabbinate you first you don™t get the congregation. And then you go up and up. Q: And then where did you go after that? Carol: We went to Charlotte, North Carolina. And we had two children there. We had a baby in Midland. We had two in Charlotte and then we moved afterwards, not directly afterwards I think or maybe it was directly afterwards, we had a daughter. We had four children and the daughter was born in Pennsylvania, Washington, Pennsylvania. Q: And now you™re in Massachusetts . Carol: Yes, but we were in Connecticut before we came to Massachusetts. A: M y wife™s memory is better than mine. Interview with Marc Samuels 36 July 25, 2014 Q: Can I ask you some general questions. What are your thoughts now about Germany. Do you have any special feelings about Germany? A: Yes, I have no feelings at all for them. Because Œ Carol: But they™re Israel™s best friend now. Well he went Œ A: I have other things to think about. Carol: No, but you do think of the Holocaust all the time. Q: Well that was going to be my next question. Do you think about the war years and the Holocaust? A: Yes, yes, yes. Carol: All the time. A: How can you be without them. I will say the seminary, the Jewish Seminary was so nice to me, very nice to me. Although in the beginning, as a student, the students, the men they take me in. Now I had a good background. I already then, I knew Talmud before all the things. Q: Have you been to Israel? A: Oh yes. Several times. Carol: His one brother survived, the oldest brother, the oldest sibling, Moshe. He married a very lovely Jewish Russian woman and they had two children and we went to visit them so that™s the only family he had left. Interview with Marc Samuels 37 July 25, 2014 Q: And where did his brother live? I n Israel? Carol: Yes he lived, after the war he settled in Holon , H-O-L-O-N. And we visited them . Q: So that™s the only relative you have on your side? Carol: The immediate relative yes. There are a few little cousins here and there. Second cousins. I know first cousins maybe. A: No I think I have a first cousin. Carol: Yes, Mietic . A: Mietic, he™s still living, I don™t know. Carol: Yes and also there™s another cousin who was in politics in Russia. Q: Have you been back to Poland at all? A: I w as in Sachenau was it the ninth. Carol: Yes, my son took us to, took us and my oldest son the four of us went to Poland. To see Marc™s city and we saw his house which is in very good condition on this square, this market area which is now I don™t know trees or something like this. We went to see documents at the city hall. And we went to Krakow and we went to where was your mother born, Korogel or something like that. A: Korgel . Interview with Marc Samuels 38 July 25, 2014 Carol: Yeah, Korgel. And we went let™s see where else. Oh Warsaw. There is a big building where the main synagogue was. I don™t know. It was like cars or car repairs, but a very elegant large building. And then that was the beginning of the ghetto. But the ghetto of course was torn down and rebuilt. They have seen built buildings, houses where people lived . But it was right there , right near the synagogue. Q: When your children were growing up, did you tell them about what happened to you and your experiences ? Did you talk about it a lot with your children? A: I don™t remember . Carol: No he did not because if we did say anything or I would say something, he would just brush us off and say well I™ll give you some books to read. You can read about it because it was too difficult for him to face. And this is why he didn™t write any books about his experience . And that™s why we™re so glad to be able to talk to you or somebody so that some of his, some of their understanding can rub off and they™ll be a little more knowledgeable. Q: Do you think you would have been a different person today if you hadn™t gone through what you went through? A: I don™t know. I prepared myself. I was known. My father with a few other people did, brought special teachers, specialty for me because for me and a few other people, because we wanted to. And Œ Q: You™re talking about the studies? A: Yes, I, in addition we studied beyond the normal that children go. We went a little higher in situation. Q: Do you think you are more religious because of what you lived through? Interview with Marc Samuels 39 July 25, 2014 A: No, no. I was more religious before. Carol: But you were younger too. A: Yes I was younger too. I have the Jewish garb. A Yiddish yetl , a kapote , you know. Do you know what that is. Q: When you were raising your children, what kind of religious background did they have. A good one I™m sure. Carol: We sent them to day school. Q: Jewish day school. Carol: But the day school we sent them Harriet Academy in Springfield, Massachusetts was very poor quality and then they went to high school. Oh yes my oldest son went to a good day school. Yes, Marc used to schlep them back and forth Œ A: Maimonides. Carol: T o Maimonides here in Brookline back and forth. They™d come home Friday afternoon and then go back Sunday night. They b oarded with a family and it was expensive but we were happy for them to go. So Œ Q: What brought you to Brookline? A job? Carol: No. you want me to talk or should I have him talk? A: You talk. Interview with Marc Samuels 40 July 25, 2014 Carol: Ok. The children when they graduated from high school they got into Brandeis and one son went to the University of Connecticut. So when they were at Brandeis they made friends of course and they, that was where they settled and they just felt at ho me and why else would they go somewhere else. They felt. And then why else would where™d we go. So we settled in Brookline also for the same reason. Cause we have four grandchildren now. And so it doesn™t make sense to go off to California or something. Q: Do you remember the Eichmann trial, and if so what your thoughts were during that? A: I am, I have been a reader of newspapers, even I still was in Ciechanów as a young boy. I remember that the director from the school Rabbi Ava Keremon was , lived next door to me, to us. So and I was a reader and on one can read some Hebrew and he couldn™t make out one word. He came to me and asked me and he was the principal of the school like a . Carol: And Marc speaks fluently in Hebrew from his early education. Q: You think about your war time experience very frequently? Are there any Œ A: Yes. Carol: Constantly. Q: Are there any sounds or sights or smells that bring it back, that sometimes make you think about Auschwitz or Golleschau? A: No, no. Carol: No, if you read something Marc you have a tendency to have a bad dream. That happens cause it remind him. A: That™s some of the Holocaust. I lost my whole family. Interview with Marc Samuels 41 July 25, 2014 Carol: Interestingly there was a fellow in his house, his house where he was living before he was taken away by the name of Leventhal, Zalman Leventhal. And it™s strange by coincidence this fellow became a Sondercommander at Auschwitz. I think he was in charge of putting dead bodies into the crematorium. And this is a fellow that Marc te mporarily went to school with. But eventually he was murdered and then also he wrote a lot of information. I don™t know if it™s a lot of information. But he wrote information and hid it around the concentration camp. So he must have left a little bit of a legacy but it can be seen and there™s a mention of this Zalman Leventhal in the Auschwitz album. I don™t know if you know about that. It™s a book. So there™s a mention of Zalman so it was a coincidence. He lived in the same house as Marc in the A: And I had another thing to say, to write about him. He™s the one who convinced me to go to yeshiva and of the garon , you know what garon is. Q: The garon, yeah. A: After yeshiva which was lahonum vashenem , the famous, a famous big, and the lahonum vashenem, I went there to yeshiva. They took me in and one of the people there came over to me. And can you please do me a favor. I said, what, of course rabbi . I need ink to write. I says I™ll go out and get ink. And then I got homesick. I went home. I left and a few months after that lahonum vashenem was killed. And then that™s another story. Q: have you been to the Holocaust museum in Washington. Carol: Yes, we were there Marc. A: We were there. Q: And have you been to Yad Vashem in Israel? Interview with Marc Samuels 42 July 25, 2014 Carol: No I d on™t think when we were there. There™s a more recent building perhaps. I don™t know. Maybe we did. I think we did, I think we did. A: Yad Vashem. Q: Is there anything else you wanted to talk about that we haven™t covered. Anything that you might Œ A: I might. I don™t know. Carol: There™s one thing. It™s not important but it seems that there are certain people who were better liked than other people. I mean not that there was anything unlikeable about these other people. But maybe they thought they wou ld have a better chance at surviving. And Marc was very weak and so he was in this, what they called a hospital. But it wasn™t and there was no medicine or care. But this Dr. Rusa was in charge and he called Marc and told him to please come in and he would help take care of him. And so then he came to Marc. I don™t know how many days later, a few days later maybe, and said Marc get ready to leave because the guards are going to come and make a selection. A: That was in camp. Carol: Yes, that™s right that was in camp and so they quickly hustled Marc out of there and then of course the guards picked out whoever they wanted. A: That was in Golleschau. Carol: That helped Marc to survive, to have friends. And I get by with my little friends. A: I had a lot of friends too, there. Carol: With help from his friends. Interview with Marc Samuels 43 July 25, 2014 Q: Are there any other stories you want to tell about like about your friends in Golleschau. A: You go home and suddenly you know to be ready tell us Œ Q: I wanted to ask you. Did they build, was a ghetto built in your town? When the Germans came in. A: No. Q: No, there was no ghetto. Ok. A: No you know but most people lived in our house because they put in families in addition to our own families. We only had three rooms and they put in neighbors because they took the , they take for themselves. Carol: And by the way Schindler™s list and sometimes there might, probably are other movies which touched on the Holocaust. That you saw the prisoners eating. Now Marc says that nobody sat down. They weren™t allowed to sit down while they ate. They all had to stand around and eat. But that just goes to show the inhumanity of these people. They were sadist. They were very sadistic. They were pathological murderers and criminals. They were sociopaths and psychopaths. And this is the existence they had to live among. These crazy hateful people. A: I had, Jewish people, very nice people that were my friends. All the nice people were friends. Carol: But as a matter of fact, an interesting also an interesting situation is especially during the war when we were married at the end of the 50s, we didn™t know whether to buy German products or not. A lot of Jews were not doing it. In fact I even came across som eone recently who won™t buy at Trader Joe. I don™t™ know if you have a Trader Joe in your neighborhood. They will not buy a British, German goods and so Marc said that well the state of Israel buys its buses and trucks and a lot of their Volkswagens from G ermany so not that he was suggesting that we Interview with Marc Samuels 44 July 25, 2014 not buy from Germany. But it seems to be that that phase is over now. And Germany is one of Israel™s good friends. They don™t have very many friends in Europe any more, or even in China. There is a lot of anti-Semitism. And so Œ A: I get that sub Œ Carol: Yes, Marc said that Germany didn™t suffer enough. The Germans didn™t suffer enough. And they didn™t. They just walked home after the war. Only a few of them were hung at the Eichmann trial and a few other p laces . But they didn™t suffer enough. A: Of course you know they all committed suicide. Q: Tell me the names of your children and grandchildren. Carol: You want to tell her. A: You have better Œ Carol: Ok our oldest son™s name is Steven. I know this is a Christian name which is a popular name among Jews because there are so many Shmuels around and so we, since our last name was Samuels, and Marc wanted to call him Samuel, Samuels. That™s what his name wou ld have been. I said nothing doing. He said I hate you when he gets older for naming him Samuel Samuels, although it strangely enough Marc was, my son Steve was helping out, he was an assistant to a librarian at Brandeis and he came across the name Samuel Samuels. Then he came across the middle initial S in the middle. Samuel S Samuels. And then eventually he found out that the guy™s name was Samuel, Samuel, Samuels. That doesn™t even sound possible but he wasn™t joking either. But I refused to name him Samuel with the last name of Samuels. So we called him Steven for that reason. And then Steven. Jonas which was the brother who was killed in Auschwitz, who gave him this crust of bread, gave Marc this crust of bread and then was killed. And then, oh ye s he was Interview with Marc Samuels 45 July 25, 2014 beaten up and they took his boots away. I don™t know if Marc mentioned that to you. Took his boots away and then they beat him up. And then he was gassed or whatever they do. Q: This was a friend of Marc™s. Carol: No this is Marc™s brother. Q: Oh Marc™s brother. No he didn™t say that. Carol: Yes. Steve™s middle name is Jonas or Yona after his brother. A: He was murdered in Auschwitz. Q: And your other children™s names. Carol: Oh yes, oh that™s right. So that Steven Jonas Samuels. And Jon athan Gabriel Samuels. Gabriel was my grandfather™s name. Jonathan sounds like Jonas and so I kind of snuck that in cause you are not supposed to give the same name to your children. So in Johan™s time. Then David. I always liked the name David. It™s jus t the ultimate Jewish name. I feel the Jewish , the most meaningful Jewish name I think. So David Michael. Since Jonathan™s middle name is Gabriel. I have one angel. I named David, David Michael, the other angel. And then Debby is Marc™s, Marc™s mother. Deborah, Devora. So she has the name of Devora. Let™s see. A: She™s a professor in the college, in Wheelock college here. Carol: Yes, Wheelock College . She just came back from Italy and she was also in Munich teaching the Holocaust. This is her second trip in the course at Wheelock College. It was highly interesting and she got a lot of students to go with her. Q: Have you worked? Interview with Marc Samuels 46 July 25, 2014 Carol: I personally. No because I was filled with kids and also there were a lot of synagogue things I had to go to. All the bar mitzvahs and the Hadassah and the Sisterhood, and the Sisterhood board, the Hadassah board. And this goes on and on. People who invite you which is very nice but enough is enough. So I didn™t, but I did go to school at night. I didn™t go to, I didn ™t graduate college because my parents just didn™t have the money. My father was divorced and their parents were divorced so they had their separate families. So it took me about ten years or more, 12 years to get my bachelor™s degree at the University of Pittsburgh when we were in Washington, Pennsylvania. And then we moved and so we were in the Springfield area. And I went to the University of Massachusetts and I finished my degree. Oh yes, I got a degree from the University of Pittsburgh in English and I got a master of arts in teaching at the University of Massachusetts which is now a very good state school. And then I had nothing to do when we went to Connecticut. Willimantic Connecticut, Emanuel center. So I got another degree, a bachelor of fine arts this time in graphic design. So I™ve kept myself busy at night but not to get too involved with his work. Q: Is there anything else, a message to your grandchildren, Marc, that you would like to give or anything else you wanted to say before we close? A: Grandchildren, they™re very young now. Carol: Nobody is really interested in becoming a rabbi and not only that but we™re very disappointed that they don™t even take books out of this very large library. Marc donate more than 1500 books to the University of Connecticut, where he taught by the way and we still have over about 1600 books left right now in our very small apartment. So we really don™t know what to do about that. So we have one of the largest book collections that any Judaica library has. And it™s called the Rabbi Marc E. Samuels Judaica collection. Yes. So they™re not interested for some reason. Of course they™re very young now. But they probably will be interested later on but we sti ll don™t know what to do with them. We moved into assisted living. Interview with Marc Samuels 47 July 25, 2014 Q: Well thank you very much for doing this interview and I just have a few closing words I wanted to say. And so if you could just wait one moment, unless there™s something else you want ed to add. Is there anything else you wanted to add or do you feel you™ve said Œ Carol: Yes, about Germany today. Years ago Marc mentioned the fact that the Germans of today are not necessarily the way they were or not the same country as it was. And th at you can™t blame Germany, German people today at least most of them. There™s always anti -Semites around. That you can™t get mad at them. They had nothing to do with it. But the fact that they are supportive of Israel is a very good, it™s a good sign. Now they™re pretty sick and tired of the Bittegoodmachen [ph] I think it™s called giving all this money away as a pension. Q: Do you get money from Germany? A: I do. Q: You do, you still do? A: Yes. And Œ Q: How do you feel about that? A: No. I, they took money from me. I came to Washington with some money put into my body, hidden and then they took it everything. Now Œ Carol: They took his father gave each child money. I don™t know how much it was, like about $200 or something like that. A: I don™t know. Carol: And Œ- Interview with Marc Samuels 48 July 25, 2014 A: I got 500 Œ Carol: Like it was folded up and put into their behind, in their rectum and that™s how they hid it and for the girls they gave extra money. But when they got to the camps there was no way that they could hide it anymore. And it was useless anyway. You couldn™t buy your way out. They™d kill you anyway, after taking the money. Q: Those are all important stories. I just wanted to thank you for doing the interview and we will close now by my saying this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview of Marc Samuels. A: I want to mention one, one thing more. It™s not about me but I was present, eyewitness to it. There was a family. He went to the Geresh Tebel [ph] here. He was an Orthodox person and he and - Carol: Did you lose your train of thought? A: Yes, yes. Don™t take for granted that this is all I have to say. Yeah. Q: Thank you again for doing the interview. Let me just repeat that this concludes the interview of Marc Samuels. A: Ok. (end)
