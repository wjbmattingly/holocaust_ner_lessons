I said Professor, I want to be a lawyer. You know what does it mean to be a lawyer. It means...a lawyer means to be twenty-four hours a day a lawyer. So said Professor, how could it be? Even a lawyer has to sleep a little. Yes. This is exactly what I wanted to tell you, that in your dreams, you dream about the mistakes you've done this day and don't repeat it the next day. This is a lawyer, 4and when I...several times he asked me a nd you know and it is very difficult. It's very...so he said are you sure you want to be lawyer. I said yes, Professor.

So then he takes out from his drawer my thesis, and he hands it over and I see there was written excellent and I (laughing) remember the thesis was _____ and _____ in the Roman and Russian War. (Laughter) It was in 1933. So then he says are you sure you want to be lawyer. Tomorrow come to my office and you'll work w ith me, and this was in 19...by the end of 1933 because in order to work as a lawyer, you had to to have six months preparatory in the court, but then in '39, the Lithuanian mini ster of justice, he was not...let's say Nazis and the Nazis themselves, and he picked out my professor and myself and they didn't allow any Jews to be uh to be accepted in cour t even like practitioners, but I was lucky. I was a member of the ________, a member of the _______ movement and there was in relations, permanent relations with the Lithuanian National Sports Club ________, and the man of ____ was a...also at the faculty of law, ________, and he graduated the very same month like I.

I take the risk. 5So I I worked with him for a half a year in the...in the...in this...in the civil court and only then it was I could start practicing at Professor Belaski's office. You understand. And here again Professor Belaski was a great, a gr eat Jewess. In addition, he was a man of esprit, of talent, of of spirit. He he he...in addition to writing his monumental works on civil war that a generation was educated on his books, he wrote also a book, The Man and His Destiny, and this is certain jokes, certain seriously about the man and his destiny.

And he defended them. He defended them and he explained it clearly. He he...what he told me a lawyer must be twenty-four hours a lawyer. If somebody goes wrong...have done in justice to somebody, you have to defend. 6Every...a murderer has a right to get defense. A lawyer should defend him, for the for the court is to decide whether he is guilt or not guilty, but he has the right to defense, and the same goes for the Communists. Q: Avraham, tell me...we were talking about wr iting and how he wrote. When did you start to write your diary? A: Yes. Well, on the 22nd of June, the war break out.

So she said the best thing what you can do, you cross the River Yemen (ph). There is a boat. You will...you are on a boat and it will take you over there and then you go up to the...to...and this is what I've done, and this is the way I rescued my life. And when I came...came back home and uh it was entirely a different Kovno. The Jews were closed themselves up behind the...behind the curtains and closed doors. They didn't go to the...to the shops and to their businesses because the Lithua nians already started to to attack Jews whenever they could met them in the...in the street.

They used to rape women and it was a terrible situation that that was absolutely...they used to go...the streets of Kovno were full of groups of uh partisans leading groups of Jews in a circle and _____ either to prison and when the prison was full, they _____ them to certain uh centers and their fortress...the fortresses.

He had a stomach uh trouble and there was a ______ going inside this uh his body to digest, you see, so he showed them that he cannot move, so they told him give us names of uh of public community leaders, so he gave them three names.

They don't want to live, to dw ell with you.

How do you want to squeeze in ? So he says alright. Uh you can take another place. Anyhow uh uh so he says we are not authorized to give announcement with regard to to being expelled from the city. We have to think and to explain to to...so he says I give you time until tomorrow at ten o'clock. Bring us...if your reply will be positive, I'll order that this should immediat ely stop, these killings and and robbing of foods and raping of women...it should stop im mediately and in addition, I will order to release three thousand women and children who ar e in in the prisons and in the fort under arrest and this was a very great incentive to the to the to the thoughts of the Jews, and then they met again at the at the rabbi's office. I was there all the time and they decided...uh said that there's no way out other ways. There was no way. Not they will not go.

And then later th ey gave an order that the Jews 14should elect...should nominate an overjuder (ph). It means a a chief Jew. A chief Jew. And all these nominations Altestenrat (ph). Altestenrat means a council of elders, to remind you the elders of Zion. You understand? All these aimed to one, to dehumanize, to to degrade, to hurt the feelings of Jews and ______. And this was the most dramatic and the most historic last meeti ng of the Jewish community in Kovno. Q: Why? A: On the 4th of August, 1941, at a school, th ere set the most prominent leaders of the community were still alive, because many we re already killed. Approximately five thousand Jews were killed on the roads, in the city and so on and then they...it was opened...the assembly was opened by Dr. _______ who one was very veteran leaders of the Jewish community in Kovno... Q: And you were there? A: I couldn't be in the assembly with those ___________. Because I I...you know, I I am telling you I was sitting in the the rabbi's uh apartment and I listened. There was an elder report the first __________. When they came back from... Q: The meeting... 15 A: When they came back from the committee, I will not enlarge what happened to them. They were arrested on the way from the from the Gestapo to their homes by Lithuanians and they were...and among these uh...there...Gol dberg was a mili...a military officer, a high officer in the Lithuanian army. He tr ied to speak to the military commandant of Kovno who he knew. He was in the same military school and this the night _____..._ we have to make it short, so this Goldberg we nt to one of his fellows who was well-known. There was established a big new ministry, as if they would gain their independence, the Lithuanians. They sent cables of gratitude to Hitler signed by the Archbishop _____, by the Bishop ______, thanking him for liberating uh Lithuania from the Soviets, you see, and uh so the Lithuanians were...and they imme diately established a cabinet of ministers of Lithuania as if they would gain independence, but the Germans, they never thought of of giving them their independence so... Q: Right. So Avraham, tell me about the assembly, about the.... A: Yes. So the assembly, the the...can we ____, the chairman, and he and he spoke in very, very cloudy expressions and cloudy...cloudy, false pictures of the situation outside...outside the school where the where th e meeting took place, and he said that the children are being killed, the women are being raped, all men are being taken to slavery, arrested and so on. There was not in the history of Jews a situation like that, but nevertheless there were situations, hard situations, and the Jewish people always...the 16____, the _____ in the past, the ____ end was so that we survived them and he hoped that omens of this type Hitler will also...his e nd will be the _____ in the history of Jewish people, but nevertheless in describing the terrible situation of the Jews, the desperate situation, he collapsed and he couldn't conti nue to talk. Then came the problem the order of the Germans is that the Je ws have to nominate a chief Jew and if the Jews themselves will not nominate a chief Jew, they will nom inate themselves, and we had already the terrible experience of other places where they nominated, you know, a man who has no responsibility, with no background, no way...so there was also among the candidates was Dr. Elkes. The first candidate was, of course, Garfunkle who was a member of the Parliament, the head of the Jewish faction in the Parliament, for instance that Goldberg who had uh was a a a front ____, a fighter for Lithuanian independence. They had ____ but they they absolutely refused to take over the office because they knew this is going to be a servant ___ and into the of the of the Germans or the Nazis, and nobody wanted to be to betray his his his commun ity, the Jewish people. More so that at that time we knew already that the the chief Jew from Vilna (ph), Dr. _______, very famous Jewish leader, community leader, he ______, so nobody wanted to take over and there was a stalemate. In a way...no way out and nobody would take any office, so then stood up Schumuckler, Rabbi Schumuckler, who was a absolutely unknown rabbi from a suburb of _____ and he stood up but yet who was in main kind of way...everybody agreed and everybody wanted that Dr. Elkes. Why Dr. Elkes, Elchanan ELkes. Because he was one of the best physicians in Lithuania. He was the private physician of the German ambassador and of the Soviet ambassador and of all ambassadors, so they thought that he might because of 17his relationship being a private doctor for the German ambassador, he might have have some influence and maybe do some good or avoid some hardships and so on, but of course this had nothing to with that. Q: How did he respond to the nomination? A: He...I will tell you before I an swer. He said no because the...according to the Germans, who have to go to the ghetto, there we will have a municipality for ourselves. We will have our own community, a closed community. No Lithuanians will be will be allowed. No no German will be allowed to go inside. You will be free to ma nage your life as well you can, so each was supposed to be a municipa l...a a chairman of a municipal council, so Dr. Elkes says I have no experience at all in municipality, in municipality...municipal work. I never have done anything but physician. He was the head of the interior department of the Jewish big hospital in Li thuania, Bikkur Holim, and he was...I said I was all my life a doctor and I have no any wh atsoever experience in in municipal work. Q: So what persuaded him? A: So then...so then it was a stalemate. Nobody...and the Germans said if we will not nominate, they will nominate and this was th e worst thing that could happen to us and before long in despair, then stood up the the rabbi, Rabbi Schumuckler and he said, ________. I appeal to Dr. Elkes. Everybody...since you are the most...are the most 18suitable to be a head of whole community in this unusual, unique time of rest...risks and despair. You have the experience as a great doctor. You know the German ambassador and and you...for who you be a chief Jew, a overjuder for us. You will be the respected ______, the head of the community, ________. Those who will fulfill a mission of _____, they can never fail and they can never be harmed and we will be...go with you until the end and we will help you and we will assist you. We will be at your ___ at anytime, and so though _______ or head of th e committee here, and you will with God's help...the rabbi of course ______ don't repeat it so much...with God's help, you will lead us to the end of the war, and you will lead...take us out from the ghetto which is a _____ inside _____, and you will bring us to the fatherland and ___ soil, and there you will be the head of a community and so and so. Everybody was in tears. He was so emotional and he was so persuasive, and Dr. Elkes stood in the corner. He never never stood _____, and he stood up and he said, if you all think that I must...it is me that must lead, the chief juden, the overjuden, I'm here. He sacrificed himself for the community _________, and when he said I am here, he says y ou, so this was in great relief in the in in in in the whole and everybody stood up on his leg...on their feet and they actually ____________ and they shake...shook hands with him. It was a a most...a most emotional scene that can never before _____ until the rest of my life.

I was the speaker. 19 Q: Why did you that? Did you know him? A: Because...because I knew... Q: Why did you have such faith in him? A: I'll tell you. There was not a person in Lithua nia that didn't know the best...the the doctor but in addition I knew Dr. Elkes because the only thing that he was...he was never a mem...member of any Zionist party, was never any committees. He was a doctor one hundred percent, but he was one of the three trustees of the _______ found in Lithuania.

You see, he was a great man and at the same time, he didn't turn his nose up. Q: He was a generous man? 21A: He was a most generous man and known like that. He was a very rich man. He was a very rich man and mind you, I want to jump now. ..in his...in his last will, in the ghetto he wrote in the ghetto in 1943 in Hebrew language, which he gave...handed over to me before I escaped from the ghetto, he he didn' t mention not a single word of his of his richness. It was a very big property in this in this most fashionable part of the city of Kovno. His children he sent, because of bei ng a rich man, he sent his two children, his son and his daughter, to London and this is Professor ____ Elkes who you met in there, he was then in London, and this is the last will that they allowed to him and to his sister, and this is will that to be passed to him (laughter) before I escaped from the ghetto. Nobody knew will I at all succeed in to pass through and so on, so he was a great Zionist, a great Jew, a great devoted Jew with a very deep feeling of Jewish heritage. He had a responsibility and when he took over, he was known only as a physician, only as a great physician and we gave trust in him because of his special relationship with the German ambassador, but then he had shown himself by his day-to-day daily steps, dealing with the Russians. For instance...I'l give you an instance... Q: Alright. Tell me. A: In 1940...the very beginning of the ghett o, came to me a Mr. Bronson (ph) who was a director of a Hebrew school and a lawyer who was not a Zionist, ____, and they came to me as secretary of the of the Jewish co mmittee and they told me, look, there is a possibility to buy a gun. Can you speak to to to the Jewish committee that they should 22give money to pay, to buy the gun? So I we nt to Garfunkle, the Deputy. He says good, a gun. What they talking? It is dangerous. It will be dangerous for all the ghetto. Don't...don't mention it. So I we nt to Dr. Elkes. So Dr. Elkes said go to the treasurer and tell him that I order that you give to Bronson the money to buy the gun. Both very...I...I most Jews devoted but here is a man of the season, of daring _____, most very ______, you see. Then the first days when you came in into the ghetto... Q: Tell me about those. Tell me about the ghetto and the creation of the ghetto. A: So you see, so when it sees the the the Lit huanians attacks on the Jews in the cities, in their dwellings, in in the stores, in in the streets. They attacked terribly. It was impossible to pass the street for a Jew, and they said...uh we were three lawyers. The second lawyer...one of the three was killed two days after he was elected. On the 6th of August, there was...they killed a thousand Jews on the street, and among them prominent leaders like _________, so so we remained two, two of us. Dr. _____ was the elder one so he was the secretary, and I was the deputy secretary. On the 15th of August was the last day to close up the Jews in the ghetto, but because of the riots, day in, day out, in the city Jews left the city already by the end of Ju ly because there in this area they run out, the local Jews steps in. You understand. This was the situation. Jews themselves went and then when it came nearer to the ghetto, th e Lithuanian municipali ty ordered that the Jews themselves should build the barbed wire fence around the ghetto, the Jews themselves, and I have a letter in my co llection from the from the municipality of...you 23are ordered to bring fifty Jews for the building of the of the gate around the...not the gate but the barbed wire around the ghetto, and they should bring material, their own material. The next day you should bring a hundred people, a hundred Jews, and I have a photo where the Jews were building the fence around the ghetto, and this reminds me a very Russian song. I told you I know Russian, so there is a song...brick layer, brick layer...is that one passes by and sees brick layers are laying brick on the buildings that they are building. ____ all the buildings, so it says brick layer, brick layer, for whom do you build these...these buildings. For whom are you laying the bricks? So he said you don't disturb me. _____ we are very busy in build ing...they are building...building a prison for themselves. And this what I had in mind when I saw these men building around the...but these were the Lithuanians, not the Germans. Q: Describe to me what were the living conditions like in the ghetto? A: What...we are not in the ghetto yet. Wait a minute. So you see, the...already from before the ghetto, they were rationed...Jews were not allowed to appear before ten on the markets, open markets, because let the Lithua nians buy whatever it is and whatever the rest, ___ were taken to Jews, but then we were now forbidden at all and this order of the 10th of July, 1941, Jews were forbidden to appear in the open markets to buy from nonJews, to hire vehicles from non-Jews, to use help of non-Jews...absolutely. And they were rationed hundred grams bread a day...hundred grams bread a day. Hundred and twenty-five gram meat a week, fifty grams sa lt a month so it's clear that on this no one 24could could live. Even to starve was nothing left, but what was most important, when the ghetto was closed, there were many Jewish inst itutions in in social, medical, cultural, yeshiva and all kinds, so but they were all kinder...uh house for orphans, so they brought on the on the 15th of August when it was the the last day of entering the ghetto, the Lithuanians brought in a truck, two trucks load of children from orphans, from Jewish children's home that remained there and they pulled them out on the entrance of the ghetto on the on the on the pavement and they left them. Q: Did you see this? A: I was there. First of al l you should know what I was not present and what I did not see and what I did not see, you'll not hear from me, because it was...I went back and forth, back and forth, so and then we were all in ghetto. Q: How did you respond, Avraham, when you saw th at? I mean, what did you think? What were some of your...? A: ...the first thing to do was to allow.... END OF TAPE 1 - SIDE 1 25A: ...we had a fire brigade, and the fire brigade came immediately, you know, and to take these children and bring them in to where...we didn't have an orphan's home in the ghetto. We didn't have a children's home in the ghe tto. Where to bring them? So we brought them in a certain place what was formerly a sc hool just to be able temporarily that they be under a roof. This was how the Lithuanians behaved ______ to to orphans, and this was...I...if there is a God, I don't believe, but if there is a God, they should be punished for this. They should never gain their independence. Never...never...never. And then, three days after we were incarcerated in the ghetto, they finished the the the barbed wire fence around the ghetto and the gate and then three days...and they every day they gave Jewish committee head to mobilize Jewish work ers for the various German places to to clean the barracks, military barracks and the Gestapo uh building, to clean the pavement, to...tailors, uh pressers and all kinds of things. Q: Hold up on...are we out of tape? OK. TECHNICAL CONVERSATION. END OF TAPE 1 - SIDE 2 A: ...and then they commence to know what I've said. 26Q: Oh, that it's wonderful. They're hearing ex actly everything they need to. OK? So what I'd like to start back is on those first days of the ghetto. Tell me about those first days of the ghetto, would you? What was it like? A: Yes. So first of all, the first terrible bl ow that we got to to burst out of the children, orphans, on the _________ the Lithuanians, but on the third day of the ghetto on the 18th of August...15th of August the ghetto was closed...nobody comes in, nobody goes out...and the 18th of Aug...and they used everyday used to send workers to to town, to various places outside of the ghetto. This was hard work, very hard work that Jews were not used to do, for instance in building...brick... laying bricks or in the barracks to to the the the men's rooms and the the other cleaning di rty things, so they said they need five hundred workers of academic (ph) professions for archives work, so people were so enthusiastic about this opportunity. Instead of going and cleaning the lavatories and and and to build the roads and so on, so there appears five hundred thirty-four, and they took them out from the ghetto and they killed them in the very same day. And when Lithuanians who could see from around the fort ...fortress, they there were...the next day came Jewish workers nearby and had to walk to the _______ and they showed them...they ________ the Jews. We didn't belie ve. We couldn't believe how can...how can five hundred thirty-four innocent men, reputable th en...lawyers, engineers, chemistries, uh physicians...why should they be killed without trial, without interrogation. We couldn't believe it because this was on th e third of the ghetto. And then Dr. Elkes 27tried to go from one to the other, from one to the other, the dignitaries and not the dignitaries, and the civil...and the civil uh authority and then in the in the in the police... Q: What was he doing? Was he tryi ng to find out what happened or why? A: Yes. He said I'm the chairman of the Jewish committee and the overjuden. He spoke in their language and I am responsible for these Je ws. I have to give a reply. I I I...please tell me why didn't they come. When will th ey come? Where are they now? What are they doing, you see? He didn't speak in this tone like I'm talking now, but he...he found always the right expression...first of all not to to hurt their Nazi dignity, and second to force them to to to to answer him first of a ll, to answer him, and to answer him in a way like a human being, because a Jew is not a human being. You understand? So they...first of all a Jew doesn't deserve that he he should ge t an answer at all. But Dr. Elkes put it in a way and the...he just told them of his uh relationship with the German ambassador. _________. It worked some...sometimes. Muc h...not much...uh but nevertheless, but he is a very...is a...was a most courageous ma n and he always said nothing can happen to me. My sixty-four...five years are behind me and he always kept in his small pocket a poison and he said if worse comes to worse, he will...he will not fall in their hands alive and uh and he...and he asked which was very dangerous. Nobody, no insurance company in the world would give insurance for the life of Dr. Elkes. Yes. Because every small...not don't speak about the the _______ commisar or the deputy _____ commisar who was responsible for the ghetto was himsel f a murderer, so a murderer...the the first 28ruler of the ghetto from th e civil authority was the deputy ____ commisar of Kovno by the name of Jordan (ph), and why the _________...he write his name Jordan, but he was just a terrible guy. Q: Terrible person? A: Terrible...a mass murderer. He...for instance, he used to come in into the Jewish committee office. He never opened the door. He didn't take the handle of the door and open it. No. Because the handle of the door kept Jews and he cannot make...put his hands on a on a on a handle that the Jews have kept _______. It would be dirty, his hands, you see, so he used to open with his boots, push the door...open the door with a with a crash and the very appearance of him was alrea dy thunder of _____ and and and unrest and of and of God knows what it brings. And he would be so so uh harsh and that even the superiors in Berlin thought he doesn't know how to behave before his superiors be...because ...not because he was too harsh to wards Jews. Towards Jews you cannot be harsh enough because the the final solution is the final solution of every Jew, but he took over certain functions that wasn't in in the in the priority...in the in the authority of his superiors...________, so they sent him to the to the front and he was killed there, you see, and so it turned out that these five hundred and thirty-four, they had to admit to Dr. Elkes finally that they were killed by the thirty-four that sabotaged the Jews too. They were supposed to...in in a in a store of sugar, they poured in gas...gasoline, and so this was why they were killed. Of course, this was the Nazi ______ but this is what they said, so in the 29first three...after the third day of the ghetto, this is what we learned and what is ghetto all about, because we didn't know what it was about . And these, of course, such things didn't let me rest for several days, and I wrote ab out it at night. I wanted to start actually our interview with mentioning the fam ous Jewish historian, ________. He wrote monumental books on history of the Jewish peop le. He lived in _____ at the time of the outbreak of the war with Russia, with Germany and when the Nazis came to take him from his home, uh he...the only word that he could spell out before he was taken by surprise, recorded and this I kept in mind all the years, recorded...the Germans never wanted to that the outer wo rld to know what's going on inside the ghetto. They never wanted to know what activities the mass mu rderers had enforced. It was my inner impulse, a driving...inner driving force to put it in writing because I was myself overwhelmed. I couldn't talk to anybody about this. There was not a possibility to talk because there was so taken the day to day and hour to hour with work in the Jewish community and I I uh I had a secretary and I had to go to the to the German offices uh to in town to ask, for instance, let's say the the l east. We had an office. We needed pencils. We needed a typewriter. We needed uh pape r for typing and so so I I and the secretary used to go to the stock rooms of ______ single authority and ask for this. I have here a form letter order, so we, when you were out of the ghetto with an escort, you know, the first year. The second year was only you had to get a certificate in order to...but we didn't need. You...every every every uh day when I went from the ghetto to the stock commisar, to the government authority, it was approximately for eight kilometers, five miles, six miles. On the way each one could spit you in the face or kill you or or damage 30you or whatever it is...you...in German there is a wonderful saying..._________. You are free as a bird. Everybody can kill the birds. Nobody will arrest you and so on...you understand? And this is what I felt and to go in a a let's sa y not leave alone the Gestapo, I didn't go much to the Gestapo. In very very rare cases, but mostly I went to the stock commissar or to the general commisar. What is the stock commissar? The commissar for Kovno, the city of Kovno. And the _____ commissar is the general for all of all of Lithuanian. If I couldn't get something from from the thing, from the city commissioner, I tried to go in and ask from the from the ge neral commissary and uh and uh there either you meet Lithuanians who look at you like you're...you're run away from a prison, even they spite you or they beat you or they will kick you or whatever it is. Seldom I used to meet a colleague, a former colleague from th e law school, a Lithuanian that used to to throw me ______. Very very seldom. Very seldom. Q: What did you if they spit at you? A: What? Q: What...what could you do or did you do if they spit at you or kicked you or...? A: Not at all.

We didn' t get it for two months and instead they used to send us _______, ______. Terrible.

Certainly not, but they...they could perhaps try to be...not to be as harsh as the others so when uh they they came to the commander, said the people cannot go to work because for two months they have no bread. The pe ople were poor. And it was that from the ghetto each day left the ghetto gates eight thousand to nine thousand people in various places of work. This was the only employme nt source for the German military offices and installations and the only place alone of the building a military airport. They mobilized from the ghetto five thousand worker s, seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day. It was a terrible slave work in the very beginning of the war. Q: Avraham, you told me that when you had to move into the ghetto that there were thousands that had to move into a very small area where only seven thousand before lived. Was it crowded? Wa s it...what did it look like? A: People remained on the on the on the open ai r. There was...I used to have several paintings that would show people...first of all, there was a housing committee, but the housing committee couldn't make more buildings than it was. You understand? So uh we first of all everyone...whatever I say I have documentary. We waited until the 31st of 32December of '42.

It means ...it means approximately uh...how should I say in...a meter and this is what...inches...inches ... approximately six inch es, five inches per capita, so this was not a living space so it was absolutely impossible, but we didn't have just the space and we...and we asked them that they should allow us to use...there was a...let's say a a cinema.

But while so waiting and looking fo r her husband near the prison and then 33the 9th fortress, so she didn't take her time to go to the housing committee of the ghetto and get an order for a dwelling, and when she came it was already the last days of the ghetto and there was no dwelling available at all. You understand? So it was only by by by chance or by incident, by accident...I don't know...whatever you want to call...that she made some very good friends, they gave her a corner in their dwelling for her and for her little daughter, and all our minds were absorbed to look to to rescue her husband. You can understand it. Q: So if you were to walk down a street in that ghetto, it was full of people? A: We..._______...there were two two things.

It was a time of starvation. In order to to to make it more more visible for you, we had in the ghetto vegetable gardens, free, open space so we built the potatoes so that in the harvest, we worked potatoes, but the people were starving so they couldn't wait until the potatoes would be ripe so they we re...they all jumped on the on the vegetable uh gardens and they took all the unripe potatoes and they ate them.

I couldn't keep it at my private home because they would come anyhow to to to look at my private home, and I couldn't give it to anybody else and when I asked Pnina just by chance, I was sure she will say no. Why should she take such a one terrible risk? Find a a entry of diary...this means death. Hundreds percent...no mercy. But she said _______. So I said Pnina, think over again. This is a very dangerous thing. I'll hide it. Alri ght...alright. To cut a long story short, she was hiding it and this messenger that I...we were in the ghetto...he worked with me in the secret ariat of the ghetto, he used to bring this every morning under his shirt, you know, the the entry of that day and bring it to her.

Sometimes I had terr ible experience with the Germans in town and I just couldn't take more and I said toni ght I am...I cannot write the diary. She said you can not. Dictate to me and she took the pe ncil and paper and she wrote with me entry for that day, and that's why you'll find in my...in the original, her handwriting. You understand? So this is...so we did not make l ove so much as one can think, but we made so very much human...human contact, human de votion to each other that that cannot...I 43have no words to express it. I had...I mu st now tell you in my youth...I...it was very dangerous thing for me to meet a girl or go out with out a girl or more than that, but this was not the case with Pnina.

Q: Do you remember some of them? A: I have it in my head. I I have it...I have it in the...I asked...I suggested that they should put in ____ and they didn't put it in, but this wonderful song. For instance, there is a Jewish book of songs, folk songs, ________________.

I cannot translate it, but this is just one of them, and of course... Q: Was there humor, Avraham? A: Huh? Q: Were there jokes? 45 A: Oh and how...and how. This was the great thing. For instance, I'll tell you...where to...this was...you asked me about life...this wa s the daily life in the ghetto, but in in addition, we had for instance Pnina, the same Pnina, but from this Pnina would not...there was not another one. As I told you, she had a very tiny place. Then she got a little bigger place and we had a circle, cultural circle, eight to ten people. There was a poet and there were two...two writers and then there was a Jewish writer, a Polish Jewish writer _____ who wrote a very great novel and there was a...the head of the cultural department of the ghetto, Dr. _______, and uh there were Garfunkle who is a...was a member of the parliament and myself, so we used to meet once in two weeks for two hours. Where? In Pnina's dwelling. Where did we sit there? You cannot imagine. But there we sit two hours, each one...one used to read all of his poems and we had a journalist, Dr. ____, who listened to the...to understand radio and he used to report on what's going on the front. And he...he was called around the the the intel ligence...military intelligence report. And there was one that was reading from what he had written and sometimes I used to read one of my entries. These were two hours of inspiration, that not everything is lost, that not everything is bread, that not everything is tears, that there is life in in __________. In the depths of hopelessness, there is a strife of light and this strife of light in my case it was Pnina, of course, but everyone had a ______. Such two hours intellectual, cultural. This was entirely contra to what the ghetto stands for, entirely ____ to what is surrounding, but we felt a need in this. You understand. Or for instance, I wa,s as I told you, one of the founders and leaders of the Zionist underground, so one day I get a call 46from the from the ghetto, main ghetto gate. There...there is one woman that speaks...she is...she wants to speak to you. She asked for ________ and when we said that _____ cannot be reached, she asked for _______. I didn't know who who was it, so give it to me. So she tells me _____. Yes. I bring regards to you from _____. _______ was a Zionist underground in Vilna that we heard from our correspondence. So I told her, tell him take care and bring her straight to me. Who was it? It was Irena Adamowicz, who is in the book. She was a Polish that was very much close to the _____ movement in Poland and she was going from ghetto to ghett o, bringing reports to each other and it was for the first time after a year that we heard ______ came. She said I want to talk to you, so I said please talk. She says no, I want to talk you in private. So I went in one of the rooms. She says I come now from Vilna. I am...I bring regards from _____ or from this or from this...so of course we cannot talk here. She says alright, so I arranged immediately a meeting of...____ meeting of the committee of the _____ of the underground at my private dwelling and I ...there were two from the underground ____ that said alarm if somebody comes in and all went to to work in my...because they were in my dining room where all the members of the executive of the Zionist underground and in addition Dr. Elkes and Garfunkle, yes, and uh and uh Dr. uh Dr. Shapiro was there. There was a _________ who was also a member of the underground. For a half a day long, she reported to us on what's going on in the ghettos. For the first time that it told what could be...you know, something was going on behind the barbed wires. We never had a slightest idea and here comes a woman. She spoke fluently Yiddish, and that's why the gate...they couldn't...they couldn' t be suspicious because if she would speak 47Polish or something, they wouldn't let her in at all. You understand? And this woman disclosed to us for the first time so open, a little little ______ say in Hebrew, in English, ____, a little window, a small window to the out er world, what goes on in Warsaw, what goes on in Vilna, what goes on in Lodz. And then we reported to her on what's going on in the ghetto and she was amazed, so this en counter with such a Polish Catholic woman who is exceptional. By the way, she came to Palestine the ______ Israel, in '56, and she was _______ . You cannot imagine what...to te ll you...unfortunately none of my sisters uh survived. They all were perished in the war, but even if my sister would come I wouldn't be so happy she was there, and they took her around and everything. I ____ out of my way and I look to please her and so on, but she was a Communist. Of course ____, and this is where we...where we differed. But this very meeting inside the ghetto with an outsider was in itself a breakthrough, not exactly what the Germans intended...their intention to to close us behind barbed wires, that nothing should be known to us what's going on and nothing should be going out what's going on inside and when the 28th of October...this terrible day, the most terribl e day in the ghetto, the selection of 28,000 people, inmates of the ghetto, and they told it...I don't want to repeat because they spoke about it with regard to Dr. Elkes this morning before, so this selection of eight, ten thousand were in one day...all of a sudden we felt that we are...if it can happen in one day that the men ________ their own finger in their, ____... Q: Pointing. 48A: Pointing, since ten thousand toda y, so we would have been _____. Q: How did this...that happen? Did they call people to the square or...? A: I beg you pardon? Firs t of all, the the Gestapo said that in ghetto are people who are working hard and there are people who are working less, and people who don't work at all, so we'll know that the portions of food for those who are working is not enough. We know that hundred grams of bread per day per person who works is not enough, so we want to enlarge this portion for those who are working and to leave the portions that are now only for those who don't work in order to make sure who is...these who are working, so we want that you should...all...all the inmates of the ghetto, th irty thousand, should report on the 28th of October on the big square democratic, families-wise and groups of working-wise, you see, and then when they make they make uh divide separately in one place those who are working hard and those get double rations and those who are don't work will get the same rations as now. So Dr . Elkes said if this should be done, he said, we can do it ourselves. We take...give you the list of the people ____ ourselves out of department of supply, we'll give double rations to those who are working and give less rations, the same rations to those who are not . For that purpose, you don't need all of the 30,000 inmates of the ghetto to report on on on the democratic square. We we we do not believe that this is the true reason for for th at order and Elkes worked very hard and he met twice with Roka (ph). As I told you...and what did they tell Elkes to __________. Mr. Roka, Mr. Commander, may I talk to you as man to man? It is not.... 49 Q: Avraham, let's stop here because we have le ss than a minute of tape. And I want them to switch the tapes... END OF TAPE 2 Q: OK, Avraham, you were telling me about th e massive selection on that day. You were telling me about the selection. A: Yes. So uh Dr. Elkes tried to squeeze out fr om Roka what is the re al reason for ordering thirty thousand people, old and young, sick and healthy, uh babies in in in the arms of their...children...why do they have to go to the court? Will..if it's a matter of food rationing, we'll arrange it. So he says no, th e Jews are too much uh close to each other and they have...and they aren't very...they aren't very...for each other, they they wouldn't...they they cannot trust others will do it. They'll give to one and they'll share with the others and...to cut a long story short, we did not believe that this is the real reason for for ordering all on the square and a certain...certain members of the of the Jewish community...Jewish committee said that we should not uh give the instructions or we should not make public the order. Why s hould the Gestapo itself not make public? It should write in public...why would they want us . They wanted because if it would more information and an announcement of the Jewish committee, there would seem that if the Jewish committee is ordering that, and this under no circumstances wanted to do, so 50finally they decided that we should ask the...to consult the chief rabbi Shapiro (ph) who was a a scholar of world fame. He was at one time a candidate to be the chief rabbi of ____ Israel, and uh we we went to him and he he said that it's a very hard question and he has to check with the...and when we come...he told us to come at eleven...at eleven o'clock night and then he told us to come at five o'clock in the morning and he was not ready, and then to cut a long story short, he came very along and finally he said...he phoned...in in certain conditions that the Je wish community was placed into a a a a situation, that if there is a possibility to rescue part of the community and not the whole community, the Jewish leadership has to do ever ything in order to rescue the this what is possible. I'll tell you later about the the very famous story about the two went in the desert and had also left one cup of water and it was sufficient only for one of them. If one of them will drink the water, the other wi ll die. If both of them will drink, nobody will...and this is...so after having heard this this uh consultation of the chief rabbi, it was the wording of the of the of the forma tion of the ________...the announcement was in a say that the Gestapo ordered the Jewish populat ion of the ghetto to appear, not that the Jewish committee but the Gestapo ordered the Jewish community...so and those who will not appear at the...at six o'clock in the mo rning, and those who will not appear at six o'clock in the morning and they will be found in their house, each one which will be found in his house will be killed on the spot. They shall leave open the houses, the doors, the the shutters, everything, and finally uh there were several...uh and where there is a sick man, they should put in writing, they shoul d put in writing that there is a sick man that is immovable, that cannot be transporte d, and of course all those who were left and 51killed...they killed them and at six o'clock in the morning, there was thirty thousand went with ______ in their hands, to...from various pa rts of the ghetto to this square and I ______ it as the funeral of the victims themselves. The inmate s themselves went to their own funeral, because nobody knew what w ill happen and who will go and who will not go, and at eight o'clock in the morning, Roka stood up on the top of... Q: Was the square just packed? A: Over-crowded...and it was family-wise and work groups-wise. Those...all those who worked at the airport should be all together in one group. Those who worked in cleaning and and in the Gestapo building, they should all in their places of work and the name of the place of work. And the Jewish po lice separate ____ the Jewish uh committee separate with the Jewish and so on, and then Roka started...at eight o'clock, he started...he stood up on the upper hill in order to have a a a overlook all this group and he started ______...____ to march forward and they used to pass by him and then he used to say _____, _____, ____, right. And usually the people see that right is the better...better. Left is not good and at this time exactly the opposite to the right and it happened so that people were very lucky that they were sent to the to the right, but the...to the right they sent the old people, the children, those who are not capable of working, who cannot be the..of real...any assistance to the to the to the effort of war, of the German effort of war, and this took place all the day long. 52Q: Was there panic? A: I beg your pardon? Q: Was there panic? A: Not panic at all, but but but uh let's say uh they waited and nobody know...knew what is going...nobody knew that it's want to be dea d, so maybe it's harder work. We are...anyhow, and uh he stood and in one end he said _______, _____, left, right...and with the other hand he kept a sandwich, and he kept handkerchiefs and they ate very tasteful ____ but they kept also that his finger should not get uh from the fat from the sandwich he had, _______. It was just terrible to see a man without any human feelings at all. He eats with one hand the sandwich and other says left, right, left, right, and Dr. Elkes stood not far away from him and tried to get out somebody from the left to the right side. He said this is a very important carpe nter and this is a brick layer and this is a very...a very machinist, artisan and so on. He tried to help but in the end of the day...and and this took all the day long and people, the old men fell on the spot in on the on the democratic square. Old people or sick people, they fainted. They were left there. They didn't even reach the the selection point. They just left where they were, you see. And uh and the uh it it ended approximately th at six in the evening when it's already sun...sunshine is down, sunset, and then then thousands of people went straight...they went over to the smaller ghetto that was...w hich was vacant before from the 4th of 53October where they put on fire the hospital with the with the patients, with the doctors and the medical personnel on the 4th of October and they liquidated the small part of the ghetto and this and this vacated part that they killed approximately the thousand people on the 4th of October...they left in the ten thousand people were and Elkes tried and when he...Elkes stood all the day long and didn't want to sip...he didn't want to take a sip...water, nothing. He says oh why should I live up to this day and why...what have I done wrong that destiny just goes...and he stood all day and he didn't move. Q: What were some of your thoughts? A: I beg your pardon? Q: What were some of your emotions that you were...? A: I was close to him. Q: And what were you thinking? A: I...I'll tell you why. He was closing a nd when somebody of the police and there was a very veteran Zionist man over the age of se venty. He was the owner of the Hebrew library ____, so he was alone so I told Dr. Elkes, when ____ passes by, try to rescue him, you know, so we...we just told him. We were busy all the day. I at least you see, but, of 54course, he he he rescued that this was a very small part, and in the evening came to Dr. Elkes at his home those who were separated, husband from men and then from children from parents and so on, and they asked him...and then Dr. Elkes uh asked the ______, the commander of the police, of the Jewish police, to ask from Roka th at they should take home from those 10,000, hundred men who were in to to...in his language these were very important artisan (ph)...this is a very important physician, and this is a very important this...and the next morning when th ey were all from the small ghetto on their march to the 9th Fortress to the to the _________, the the Germans called the 9th Fortress Anhilation (ph) Point Number 2, and of course in their secret uh but I got it, you see, and so Dr. Elkes was permitted to go in and take out the hundred but then they fell upon...all of them, Dr. Elkes rescue us. One took him by his sleeves. Another took him by his foot. Another took him by his head and they take him by by his coat, and then there was a great tumult, you see, and they march them to the 9th Fortress _____ all the all the the the ten thousand were mixed up and the Lithuanian partisans entered and they beat up Elkes terribly on his head and he fell and he fainted and then we rushed from the other side of the ghetto uh several people and myself a nd we we took him on our arms and brought him entirely...he was two days in that place. He was terribly wounded and this is what he he could he could always...they told him if we don't go aw ay from you, we take you to the 9th Fortress. This was a terrible...the most terrible day that there was in ghetto, and another day that I think I should mention... Q: We have to uh end the interview. 55 A: End? Q: Yeah. Your wife is in a car waiting fo r you outside and we'll have to pick up maybe tomorrow. A: I am not quarreling with my wife. Q: Not after forty years. I'll walk down with you. A: You...you know where I'm at hotel...at th e at the uh...what do you call it...embassy... END OF TAPE 3 Q: Avraham, what I would like to start with is for you to tell us what were some of the the private ways that people decide the Nazi regulations and the Nazi laws in the ghetto? A: Well, we usually read and hear about the heroic uprising of the Warsaw ghetto, of the Lodz ghetto and so on. Also in Kovno, the uh the escape from the 9th Fortress, the legendary escape from the 9th Fortress that you read later _____, so I uh but the main...I always am trying to stress and this is what I' ve done in my diary I think, to stress the fight of the each individual, of the inmate, the pl ain man or woman in the ghetto, even the the 56boy...child...for survival of one day. Sometimes survival of another hour in the hope that something might happen. Q: And what did they do when you...? A: So first of all, the rations that the Germ ans gave to feed the inmates was a ration for starvation. No one could live on a hundred grams, but also this hundred grams of bread, the uh the inmates didn't...the the the individu al inmate didn't get because we had kept secret two thousand souls in the ghetto. Babies that had been born despite the the strict order to cut off pregnancies. Second there were old men or sick men that if you would put them on the register of the in...inmates of the ghetto, they would have been killed, so this two thousand...approximately two thousand had to be...to get food, so we cut off from the general portion that we got uh so everyone got only approximately eighty grams or eighty-five grams of bread so that the othe rs can get also. So each one in his own way tried to get additional food. You couldn't go in in the supermarket and buy it. You couldn't go in because in the ghetto there was nothing, so people used to go to the...to work outside town and there try to get out for ten or fifteen minutes and buy and buy...not buy because nobody sold. It's war time and it we re sanctions also in the city but the Lithuanians had enough food but they wanted always to trade in. They would give you a loaf of bread or half a loaf of bread for a pair of trousers or stockings or a jacket or whatever. I...for reason I remember it was the 31st of December, 1942. My present wife sold out...already sold out everything she got, but she...there was left a gown, you know, 57for the ball, for very festivity...made big festivities. She was a rich woman, so...but nobody bought a gown in in in time of war, so we had in the opera house in in in Kovno, there were a group of Jewish workers who worked then in the opera house as dressmakers, as uh as to make the haircu ts and uh you know, ____, and they were also working and cleaning the the opera house so I took Pnina and went as workers in that brigade and she took along with her the gown. It was a wonderful gown, you know, and with the...accordingly also a pair of shoes, you know...elegant, and there on the 31st of the...before...the eve of the New Year, the actresses there jumped on this merchandise, you see, and so she she got some bread and and a little bit of uh of uh sugar, you see, for the gown, which costed hundreds and hundreds. Just in one of the examples of one fought for the survival of another day, mo re so when she had a small child and she needed...badly needed milk that you couldn't get in the ghetto, leave alone an egg, you see, so this was an opportunity for her to bring milk and then when she got it all and she got rid of her gown and this, it was a problem how to pass the control at the ghetto gate. When...at the ghetto gate there always sentries of the ghetto commandant, the German ghetto commandant, then all the Lithuanians on one side. From inside there were the uh employees of the Jewish labor exchange who us ed to to arrange the exit of the laborers in the groups from the ghetto out to outside to th eir places of work and they were...had ways and means to bribe certain sent...sentry or the Lithuanian or the German, and so they keep uh close... close an eye and and they pass by, take part of it and give them as bribe you see, but nevertheless something left, and in th is way people tried...tried not to starve, just plainly...very plain words...not to starve. And uh some some others used to to get 58a...make this deal of trade in above or thr ough the ghetto fence. There was a barbed wire fence, two meters high. The Lithuanians knew th at there is a shortage of food inside the ghetto, so they used to come and from a from a distance show a loaf of bread or show a a sugar or show five eggs, you see, and the and the...from inside the ghetto they used to show a pair of trousers or a jacket or something like that , and when they...when they nod of the of the of the head, they came to to an agreement or they trade in, so when the...along...along the barbed wire always twenty-four hours a day, the sentry used to go back and forth, back and forth, so the moment when the sentry used to go, let's say to the left, they used to throw above...above the the uh fence to the Lithuanians and they used to to send...to throw above the the food, and we used to call it _____. A ______. You know what is a ____ in the war, a _____, and this was a _____ merchandise. Q: Avra...Avraham, tell me, you mentioned the ope ra house. Is that where the orchestra in the ghetto played or...? A: No. In Kovno they had a wonderful opera house. It was in the center of the city and they had excellent, excellent Lithuanian...Lithuanian uh singers. Also one Jew was...a Jew...one of the main singers was a Jew, but the orchestra, the musicians mostly were Jews and part of them, those who were not kill ed before entering the ghetto, they were in the ghetto. First-class musicians. For instance, this soloist of the of the musicians, yes...he was in the ghetto. A soloist, violinist. And severa l others. The doorman at the uh Jewish committee offices were a first-class pianist. We didn't send them to work 59because we wanted to to to save their hands , their fingers, you see, but he was a doorman and was very happy to be a doorman. You unders tand? Others were policemen, you see. They were such policemen like you were but they...this was the way to keep to keep uh their fingers, you know, that not be entirely...and in addition they were certainly not used to hard labor, you see, and some use...I can switch over...when I talk about the ______, I want to finish with regard to the to the fight ____ and then small children were in danger of being killed in the first place because they don't...so what did we do? We arranged a so-called vegetable garden guard of young children of the age of eight to twelve. From the age of twelve they could already get a wo rk and be laborers and and a a card, a labor card which was absolutely vital in the ghetto, but what would we do with the children from eight to twelve, so we organized this . They were a group that was called ______, _____________...the the guards of the gardens. We had only vegetable gardens, and the very _______ about about a hundred and yet they had a uniform, you see, and they had an arm band and so in this way we c ould...and these young...youngsters also wanted to eat, so they used to try, you see, first of all uh when they were in the gardens and the gardens were along the ghetto...the ghetto fence, so they also sometimes...being small children, they used to squeeze through the ope...raise a fence. One keeps the fence...two people comes from both sides. He is a sma ll child so he came thr ough, dig a little bit in the earth, you see, and he went out and brings, sneaks in some bread or something and and he makes in the ghetto, you see, so even small children were cautious of the danger of starvation and they have knowingly lent into danger of life in order to get some food. 60Q: How about the kids that were under eight and twelve, the the children...what did they do during the day? You know, the six year olds or five year olds or four year olds? A: Oh yes...well, you see, so uh fortunately... unfortunately from the beginning we were not...we were not conscious of the great danger of these children because we never thought that they can take children and kill th em, but when the the aktion of the 4th of October, 1941, when they put on fire the contagious hospital in the small ghetto with the patients inside, with the uh doctors and with the personnel, medical personnel, all of the them, they were put on fire and they lead...but before they put on fire this building, the adjacent building was a children's home, an or phan's home, and there were approximately five, six hundred children so they took them out from the building in the broad...in the courtyard of the...of the contagious diseases hospital and were just plain put them...I can never forget the picture. There were small ch ildren and babies, just babies, in the in the orphan's homes so the Germans when they put them on the on the on the ground, on the ground, and they just kicked them from one side to the other side with their with their boots, the Gestapo men. People like beasts. They behaved just like beef...beasts. They used to kick them...when the children laid, for instance, with their faces up to to heaven, yes, so they kicked them, then turned down, and then again. This was a just terrible, terrible, terrible sight to see it and then they took them from that courtyard straight to the 9th Fortress and they killed them in the very same day together with another thousand uh inmates of the small ghetto, after they put on fire the the the hosp ital. They did not let...our firemen were very...wer e the fire brigade in the ghetto...excellent fire...firemen 61were trained years and they were ready to to to...but they didn't let them come near to the place, you see. There were Lithuanian fire br igades who came close to the close to the uh ghetto fence, but they came just to safeguard th at the fire shouldn't come over to the other side of the of the fence. You understand? And this is...so you see they were just not to to to fight the fire but to see that the fire shoul dn't grow to the other side and uh this was one of the most tragic days and what...it is wort hwhile mentioning, in that very contagious diseases hospital, you see, we were...we didn't have so much space and so many hospitals, so part of this contagious diseases hospital served as a maternity where children...women gave birth to to childr en. This, of course, was absolutely against...contrary to the to the restrictions of of pregnancy and so on, so when they took out the uh the uh the uh the uh...they took out from their beds many sick people and they brought them in one place where they couldn't ___ for sure. They shouldn't remain sometimes in ____. There was left some part of the building, left after the ___, so in one...they they left...they didn't...they just pass by one room where two women were laying after giving birth to the child, to the babies, and the two babies were on, you know, on the window there is a...big window there is such a...you know, like let's say this is the window and here is such a small...a small wooden...wooden...

Shall we leave these two babies? You see...and in silent they went out and they left the two women with the two children. I...I am telli ng this to stress that even among the murderers were single, very rare, very rare...but there were sometimes people with human feelings and they behaved sd hum an beings and not like beasts like all their their comrades. Being with the swastika a nd over the Nazi, you know, the grey...the grey uniform with the with the swastika with all this...to look at them was...one got frightened, you see, but these men, that they came back a nd they looked at the faces of the baby, he couldn't withheld from being...they they commit...and these two women and these two babies were the only one that left from from from that hospi tal, you see, and this is...this is...we always remember it. Q: Avraham, you brought Esther, the artist... A: I beg your pardon? Q: You brought Esther, the artist, to draw scenes from that hospital? A: Well...so so at that time.. .at that time, when they liqui dated the ghetto, the small ghetto, they took thousand men from the ghetto and they liquidated to the 9th Fortress, so I didn't 63have any _____ more in '42...it was...in '41 in the beginning I have to say prior to the aktions on on human beings, on life, they took...confiscated all the belongings and they were...when the ghetto inmates were ordered under threat of death to give all their gold, their belongings, their silver, furs, _____, post stamps, collections...whatever valuables, and there were two stations in the in the ...near the Jewish committee where the Jews had to bring bring all their belongings and wherever they...while making the searches inside the houses, each other, and sometimes on the sp ot killing them and and this brought about the people to run and get rid of their gold, to get rid of their silver, to get rid of their of their of their furs, you see, so we didn't have any cameras anymore. If...in...on the ____...it was in August. The the big...the big confiscation, the to tal confiscation of whatever people had had with them. Others di gged it in the earth or somewhere and they didn't...like Mack (ph)...I'll think about them later, but the the overwhelming majority, they were left without a penny and without any valuable, clothing or or furs or whatever it was, so I didn't have a camera anym ore, and I thought it is absolutely possible...impossible that this event, that this side should not be somehow eternalized for posterity, but this already...the ghetto, small ghetto was out of bounds. It was cut off from from the ghetto. I'm sorry I didn't take along with me my documents. I would have shown you. So I went to to Esther _____, and I told her, Esther, you must draw what remained from the burned hospital, so she said how can we come in. It is it is out of bounds, so I I went to the commandant of the ghetto and I told him that since it was it was October...in in Lithuania in October it is already cold and very cold and we had no firewood in the ghetto and what they used to give us, just like the hundred grams of 64bread, this was the same story with the with the firewood, so I told them in the small ghetto, some families left some firewood. Would he allow us to take out from this from these dwellings inside the small ghetto, to take out the firewood? So he he...and I don't remember that I mentioned it yesterday that the commandant of the ghetto, mostly they were elderly men and they were not so, you know, fanatic like this, so they had understanding...he had understanding for this and he tells me alright, I give you two hours, two hours to go in into the into the...so I said I need a uh a wagon, you know, but I didn't need a wagon. I wanted that Esther, so he he gave a wagon and I took Esther and I went in inside there and we stood and we looked where would be the best position geographically for Esther _____, to the painter, to stand and to paint it, but to paint from outside would be would be very dangerous because they could have killed us on the spot because all the time the sentries go around the ga te...the the fence, so I decided that we should go inside a building and the adjacent bui lding from the left side of the burned hospital was a two-story house so we went into this story...two-story and we arrived on the second floor and Esther from the the window from which she could have a good look on the remain...what remained from the hospital and she painted and she drawed and she draw and this is what she have made it, but all of a sudden when...as she paints she...and I am on the outlook...all of a sudden I hear somebody went in in the first floor so I got frightened to death because if they would found us, Esther... probably it would have been the finish for her, and I was responsible. I'm the bad guy that brought her about her about it, you see, and I felt terrible, frightened to death, so I went closer to the staircase in order to see who is there, so that when they hear d the...my footsteps so they run out. What 65happened? These were Lithua nians who had...who came in just to to to to steal and to take away what the Jews have left, so you see this was also...and this ______ but to to learn the moment of danger to death was always there and uh she has done it and, of course, I took her some firewood from the house, from another house and be...behind the firewood I put the the drawings of Esther ______ and we safe came back to the to the ghetto. There was another place where I took Esther _____. I don't know. I think I mentioned to you that the...wer e the ____ of the Lithuanians in the...in Slobodka.

They just went from street to street and one of the houses...I I...then I I'm always after to see wh at it looks like, but they closed up the area and nobody could go in and and the and the houses after they have been looted, they closed up with uh wooden blocks and uh and uh and plywood so you couldn't go in inside the the the houses because it was locked fr om ____. Anyhow, I I went in with Esther _____ and one house that I knew was a a Zionist leader. He was the director of the _______ in in Lithuania. _____ was his name, a famous veteran Zionist. His wife was a dentist, and I wanted to know what happened to him, so I took Esther ____ again and, you know, I am a sportsman so for me to to, you know, to to ____, that was not such a big problem, but for Esther _____, it was not easy.

They said, the Gestapo said that they need the ar ea and these dwellings to settle the Jews who are to come at this very day from Germany and from Austria, five thousand Jews. That area lived only three thousand, but they squeezed...so when we heard, we took it for granted that first of all five thousand Jews are coming to the ghetto and Dr. Elkes, the head of the Jewish Council, said we have to meet them as brothers, give them the feeling they are coming to brothers, so he ordered that the women should prepare hot coffee for them because the terrible cold...in January was the thirty...thirty centigrades below...below uh below uh below...thirty below...the most hard winter in the ghetto was 68in 1942. Dr. Elkes himself stood all the day from the beginning whenever we we got word of that five thousand are to come in the ghetto, he stood at the main gate with several people, and with women who were rea dy to give them...offer them coffee. He felt very much...and he he says I can understand the feeling that these people were taken out from the houses, from the from the countries, and they don't know where they're being brought. At least give them a greeting for...when they will have to cross the gate behind barbed wires, they should...barbed wires they should know that they're coming with brothers. So we...those inmates from this area to be vacated in four hours didn't have any transportation.

They uh...some uh some uh home uh utensils like uh like uh for children to bath, you know, the...it was used to drag it and on the snow. You understand? I I saw the the the the picture of all the people frightened to death to be in time not to remain there after the...it was just...I said this scene I must put on a drawing, and then I didn't find Esther _____, so I run to...there was one young...the youngest painter in the ghetto.

And when he didn't...he he he was not conscious of the of the urgency. Every minute counts...I would say not minute...but every hour counts, and he slow ly...I said _____, quick. Have no time...I didn't...nothing. So he he took another coat, of course, as it was very cold, and took some 69paper and and and some pen. In addition to the pen and pencil, he took color paints. I said what for does he need these color paints, but he didn't listen to me at all and he took everything, put under his under his overcoat and bring just running. It was far away from his...it was on the other side of the ghetto. Running we came to the s ite and there I had to find a place where he could stand and make hi s paintings that should not be seen by the Germans, not even before Jews. You understa nd?

It is in my book, with colors, oil painting, so this was _______ and this was the the the liquidation of that quarter. The Jews came from Germany, but they were sent straight to the 9th Fortress and were killed the very same day and the part, the area was cut off from the ghetto. Q: And the three... A: I beg your pardon. 70Q: ...and the three thousand that were moved...where did they go? A: No. They didn't...they cut off from the ghetto.

Q: How did you learn that the five thousand were taken to the fort and just killed? A: We have seen them. You see, Dr. Elkes at the gate was waiting for their coming, and all day Dr. Elkes didn't drink even not cold water. He was in such shape, tense, waiting, expecting, and they didn't come and they didn't come. In the afternoon, they were brought and you know, the way to the 9th Fortress comes along...it's a half a kilometer, half a mile, from the ghetto fence, up on the hill it goes, and you can see. Everybody in the ghetto could see and we saw them. They came...these five thousand men, and then how did I...we know? As I told you, in the Gestapo building worked a group of Jewish inmates from the ghetto in cleaning, in in _____, in in in in the cleaning the the the lavatories, in in uh ________ and all kinds of...so they, when they came back, they came the next morning to work, they could see many many suitcases and bundles with names of from Berlin, from Frankfurt, the name of the Jew...you know, the the Gestapo took...they looted their their belongings and they brought...you see, and they threw away the uh the suitcases and the bundles and you could see the names and addresses of the 71people who were brought in, so we were...there was no lot of doubt that this were the five thousand who were killed in the very same day on the 9th Fortress. Q: So what the Gestapo did is they took their things? They took things that they wanted? A: Always they take. First of all, they take off the rings, the gold and then they take they count the valuables, and they put them in their hip pockets. They don't bring it to the Gestapo. You understand? From the board wh ere the suitcases, on the trucks...so we had always several size that are workers in that building uh used to work and uh this was also one day in the ghetto unexpected. You neve r knew what the next day will bring you. There is a very nice poetry, Russian language...what does you today or tomorrow bring upon us. ______________. What expect us...what brings to us the next day? Will it be day of sorrow, of pain, or will it bring to us a new hope, a new joy? It is a very, very nice poet from a very famous uh Russian poet. We don't like the Soviet s, but we like very much the poetry and their language and their literature. I am telling you I I I was uh I was...I lived...Lithuania was under under these Russian czars and I studied law, the Russian law, not the Bolshevik law. Come back to the ghetto. Q: So with that, I mean you never knew what the next day would bring. How did people keep their spirits to go on? 72A: So so...you know, there were...there were...the re were...there were various kinds of reactions. There were people in the ghetto that didn't...they they thought maybe this is the last day so why not eat?

Tomorrow we will not...we will not...even on the eve of the of the 28th of October, people were...most of the people were in tension and and didn't know what is going to happen tomorrow. Others thought this is the last day, so they used to concentrate in their thoughts, in their minds. Others took out everything that they had and said they w ill eat up everything, not to leave for the Germans the next day anything. You see? It...l ook...it's thirty thousand people. It is not a a...you don't think by order. You don't act as somebody would expect you to act. Everyone in his own way. You understand? A nd so there was a very very thin...a very thin group of people who ate in meat, in butter, in eggs, a very thin few...those were the smugglers, but they, of course, uh uh rescued th eir...risked their life. Some of them were killed. You know, you can uh make a _____ once, twice, but the third time you...a bullet comes and finish...finishes you. You understa nd? For instance, Dr. Elkes and all those...he was close to starvation. Although he was very...again and again offered by the smugglers, we'll bring you butter. We'll bring you this. He never ac cepted not a piece of bread. He used to share with me my my pi ece of bread, you see, or offer me his piece of bread, but he would never never have any connections with smugglers which we thought 73it's...the underground...it's the...what we are trying to fight, just to keep the standard of of human of human behavior, of Jewish heritage , to keep alive even under these terrible circumstances of the ghetto, and this is only th anks to Dr. Elkes and to those leaders who were known as community leaders before the war and they were elected by...elected, and this was the difference, the big difference between the ghetto of Kovno leadership and the leadership in other...in other ghettos.

We'll pick up from where you are. 78END OF TAPE 4, SIDE 2 Q: OK, Avraham, we're going to start with the underground and the Zionist movement, the Zionist resistance movement. Tell me how that was established, what some of your activities were, and who some of the leaders were. A: Yes. Now uh the the situation prior to our being incarcerated in the ghetto behind barbed wires, the uh terrible attacks and killings of uh Jews in the streets of Kovno, right after the outbreak of the war until the the incarceration in the ghetto, called for immediate resistance because we had a...also even under the Soviet occupation, 1940, June 1940 to June 1941, we had also a clandestine Zionist...Zionist uh movement or leadership let's say it was, but this is entirely different character. While under the Bolsheviks it was our main aim to assist the families economically. Of the leaders we were being arrested right on the first days of occupation, they were arrested. They were taken to Siberia. Second, to try and ourselves try and avoid our own exile to Siberia. It was very clear that uh the...under the Soviet occupation, not only were we were able to to to maintain our Hebrew schools, Hebrew education. They closed up immediately. They closed up...liquidated all the Jewish institutions leave alone the Zionist parties and movement and so on, but what we had is a really in the very sense of the wor...of the word, to try and to keep away from arrest and to keep out hiding. We were hiding. I, for instance, were were hiding from the moment when I was told my brother-in-law was not a Zionist. My sister, means my sister, she was religi ous and Zionist-minded woman and she was the 79oldest sister, ______ ______. She didn't allow me to live in a pri...in a in a...somewhere else but with her, to stay with her all the years that I studied at the University of Kovno law. Yes. She was very much devoted.

Q: Bundists... A: Bundists. And he was a Bundist. He...there was a Jewish Bundist paper in Lithuania, the the _______. _____ was the name of the Jewish paper which were the organ of the Bundists in in Lithuania. Q: So how was the Zionist resistance differe nt than that ____? You said they...they supported people economically. Then how...? A: I I'll come immediately. And then we we re assisting one another. He told me...my brother know this what I've told you but re member, it was...he told me, look Avraham, you're on the list to be exiled to Siberia, so just try to to to...from the surface...disappear. So I told him wait a minute. I will sleep wi th you. He says what? You'll sleep with me...if they want to find you, you will...they will come to me. They know that I am your brother-in-law and they know that...your sister. So I finally tried hiding in various places 80in the outskirts. I run away to Vilna (ph), to Vilna. Yes...which was then the capital of Lithuania, and in Vilna I found out who...with whom could I make contact, also Zionist leaders, but they themselves were hiding, so we are hiding together in a park, in a in a lane, you know, uh somewhere out...in the outskirts of the city, and it was an absolutely impossible situation. You understand? A nd to the end, you know, I couldn't...couldn't see any other way out but to come back to Kovno, and when I came back to Kovno, two days later... Q: The invasion... A: The invasion...German...German war break out and so as I said yesterday, I went from the from the pot to the to the fire. The the resistance in the ghetto or even before we were incarcerated in the ghetto, was entirely of different character and entirely of different dimensions and entirely different aims so uh when the historic and dramatic meeting or assembly of the Jewish...of the Jews...Jewis h leadership of Kovno to elect a over-Juder (ph), a chief Jew, and this...and the committee, in the very same place, in the very same school, former school, two hours later we we held a meeting in another room of this very same school for leaders of the various Zionist groups. Uh there was the...a member of the left-wing ____ movement, pioneer m ovement, who I recall ________, _______ and then there was the labor movement. You had th e labor movement, and then was the ______ and then were the general Zionists. 81 Q: Do you remember their names? A: Oh of course.

The...from the _______ were the head, the chairman of the _______ movement in Lithuania, ________ or as I call him, ______, who passed away in Israel two years ago, and uh myself representing the Zionists, general Zionist moveme nt. Three or four. Right after joined us a fifth one, very active. This was _______, Issac _______. He was most uh instrumental because he was a pharmacy and the...was the head of the oldest pharmacy in the ghetto, and since we considered that the pharmacy is the most place that nobody will think of that there is any hidings or some contra...contrary Nazi activ ities, so we below the...below the the pharmacy where there was a cellar a nd in this cellar we arranged uh to have one...to listen to a radio from abroad. Th e...it was the only..._______. This is what you have from the...to to liste n, you see. _______ we used to go down the the the pharmacy in the cellar and listen to radio. Mostly himself would listen but because each one was busy in certain tasks and then we used to come frequently...once a week, even sometimes more...but this was really top secret. Also for all various groups. I never told my ______ from general Zionists that we have a leader ship of the uh of the for...of the underground 82in the ghetto resistance. What I told them is that we have first of all, to be organized ourselves, keep together, be ready to oppose the Nazis. For instance, after the 28th of October, we had a decision of the underground, of the all the the the underground, the Zionist underground was called ________ Kovno. _____ the the letters, the initials as _______. ____ as you know, the Hebrew...in English to translate it is, in in in distress, in in in uh...not sulk. You are in a very hard position. You cannot move. You are surrounded and you are in in in in in a uh in a very bad situation, let's say...and uh the _____, we called _____ always to be on the alert, to tell us, to signal us whatever they know in their dwellings or in their working pl aces, what they have heard and what they know, to bring us the news, so we used to concentrate after the day of work when they used to come back from the works from the pl aces, they used to to report to us on what they have heard that day. Q: Where would you meet, Avraham? W ould you meet...be hidden someplace...? How many of you would be...? A: We...we...first of all, there was only small, very small _____, four, five. Not more. Six was the maximum, so we used to...we meet either in a a in a in one's dwelling or somewhere on the vegetable gardens as if we are working those vegetables. Sometimes we meet in the center of the village because...or or in the or in the cellar of the of the uh pharmacy. Because for us was...we were cut o ff of the outer world. This was exactly the very meaning of the Germans by setting up the ghettos. First of all to keep us behind 83barbed wire. We cannot go out. We cannot have any contact. We didn't have telephones, and later when we had telephones, it was also for the...only for the inner...inner communication between the pol...Jewish police and the and the and the German commando of the ghetto for even...for his convenience, not for the convenience of the Jews. Or there was a a telephone in the Jewish committee, in the labor department, and so on, for the convenience of the Germans, not for us. But we knew to exploit also these. For instance, the telephone...there was at the gate, there was a service police station at the at the ghetto gate, Jewish police station. For the other side, outer side, there was a German's and the Lithuanian's police. Inside there was the Jewish police, so whatever...if...whenever some top official of the Gestapo or of the Wermacht or the stock commissar, entered the ghetto immediately th ey signal by phone to us. In the Jewish committee it was myself. In the labor, we had another man. In the police, we had another man and this used to come _ _________. Immediately...if there...for instance, when Roka came into the ghetto, we were...t he the streets were cleaned up. Everybody run away and then so we used first of a ll together use or information on what is transpiring in the various places of work in the ghetto and what they have heard and there were rumors more than than facts, you s ee, but even the rumors for us...we...not having any kind of communication with another city. There were three ghe ttos in Lithuania. The Kovno ghetto, the Vilna ghetto and the ____ ghetto, but there was no communication so the first work what the Zionist underground have done, to establish a communication between the Kovno ghetto underground and the Vilna ghetto underground. 84Q: How did you do that? What did you do? A: Oh, this is a good question. You are a very intelligent interviewer, I will tell you. So you see, there was a Jewish...Jewish worker group...worker...who worked at the railway station in Kovno, and we the the head of this group, usually a group of workers...in in the terminology of the ghetto it was a brigade...a brigade, and the head of the brigade was _____ Silverman (ph), who was a member of the underground, so we called him and told him to listen. You are working at the railwa y station. There are going trains day in, day out from Kovno to Vilna. Try to bribe one of the workers of the of the railway...of the...of the...who are working on the train, yes, so as to get that you could send some letters from Kovno ghetto to the leaders of the underground in the in the Vilna ghetto, whom we knew. And this Silverman succeeded in bribing the man who drive...the driver of the train...how do you call it...the driver of the train...the loco... Q: Conductor... A: What? Q: Conductor of the locomotive. You see? And first I remember he came, right, give me...so we gave him ten letters. Each one of us knew one or two from the Zionist, previous Zionist leaders in the in the in Vilna. For instance, I knew _____ ___ was from the youth Zionist general youth movement, so I se nt to him a letter. The others sent to 85their...to their respective ___ in Vilna and we and the same Silverman gave these ten letters. Of course, it's not easy to take out ten letters from the ghetto because if they would find...if they would check him on the date when he goes out as head of the brigade and finds the letters, it was the end of him and of all th e brigade, so you you you had to be very, very careful. But he succeeded and he and he he bribed this conductor of the locomotive, of the train, and uh he was supposed to give these to one of the underground in the _____ or ______. ______ was from the, you know, the name. He was one of the leaders of the Vilna ghetto and the Glaserman (ph) was the leader of the ______, so each one sent to his man in Vilna, and luckily the next day, he brought letters from them. This was something that opened our eyes and our minds and you couldn't know but of course this was...the the letters were restricted to several lines only because... Q: What did they say? A: Yes. So first of all, we are telling them in a in a in a very...in our own language to make them understand that we are trying with them...saying that we are organized, that we are trying to keep ____ together, and from time to time we meet, and we are trying...we are trying to keep the the mood of ______ and give them the feeling they are...they are not alone. They...its give them to renew the sens e of belonging so that gives them also more security, more defense, that in case someth ing happens, they know they have to...they...as ever a man to whom they can go and open their arms and their pains and and their problems and so on, and there were, believe me, everyone had a full heart and pains 86himself or his family or his parents, or his friends, and that we want to get a ______. We didn't say it like that. We want to ge t from you a _______. You understand? And we didn't have to put the more words in the in the few lines that we wrote because we were...had to be ready that it will be detained and then go and explain. And so it was that we got first...the first contact with the with the Zionist underground in the ghetto of Vilna, and we developed later on also to send letters from families from the ghetto of Kovno to families in the ghetto of Vilna. Q: Avraham, tell me what those first letters from Vilna that came to you...you told us what your letters were to them. What were those first letters to you...? A: First of all, he tells me, for instance, this is what he said. First of all I am very pleased to hear that you survived, that you live, that you are among the living. Second, I am the same...I am pleased to tell you that I and my wife and my brother-in-law and my sisterin-law and ____ and this, this and this is already...this is in Siberia and this is there and this was killed. The names of the leaders, the former leaders, you see...this is what ____, and even ____ of who is and who is not, and believe me, this was most important. You see? And then uh in the next letters...already we started always your problem...food or is the problem of labor, what are the the possibilities of uh of uh fight...____...we didn't say fight...____...you see. We knew...we want to know...again I must say a...quote a Russian saying. They say a man...a a a bird that is in distress knows exactly how to keep a most either shout or cry very aloud the form out express ourselves and tell what...what...what 87is...what is their interfering or what is their desire, you see, so the situat ion brought about to bring our news that we wanted to to tr ansfer to the...to the _____ in Vilna, was in a very, very masked vocabulary, and we used to say the next time, ____ or ____, whatever it is, you see, and we used then the slang or just uh new words that wouldn't mean to anything...to any...nothing to anybody but for us it was understood _____ Gestapo we didn't mention the name Gestapo would be in another form ____ of this. Q: Did you share information about the depor tations or the liquidation of the ghettos? A: Of course. Of course. This was the firs t thing which we have done, and we wanted for them to ___. Then we wanted to know...certain family when they started to write, they wanted to know about their members...there we re certain families that part of them were in the Vilna ghetto and part of them were in the Kovno ghetto. For instance, my wife, her brother, two brothers were in Vilna, and this was the first time that she learned that that he is alive while the other brot her was killed, and this was the first time, and the very first uh communications. So when more more letter s were sent and we had to distribute the letters to to the to the inmate s of the ghetto, we used the...we had an office of statistics in the ghetto, administration. We didn't speak about it but uh statistics. We...they wrote every birth and every passing away from the ghetto, every marriage. We had marriage in the ghetto. Life went on. Of course, a good...there was a bar mitzvah in the ghetto and uh and and I want to tell you...I must tell it. On ce I was sitting in my office in the Jewish committee and all of a sudden I got a call from the workshop, big workshops in the 88ghetto. We had big workshops that worked eighteen hundred, mostly women who could not go out of work from outside the ghetto, a nd there were a carpentr y and tailorship and and plumbers and uh and uh and uh washing, cleaning...all for the German army, but we...and so so uh the German supervisor of the ghetto used to come to the Jewish committee or he used to come straight to th e workshop. There for...he liked very much to go to the workshop because he could order a suit for himself, a pair of boots, from his wife he ordered dresses. It didn't cost him money, you know, sent, so all of a sudden I get...I get a call from the workshop, big work shops uh that I should immediately come. Miller is there. Miller was the deputy ____ commissar who were at the supervision of the ghetto and when Miller says I should come immediately, I have to come immediately. So on my way from the Jewish Committee to the ghetto workshops, I passed by a small lane, a street... it's not a street...it is a a... Q: An alley? A: Huh? Q: An alley? A: An alley. Very tiny alley and one takes me by the by the sleeve and he says, ___ come in and and doesn't wait I should come in. He directs me in inside in a ______ and the and the...so I told him, _____...he was _____. He was a Haisidic (ph). In Lithuania, we are 89not Haisidic. In Lithuania, mostly...ninety-n ine percent were not Haisidic...opposing, but this were several Haisidic. One of them wa s in the ghetto and he directs me, and I said _____, Miller is waiting for me out in the in th e workshop. He doesn't want to listen. First of all he says sit down. We have ____ today, and he __________, you know. It's unbelievable...it was something that incredible. Sit down. You have to make the ____, _____________. Be blest to God for sitting in the _____, you see. This is first of all, and second, and I..._______, let me go. The Miller is waiting for me . Wait a minute. Wait, you wait and uh you are...you know you have to to make _____. What is ______. My son is bar mitzvah today, so you have a mitzvah to to drink ______ for his wealth, and I say he'll kill me. ______, you...what can I...what will I say to ____. He said __________. May those who go on a mission of good, the God keeps him and preserves him and will will not give him any harm. This is...and until I said the _________, until I said the _______, and (laughter) so he let me go and he ___________. Q: (Pause) Do you want some water, Avraha m? Here. (Pause) What's upsetting you? A: I beg your pardon? Q: What's upsetting you? A: So finally he left me off and I came to the uh to the uh to the... 90Q: The workshop? A: To the workshop and I'm (laughter) getti ng hell. He says, you dirty Jew, do as ___ German uh uh ______. As I ______ from the party. He was a party man. I have to wait for you Jew _____. Where where have you been? I said Miller, I just fell because on the way I run and while running I fell and I got hurt in my in my le g, so I had...I had to to to to...that's why I was late. You see, I find so mething out but you see, in the most hard times of the ghetto, the spirit, the devotion, the heritage, it is _______ today and you have to the say the blessing ____ so you can say that you fulfilled the mitzvah (ph) of sitting in a ____ and make the blessing, and this...my son is bar mitzvah, so I have to drink...it was...most certainly it was not vodka, but it was something of...there was...I certainly didn't care very much but I was overwhelmed of the spirit. This is, my friend, part of the resistance. It's nothing but revolt against the German order, strict order to press us, to dehumanize us. We shouldn't think of bar m itzvah and we shouldn't think of holy days, and we should think only only slavery, work, on the very hard work that we should think only how to get another piece of bread and not think of _____ and not think of holy days and not think of bar mitzvah and so forth and so on. This is the day in, day out resistance of the common man, the inmates inside the ghe tto, and this is what kept them alive, because _____ is a great meaning. _____ is when the...the Jews were in the desert and they had no place to live and they built tents a nd they were lived forty years but they live in tents where they lived. So we certainly can have ____ hope that one day to finish and 91this was what meant this _______ with the ______. And uh it it keep s...it moves me so innerly to the bottom of my h eart when I think of it. Q: We can stop now. Do you want some more water? (Pause) A: But of course we had much more serious things to do. We...the four of us or more precisely the five of us, the leaders of the underground, before they found us, __________________ leadership, we made a final deci sion...after the 28th of October, no more respond to orders of concentrating on one place of all the...of the all the ghetto or not even part of it. No more. And to resist, to oppose and really it happened so that I think a month or six weeks afterwards, ther e was the order to report on the very same square. They need five hundred workers to be sent to Riga (ph), from the Kovno ghetto to the Riga ghetto. We believed no more what they say because they said the five hundred, they were to to the archive and they were killed. They said they need to to to make order to divide between those who get more bread and those who get less bread, and they killed ten thousand so this ___ that we had no confidence whatsoever and we made up our minds no more response to...and then they tried...they started to grab people from the street, and they could grab three hundred because most of the people from the ghetto were at work outside the ghetto and when they didn't succeed in getting the people, so they took these three hundred and brought them to the place, to the democratic square. I went there and saw the sight. At that time there was _____ and the supervisor of the ghetto in ______. He was a mass murderer , and he...all of a sudden I hear that he 92says maybe those will want to volunteer to wa lk to walk to Riga should make five steps ahead, and I was sure nobody will will go, but there were five who stepped ahead, and finally I disclosed that these five were insane or very...not insane but crazy people. For instance, I...one of them was a former high o fficer of the Lithuanian army and I thought what what..._______ was his name...so I said _____, why did you volunteer? Do you know...are you sure that you want to to work in Riga? Don't you know what happened with the five hundred. He says he's ____. Kovno alone must know that I am a crazy man. _____. Let also Riga know that I am _____ and this only showed you who you are talking with, and also this type of people were in the ghetto. Now this was one thing. Fir...second, for...when Elkes was going in town to meet the chief of the Gestapo, I always tried to escort him...from a distance, of course, just in case something happens. Now we...we...our clandestine uh uh _____ that lasted for five months and then they were caught and the man, ______ was put in the Gesta po. He was always almost killed. They arrested the the the main clerks in the Jewish Committee...first of all the secretary of the Jewish Committee, Berenstein (ph). He had not the slightest idea because I have done nothing. They arrested the chief of the statistic bureau although he had no idea but his assistant deputy. They arrested the main uh the main uh clerk _____ of the of the office of the altestenrat. They had not the slightest idea but Elkes turned heaven to earth and earth to heaven until he got them free. You see, and this was...but he was not allowed to be any more the secretary of the of the Jewi sh committee and so I became the secretary in May '42. Then when we had in course of our correspondence we were told that they have partisan groups in the forests around Vilna and this was far behind...from Kovno more 93than a hundred kilometers, and that they will be ready to assist if we send a group to those forests so they should come to Viln a and from Vilna they...so we had a contact and then we started very seriously in training our movement, our Zionist underground movement, in in uh weapons and we had among our _____ two officers who were officers in the Lithuanian army and were very well-trained in in in ammunition, and they were the instructors that instructed these small groups, of course, in two, in three...not in always in the same place. Always in some other place. You understand? And they...I think I told you yesterday that the first gun that we bought was in 1941 in the beginning when when the ______, the teacher...master of the Hebrew school and _____, a lawyer from Charlotte (ph), that I knew them ve ry well before...they came to me and said we'll...we have a possibility to buy a gun. Could you provide the money for it? And I went to Garfunkle, the Deputy and he said what are you talking about. It will be a terrible risk for all the ghetto. So I didn't gi ve in. I went to Dr. Elkes. Dr. Elkes didn't say another word. He says go...go to the treasurer and tell him that I ordered to give the money uh to to to _____ yes, and _____ and this was the first gun we had in the ghetto, but this really was the first but not the last one. And then, little by little, we used to try and how can we bring in weapons to the ghetto. So first of all, ______ worked in many places, workshops where they had...especially those who...to repair German weapons in the in German units, to repair weapons, so he is planning to steal and and how did they steal? For instance, they were about thirty or forty people working in that place where they...you know, where the ammunition stores and the Germans, for them it was a uh a 94just a lost uh let the Jews try to repair it, so each one of them used to take a part of a gun in the pocket, and when they used to come to the ghetto, they... Q: Put it together. A: But to pass with a part of it is also...i t was not so...believe me, it was not so easy. Unfortunately, one of our best men was caught with a weapon. He...he dared to take a weapon himself home, and they thrash (ph) hi m and they killed him on the spot. So we paid very high price, very, very high price, but uh when the...yes...and now I want...when the first group of the Zionist underground was ready to go to the woods, and we knew that there will be the...yes...and we knew that there was a ____ from the Soviet Union in the woods, a top uh officer of the Red Army who trained them and who supervised them, so we knew that they are going in a place wh ere there will be a communist surrounding and there will be also many non-Jews. It was very important for me that they in their leisure time could have talks about Zionism , about ____ Israel, about the events in Jewish history, sing Palestine songs, so I came to some let's say understanding...we didn't sign any contract... with the the communist lead er in the ghetto who later as I said they had also their own underground. I said look Heim (ph)...he was a very...he he was an idealist. He was a communist, but he was also one of the circle, of the cultural circle that we met once in two weeks, you see. He was also a writer, so I tell him, Heim, I am sending...we are sending the Zionists, first Zionist group to the partisan woods. I want you to to see to it that in their leisure time they could sit t ogether and hold conversations. 95When there is a real Jewish holiday, they c ould just mark it. They would sing Hebrew songs and they could tell each another, so he says Avraham, of course, of course. We are want to convert them to communism. This is what he said. He was a very honest man and I believed every word that he told me because he was a very, very honest man. But fortunately they came to the to the Vilna ghe tto. From there they brought them to the forest, but then a month later I got word that they...not they were to mention Hebrew and not a song of ____ Israel, and not mention _____ Israel, leave alone prayers and so on. You understand? And I was very much uh disa ppointed. Yes. We ...when the...when in 1943 when the the communists raised also and a nd organized their their resistance in the ghetto, aided by Heim _____, so we made an agr eement among us to join forces. For the Germans a Jew is a Jew, whether he is a comm unist or whether it is religious or whether it is combat or whether...whatever it is, so uh we had a uh joint command. Two from the Zionist underground and two from the communi st underground. I together with three ______ represented the Zionist underground in the joint command, but after this incident, I said I'm...I know it's not you but we'll...I know you cannot do anything about it but I joined a communist...a command joint with communists. I I I resign. I cannot...it's against my my concept of life. I am a Zionist from early year s, and then came in...instead of me came in ______ from the the pharmacist. See. There were problems. There were problems. They ___ their own problems. Th ere were the problem of _____ to to...when they when they went a group of thirty, forty, yet to a woods, they had to have clothes. They had to have overcoats. They had to have everything. And how did we do it? We had the Jewish workshops in the ghetto, the big workshops in the ghetto, so we used to 96send them to work there. Those who were the first to go to the woods, they should go and work in the place where they repair the Ge rman uniforms, see, and then they used to adjust to ____. Also, we needed German uniforms just to...you know, as a mask so there they used to take, to measure (laughter) a nd not plainly fabricated but to measure. Everyone was equipped with everything. We just stole from the German stores and from the German repair and it worked very good. The...unfortunately, the the main man who led the groups from the Kovno ghetto to the Vi lna ghetto to the forest was the leader of the communist ________ and uh he used to to dress himself as a as a Wermacht officer, you see, with the all equipment and he came to take a group out of the ghetto, all the partisans, and we hired...was a truck and the and the driver was also dressed in German uniform, so that they came into the ghett o. There was at the ghetto gate there was _______. Q: How did you get a truck? A: What? Q: How did you get a truck? A: Oh, for money you get everything. You see? So we we had the money. I want to tell you...in the ghetto ______ I perhaps the only Jewish committee that worked together with the underground. They helped them. They didn't work togeth er but they helped them. 97And they...for reasons once so he he was...I want to finish with him. So he used to take the lead and bring them to the forest and come back. It took him, of course, a week, two weeks, so he used to were a German officer. The driver is a German and here were the Jews, workers, so they take...went through clearly through the gate, mounted the uh the truck and went to to the for...to the woods. Some...one day in a such movements, I was going to the city with a permit because as the secretary of the Jewish committee, but Heim _____, the head of the all the communists, he used to go in clandestine. He had with him a gun always in in the pocket and one day he was caught by the Germans, and he run away from them.

He never said that he was from the ghetto even. Y ou understand? Caught. And nothing came out of all _____. He was kille d and this is...he he died as a hero, fighting with his gun against the Germans, in town. So this is...gives you...I can...I can speak about the underground as much as you wa nt but one...one thing I want to say about the part of the Jewish committee in the underground. One...we didn't have the money to to to rent a truck. We didn't find the...the guy...so we came to the ____ to send a group to the woods, so I came to to the...Dr. Elkes and I told him, look we need to send out a group of twenty-five and would you permit us to use the wagons...there were wagons in the ghetto...to bring firewood, to bring uh all kinds of supplies from outside to the ghetto. They will go in the morning and they'll come in the evening, the wagons, so we took five wagons...three wagons...excuse me. Three wa...five ...five, of course, and they went out and they didn't come back in the evening and they didn't come back the next morning and 98they didn't come the next evening. It wa s a terrible...because where are the wagons? Why don't they fulfill...why don't they come to to town to take the bread, the flour, the firewood. It was a mess, so Elkes said th at they uh the something happened after apparently the the wagons after the horses are not well, all kinds of ____, and then only at the...well, well, look...if it would be disclosed th ey all, the altestenrat would be killed but now no excuse whatsoever, no pardon and we didn't sleep the nights. ______ from the ____, from the leadership of the partisans and my self especially because we were in close contact with the with the Jewish committee and because of the relationship between me and Dr. Elkes and he agreed to do it, so I had sleepless nights. Don't...don't envy me. In what a position I was these three days. Terrible. And we were on the outlook...they were on the outlook and far away we sent outside the ghetto at the bridge that contact...connects with the Kovno and the and the Slobodka uh and the Slobodka suburb just to see may...if they they are there or something happened to them. We didn't know what happened. Maybe they were caught. And only after we felt...they...after midnight they came back worn out, torn out terribly because they...it was not a journey to go...you have to...you have to stop certain places when you see a German uh...let's say on the road a German squad is going or a Lithuanian par tisan or whatever, so that's why it took them very much...because they were succeeded in hiding on on crucial moments on the on the road, and that's why it took three days that took us out the the all all inside...what went inside went outside and you know, there were two rabbis in the in the...I mentioned Rabbi Schumuckler and Rabbi ______. They really went and prayed in the synagogue especially for __________. You see? So this was a very...nothing ____ at all. Not ____. 99And I I must in two words also to mention, we had the confiscation of books which was a terrible...it was aktion not of men but of books, but books. We are the _____. Q: When did that happen? A: It happened in Februa ry 1942. There came a special envoy from Rosenberg _________. Rosenberg was the minister for the occupied territories and he was the man that ordered that all books, all printed materi al that are in the ghetto should be confiscated and taken out and sent to Germany, so uh when th ey came uh to from the Rosenberg _____, Dr. Behnker (ph)...it was in '42. I remember it until today. I'll remember it to the rest of my life. This Dr. Behnker who came to the ghetto and he came to the Jewish committee and said all books should be...and we should write announcement all over th e ghetto that they should bring in certain places, concentrate...conc entration places to bring the books to be delivered to the to the Germans, and all the wagons of the ghetto were mobilized to bring the books from the various parts of the ghetto to the to be handed over to the Germans, so in the underground, ______, we decided the very...mo st valuable books we want to to to rescue, so we mobilized the teachers whic h will accompany the wagons and take out from the wagons valuable books that they consid er of historic value _____ and put it in a separate wagon which was accompanied and th ey would...little children...the..you know, the _____, the messengers, so they were not... and you see, and they...and this the wagon where they stood, took these wagons and they used to send it to...bring it to some hiding place for us.

END OF TAPE 5 A: ...so he says brother, what are you talking about? All the books of the yeshiva are very important, the most important.

We cannot ask the thirty thousand, but we can rescue perhaps five hundred or six hundred. _________. So he says...he says _____ we will hide ourselves. We know how to hide. If you hide them, they will get our books. I didn't succeed to persuade him...his stubbor nness, you know, and the religious Jews, the more they are religious, the more they ar e stubborn, and you cannot fight in the common language.

So he told them that from the fortress is a hundred and fifty years nobody escaped, but he was a specialist of fortifications and he just knew how...to cut a long story short, very short...he blocked out a plan and he led all the sixty-four, all the sixty-four on the night of Christmas, on the 25th of December, 1943.

A: Right before that...before I must tell you a bout the about the the Mack story. Mack was one...a regular boy in the ghetto. He was a jeweler. When all people in the ghetto leave him all their gold and silver and money and va luables, he digged a...below the earth and he remained with two kilos of gold and coins an d silver and whatever it is, and he tried to escape from the ghetto. He was in a contact w ith a Lithuanian group that promised him to take him through the Baltic Sea to Sweden, a nd paid a lot of money, but they had to go through the ghetto, so he tried...he and another...another friend of him, to go through the barbed wire. They cut down the barbed wire, he...Mack...but what...he was a very short...uh you couldn't see from afar, you see...how do you call it... Q: You couldn't see from...short-sighted? A: Short-sided, yes. So he ca ught...cut the barbed wire and they went out. He just jumped on the commander of the ghetto, Fleishman. And he...even that and this is not enough...he took out a gun from his...from his pocket and says, commandant, get away from here. Otherwise I will...I will shoot. He didn't finish the word and the and the and the commander had already his hand on his gun and everything and it was a mess in all the ghetto. Immediately all the ghetto was surrounded by machine, you know, from the Gestapo and military and police and whatever you say. The Germans brought him to the to the commander of the ghetto and they wanted him to disclose...the other one who was 111with him, he retreated inside the ghetto, di sappeared. And they wanted from Mack...the name of the man was Mack...and they wanted from Mack that he should disclose who was the second man that uh that retreated, that disappeared. They beat him up. It was just terrible. When when we came...so what di d they do? They didn't succeed in in in in getting the name so they so they called th e...as hostages took the the Jewish committee, this Garfunkle and Goldberg and Dr. Elkes was sick in bed for...he had a very hard rheumatism, so so the secretary should come, so they took me, so the three of us came, were brought and came here, were brought to the to the to the uh commander of the ghetto and the first thing that they wanted us that we should influence, impose upon Mack that he should disclose who the second was. We had an iron rule in the ghetto...not one Jew be handed over to the Germans by us. So we keep quiet. When I saw Mack in the...in the commander's... co mmandant's office, you couldn't recognize a person because all his head was a piece of of flesh. You hardly could see his eyes, so was he beaten, and mind you, Mack was not a member of the underg round, not of the Zionist and not of the Communists. He was just a plain man, but he did not disclose...more they beaten and beaten and beaten and he didn't ope n his mouth, so then they said... Q: Avraham, we have to stop here. I'm sorry. We'll have to pick up... A: We have to pick up? Q: We have to pick up later. I'm told that we have to stop at this... 112 END OF TAPE 6 TECHNICAL CONVERSATION Q: Avraham, tell me, if you would, about your escape from Kovno, yours and Pnina's, and the last testament of of Elkes, of Dr. Elkes. A: That's right. Well, I'm talking...we are talk ing about the escape from the ghetto and not from Kovno. It is two different things. Well, as I already mentioned before, I was one of the four founders of the Zionist underground movement which was a resistance, and we we...there prepared in the very end when the when the ghetto is...before liquidating the ghetto, the leaders will escape to the woods, to the partisan groups, and this was the planning. It was a matter of timing when s hould we escape from the ghetto and this was a very important question...which one of the f our leaders of the Zionist uh resistance movement were all the positions in the ghetto life, so it wasn't just a matter of once a decision. It had to be a decision with the consent of the chairman of the Jewish committee and so on. But it happened so as I also told you that I was very much engaged in this looking and finding a place of hiding for ____ which was then seven years. When I found such a place and the legendary escap e of ______ from the ghetto, she fell very ill and when she came into the farm of hiding, it was absolutely necessary that Pnina should go there at least for a week because we couldn't bring a doctor. Q: OK. Let me...let me back up and if you c ould tell us on tape that ________ was Pnina's daughter, just so we have it and and how she got to the farm. 2A: Yes, yes. Well...well, ______...Pnina's fi rst husband was killed, was murdered by the Lithuanians...they already in the first days of the outbreak of the war and Pnina went ___ to the ghetto with a small child of five y ears, her name ______...____ less than five years, and she could bring nothing with her from home because her apartment in...a Jewish apartment, a most elegant apartment in K ovno, was taken over by German generals and they didn't let her in when she was taken to prison. All...the all the family was taken to prison. There they were separated. Her husband separated... Q: We have all that. We have all th at from...we have all that from Pnina. Q: Anyhow, so she remained in the ghetto alone with ____ and uh we uh she's...Pnina was uh hiding my uh my entries in the diary and my collection of documents. I felt I must help uh ____, Pnina in hiding...finding a address for ____, to cut a long story short. Uh it was very difficult but in ____ I I I succeeded in finding a contact with a priest who found a place for her hiding and when I took her out from the ghetto, three times I tried and I didn't succeed. It was...it failed. There al ways were a a Gestapo officer or somebody else that we we...our plans failed. On the third time I succeeded in taking her out of the ghetto, but in the two first times of trying, it wa s winter. It was cold so she got a cold. She got a cold and when she finally reached the farm, forty-four kilometers away from Kovno...it's about eighty miles...excuse me, about forty miles...she was entirely sick, ______. And only by accident I...it's not here in the places...by accident got to know that she is ill in the farm, and I immediately went to the priest and I told him we must uh...we must give medical help _________. No doctor can be...can be brought to ____ to cure 3her. At least Pnina would go, take along with her medicine. We had excellent doctors in the ghetto and she took along and the priest was very opposing it because it was the danger. Anyhow, I said it would have meant nothing if she would die, ____, from from illness. It's the same we didn't do nothing, so she was there but instead of being there a week, Pnina stayed there four montheses. A nd she worked there in the farm in all works as was she was considered as a as a relative, far relative from town that she run away from Kovno from bombardments and from the war, but she was for all things and purposes worked with the with the family and she got very well acquainted with them and uh it was a woman, a widow whose husband, th e boss of the farm, fell from a from a thunder...from a thunderstorm and he was buried in in in this farm, and the widow was a very good-hearted, that was very religious, and that's why the pr iest could talk her in that she should take the child for hiding and uh and uh then she was really happy that Pnina came because she didn't know what to...______ was crying all the time...Momma, Momma...and uh I...as I said she lived there instead of a week, she stood there for about four, five months and then she was acquainted there...one...one...the the woman, the widow had three daughters and one son. The son was about eighteen years, but because his father was dead so he was the head of the family and around the farm and he couldn't attend school. He was illiterate and he very much wanted to learn to write and to ready, so Pnina told him, look..._____ was his name ...______, I have a man. He is a lawyer and he is a educated man and he will edu...educate you in writing Lithuanian and uh... Q: Did this man...did this young man...you helped him. We...we do have to cut it a bit. Did you help him? Did he help you escape? 4 A: And then he was the one who who agreed that to to...that I should be brought and he himself prepared a special hiding place fo r me inside the the farm, faraway from everyone, and so I came to the farm. So one day I was surprised by from the priest for me that a wagon will be waiting for for me on the 23rd of February, 1944, for the farm. I was, as I said, prepared to go for the woods but not for the farm, but since I got such a a word from Pnina so it was nothing doing, so I had to escape from the ghetto. The night before...so I told...of course, I told Dr. Elkes about my plans, that I have to escape from the ghetto, and the the last night I spent in the house, in the tiny dwelling of Dr. Elkes, the head of the community, and his deputy Garfunkle and Mrs. Elkes which was a lady in the very full sense of the word. Just a lady, and the two people, I disclosed to them and I told them that my...the hiding place of the five crates of my diary and collection and they should know where it is but Garfunkle, the deputy, said ____, you cannot do it. It is already no ghetto. It's already a concen tration camp. And you are going to commit suicide. Who can escape now from the ghe tto? And how will you make the fifty-four kilometers? I beg of you, don't do it. It is te rrible. It's dangerous. Don't you know the case of Mack. Mack was the one who was caught...they caught at the at the...when he tried to to escape through the barbed wire. He was hanged publicly. Don't you know it? You were there at night, the whole night in the Gestapo together with him in the cell. But Dr. Elkes said go. If you would be my son, I would tell you go because you are the only one who know best what expired in the ghetto. You kept a diary and you have a collection and documentation and it is ...you have a mission to go and bring the knowledge to the world, to the outer world that it shall remain to the future 5generations...the Germans digged out the corpses of the sixty thousand that were killed in the 9th Fortress, so that there remain no sign of it. That's why...that's why I think...I'm sure you have courage. You have knowledge. You have the persistence and you will succeed I'm sure about it, so uh in order to encourage me more, he took out from his drawer his last will. His two children...a son, Prof...now Professor Elkes, and a daughter Sarah, were studying in London and he says here is my last will. Give it to my children. I rely upon you. You...your...your wisdom and your courage and I...what you have done in the ghetto for the three years, you have shown that you have enough power will and you'll...you'll make it, and this is what gave me the courage really to escape and it was very, very exciting for us and we embraced and we kissed each other and then I left his home, two...after midnight, two-thirty after midnight. Two hours late r I was already at the main ghetto gate and there were my two fr iends, the...one of the mo st activists of the underground, Zionist resistance movement. ________ was an officer in the Lithuanian army. He trained in in in the underg round and he and the second one was _______ _______. He's now in New York. He...we called him the savior at the gate. He knew how to bribe the sentries at the gate and when one gate...one sentry will be and what sentry is good, so he fixed it all. At five o'clock in the morning when only one sentry is at the gate...they start only at six o'clock th ey start move from the ghetto, so you come at five o'clock in the morning and he bribed the the the sentry. He...he _____ they were on the on the...we had...at the ghetto gate there was a station of the ghetto Jewish police and of the legal department, so they were offici ally the ghetto, so they let me through the the gate and and then and this way I escaped from the from the from the ghetto with the wagon of another four people, allegedly to bring from the wagon uh bread for the ghetto. 6They returned, of course, without me, but th is is how I succeeded...succeeded to pass through the gate and then the very dangerous time when Geck was the liquidator of the ghetto, he would not spare a minute just to put a bullet himself in the _______, but when I escaped, I got known later that the Gestapo and the ghetto commander uh announced that they'll...five thousand marks they give the one who disclose where...the whereabouts Avraham ____ or his dead body. Dead or alive we need him. You see? And this will show you how important it was, the great he lp of my very close friend. ______, the policeman was was questioned at the 9th Fort ress. He was the one who knew, who saw me last. Where did I go and how did I go? A nd they beat him to death, but he didn't say a word. Even they took one of his eyes out and then they killed him, but he didn't disclose a word. I want to tell you and when I came...when I escaped from the ghetto, I came to the priest and the priest told me the the the widow, the the the...from the farm, she is here with a wagon and two horses and I should take the wagon and the horses and I should cross the bridge that between Kovno and the and the other and the other suburb, _______, which leads to the farm where the wh ere the...they had the farm with the widow, but the the the priest said he wouldn't wa nt to rescue the life of the of the widow, the very good Christian woman in case they ar e be caught at the at the at the bridge, because on both sides of the bridge were stationed military gendarmes, and they checked each and every one, the documents and everything, so it was not very easy. I had no other choice, so and he said that we will m eet two miles after the bridge, after the second part of the bridge, and when we...I came to the horses you know, and they had a very big coat as a a ____ and they came to the br idge. There was a Jew of _____ and because they checked and double-checked, each one will take..so I had false documents as a as a 7_______, _____, you see. Anyhow, so all of a sudden I see that one ____ Jew with his wagon and he passes by the the the sentry, the ge ndarme and he says heil Hitler, and he passes by and they let him go. So I say, well, wait a minute. I can also say heil Hitler. You see? So...but it was a a...t o to decide in a second...this is your life or you live or you possibly don't, but I had nothing to to loose, only to win, so I take out my horse...with the horse my wagon aside and I pass by and I say heil Hitler and with the with the...what weapon I had in my sack then, I showed them below that the wagon is entirely empty. There is nothing, only straw, you see, so ____, and I said heil Hitler, and without ___, I showed them there is an empty wagon. The wagon is ______, in German, and I passed by (laughter) with the greatest of my surprise, you see, and then on the...it's a long bridge and when you come to the second part of th e bridge, again the same...the same story. Another sentry and he is checking again, you know, checking again and again I say heil Hitler. The wagon is _____, the wagon is ____, and they let me go, and this way I couldn't believe what had happened. If one w ould be a religious man, he would say it is heaven. It is...it is a miracle, but I don't believe in miracles . I believe in persistence, in hard work, in making up your mind and know what you do and know where you go, and don't give in and don't take no as an answer . And they...nothing like that not permitted. What was permitted for us? The German was r eally...in the ghetto he came in and they saw in in in a dwelling and they saw a woman lying in her bed, so he said why don't you work.
