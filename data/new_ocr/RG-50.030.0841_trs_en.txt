I did, and he asked me if I want to work wi Œ or get a Œ work with him, get a job, it™s called kapo . You heard of kapos ? Q: Tell me who they were. A: Yes. So I liked the idea, and I didn™t like the idea because I felt I was so young, and I should tell other people who are much older than I am, to go and do this, and do that, and Œ and [indecipherable] Œ I thought it was not my place to do. But I did it. So that™s that. And then we come to Neuengamme . I can™t remember which, to be honest with you, it was one of the ca Œ one of the camps™ barracks. There was some gay people again. They said the Nazis are going to come any moment. They™re going to Œ they™re going to go through the barracks. And they put us in the attic, Edga r and me, they put us in the attic, and I was there for several hours. So, if they would have come, they probably would have picked us and kill us.

And they put us on a Œ on a ship, on a freighter Œ freighter type ship. Not Œ we didn™t know what they had in mind. They actually had in mind to sink the ship. And I have a book, a German book where another man was on the ship, and he knows the name of the ship Œ I don™t know the name of the ship Œ but they didn™t have time to do that because the American came already, so they were fleeing the Nazis. And we saw in the distance, we saw tiny, little boats coming from Sweden . The Red Cross came and took us down. Q: Out of the boat, out of the ship. A: Out of the boat, and saved us.

I Œ I couldn™t dare Œ I wouldn™t dare to say I was Jewish. My friend didn™t look Jewish either. He also said, I™m Polish. Well, they know we didn™t have any papers, so they had to believe us. Q: Mm-hm. And Œ A: [indecipherable] what I™m telling you. Q: Yes. A: I mean that™s Œ there™s much more to it than this, but Œ Q: Would you like to tell me a little bit more? A: I just Œ I just really don™t know. I don™t want to make mistake. We were put in quarantine in Sweden Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ for several months. And then, during the day, we could go in the courtyard. There were hundreds of people every day, from the streets, people asking questions. Refugees who left Germany or other parts of Europe . Have you seen my Œ you were in Minsk , have you seen my brother, have you seen my sister, and so on, you know. So one Œ some woman said to me, have you seen my brother? I said, yes, I™ve seen him. I hate to tell you, but he was Œ he was killed. His name was Interview with Gary H . Philipp October 8 , 2015 43 Horowitz (ph), Hugo Horowitz (ph). So she said, would you visit me after you come out of this quarantine? I said yeah, I will do that. But in the meantime, they called them lottas(ph), those Swedish Œ they work for the Red Cross, I guess, the type Œ that type. She insisted that I go to Œ go to her house. She had five sons.

Q: So this was in Sweden ? A: In Sweden , in Helsingborg . This took place in Helsingborg . In the meantime, I visit this Jewish lady for Œ from Hamburg . I visit her, and we became friends, and I went to America , we kept in touch. We became v ery, very close. They wanted adopt Œ they wanted to adopt me, but I didn™t want to change my name. Their name were Liebentowski (ph). Liebentowski (ph) had a relative. You probably can find that in the Jewish museum. [indecipherable] music. You will find that in some books, Jewish books, his name, Liebentowski (ph). Q: Liebentowski (ph). A: That was his cousin, I guess. Q: And they were from Hamburg , and they had wanted to kind of take you in and adopt you. Were they also going to the United States ? Interview with Gary H .

[break] Gary , you mentioned Œ you mentioned some of the episodes that you went through, and I want to ask you now about some much more personal things, and I Œ I apologize in advance for the prying that this involves. But I think Œ the reason why I am doing so, is so that people in the future would have a much clearer sense of exactly what kind of danger, what kind of suffering people went through when they had no power, when they were completely helpless. So, if we could start with this incident when you were in Sachsenhausen , and someone pulled you aside. What did that entail? This man pulled you aside, he was a kapo , is that correct? A: Yes. Q: And Œ A: Well, it Œ when he looked at me, and I looked at him, I knew exactly Œ I was Œ my instinct told me, I knew exactly what it meant, right then and there, I knew that. Q: And what did it mean? What did it mean? Interview with Gary H . Philipp October 8 , 2015 46 A: Well, it meant that he wanted to, if I like it or not, I have to sleep with him.

Was some big building, I don™t know, was Œ was to work some Œ something there, and I Œ I walked aw ay a little bit from Œ from the building, I was all by myself, standing by a tree. And out of the blue skies came a soldier, German soldier. And he looked me deep in the eyes, and he said Œ he said to me, you want to get away from all this? You want to go ma Œ go with me? And I hesitated of course, I said yes, no, yes, no. Maybe it™s a good thing I didn™t do that, because I probably would be Œ we probably both would be caught, and would be shot. So that was another experience and that Œ gay experience. Q: Did you know yourself, inside, did you know what your Œ what your proclivity was? Did you know you were gay at that age? A: I was just young. Q: That™s why Œ A: I just didn™t Œ I just didn™t know. I didn™t know. I thought I™ll grow Œ I thought I would outgrow it, you know? I didn™t know. I didn™t know.
