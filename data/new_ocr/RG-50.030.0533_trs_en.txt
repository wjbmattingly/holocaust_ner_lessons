So we used to give them marbles sometime and they used to give us a sandwich, be cause they were not hungry, the kids from the farms. So I used to have a kid who used to give me his sandwich. And I used to give him marbles, different things, bells. And then finally one day he came to school, he wouldn™t give us his sandwich. Cause the sandwich, I used to split it with my other buddies from the Œ from the Œ from the Villa Marianna(ph). So Œ so he [indecipherable] I say, why didn Œ why didn™t you give us sandwich? He said, my Interview with Andre Zalc July 23, 2009 22mother says I shouldn™t give to m Œ th e sandwich to strange kids, because you people are not French, she say, you know, like he was a little racist. So Œ so, when he threw away the sandwich, I got him, and it was like a big barrel in the yard, and I Œ I pushed his head in the barrel, you know, in order to get the sandwich. So he told his mother that I roughed him up, because we took the sandwich from him. So the mother came to school. In those days ther e was no gasoline, they had horses, and the mother had a nice carriage with a horse like a racing horse, and she had a whip, an umbrella, and she had her Œ her father on the carriage too. But the father was senile, he was very old. He was on the horse too. And she went to the principal, and sh-she argued with the principal that we beat him up, the kids from the Villa Marianna(ph) beat him up. So I had to go to see the principal. So the Œ the principal said to me, what™s the matter? How come you hit hi m beca Œ and took his sandwich? So I said no, he gave us his sand wich, then he didn™t want to give us his sandwich no more. So we Œ we were hungry, so we took the san Œ so the principal explained to the mother that the kids in Œ in the Œ in the home, they don™t have too much food, so they dependen t on that sandwich. And he Œ he gave a Œ he gave them the sandwich and then he stopped giving us the sandwich. So the principal made before that, all that stuff happened, he made conversation with me, and he was in the second World War in Belgium as a soldier, a French soldier. And he was very Interview with Andre Zalc July 23, 2009 23friendly with me because h-he knew Belgium. So he explained to the mother that she gotta speak to the son, it™s not Œ they™re not malicious kids, they™re like hungry, you know? So the mother changed Œ change d, and she told the kid to give us a sandwich. So, since that time, we used to get a sandwich from the kid. It was a big, big country bread. Th-The French used to make bread, round bread like that, like the Italian country bread, y™know? And the m Œ he used to give us a sandwich, and ri Œ in the beginning we didn™t want to ta ke a sandwich, we didn™t want no trouble with him. He said, no, no, no, the pr incipal knows about it, you can take the sandwich and have your sand wich. My mother said I should give you the sandwich. So there was a Œ a success there with the sandwich, you know, in that school. And then a Œ and then a Œ at Œ I stayed there maybe another month, and then I went back to Tresse, to my Œ to my father and my mother. And Œ and I used to Œ I used to go see my father in the mounta ins, you know, where he us ed to cut the woods? And that became like the Œ the resistance. It b ecame like a stronghold of the resistance. And then one day Œ my mother used to gi ve me food to bring to my father, you know, like food that she made that he liked. And I w Œ I was on the way to leave town to go to the mountains, a German patrol were in town, German troops. And the patrol, they went with me for awhile, you know, and they ask me where I™m going. I said to, you know, my grandmother, I™m going to see my grandmother. So, Interview with Andre Zalc July 23, 2009 24th-they walked a little bit with me. Maybe somebody squealed that I™m going to see my father. So Œ so the Œ the German patrol, the German officer heard like noise in the bushes, because there was a lot of lizards there and even snakes. So he says in German, I understood what he said, he says [speaks German here]. Let™s Œ let™s go back. Let™s not go with them, because it™s dangerous areas, like a jungle, he said. [speaks German] It means it™s like a jungle. So he Œ th-the German patrol stayed in town, they ac Œ they walked a little bit with me, maybe 200 meters, and then they went back. So I went by myself up to the mountain. It was a big climb, was like maybe four or five hours until I got up there. And at that time, they derailed a German train. And when they derailed the German train, there were sardines, they captured a lot of sardines and weapons. There was trains going to Italy that they derailed. And there were Œ there were Œ the train had sardines and sweet milk, because the German women who used to go to Italy to meet their husbands, who were in the German army, used to have sweet milk for their babies. And when they derailed the train, the French resistance captured a lot of sardines and the sweet milk. So up there I used to eat bread with sweet milk and sardines. And then my father gave me some sardines in a jar, in a jar, sardines, because he didn™t want me to bring the cans in town, then th Œ th Œ if they find the cans, they will know that they derailed the train. So he says, and when you™re finished eating the sardines, Interview with Andre Zalc July 23, 2009 25you bury the jar. So I did that, I buried the jar. But I didn™t bury the jar deep enough, so the next week, German troops came and they surrounded the town, and they made Œ they took us all on the Place de la Gare in the town, and they used to search the houses for the Œ search the houses for weapons, becaus e they know in the town there™s resistance who derailed the train. So th Œ so I buried that Œ the jar on the Œ on my landlady™s yard, next to us wh ere we lived. And he used Œ he went with the dog on the yard, and the dog smelled the sardines, so the dog was barking. So he didn™t want to dig up the yard, you know, th e sardine there, so he says to the dog, du verrückt hund. It means, you crazy dog, why are you smelling here? [indecipherable] and he kicked the dog. And Œ and the dog cried a little bit, and he l Œ he left with the dog. But if he would every undug that place, he would have find the jar from the sardine, and that could have been dangerous. So the Germans, all day they kept the people prisoner, and they searched the houses, but they didn™t find nothing, so they left, they left. And then Œ and then we st Œ in the town we ast Œ we Œ we stayed under the German occupation. And they came Œ they didn™t come all the time, the German, they came once in awhile, and they Œ but a lot of Germans went through town to go to Italy, the German convoys. They went to Italy to fight the war, they were fighting the Americans and the British in there. And then they landed in Normandy . They landed in Normandy and then Œ the south of France Interview with Andre Zalc July 23, 2009 26was still occupied until August Œ until July the 15th, they landed in San Tropez , and they Œ and they came up towards Œ towards Tresse, but they stayed on the national road. Tresse was liberated by the resistance. And then the [indecipherable] papers [indecipherable] you called, that the people should go to the mountains, should go to the mountains because the town is gonna have Œ can be fighting in the town. So the entire population went to the mountains , the civilian population. But the people went to the mountain, they had food with them. And then we went too, my mother, my two sisters, my father was in the mountain, he didn™t go with us. So we went to the mountains. So we stayed there about two days, and we had no more food, so my mother says, take the wheel carriage from your sister, you know, the carriage, and go to town an-and get us Œ bring some food . In the Œ in the closet, I got some chichi beans, you know, some th e beans, and Œ and some mel ons. And take it, take it o Œ so we have enough food until Œ until the liberation, you know. So I got to town, and as I got to town with a friend of mine, a kid, he came with me, the town was all empty. It was like a no man Œ like a Œ like you see from the Œ in the town of the cowboys where everybody™s gone. So we got to town, and we got to the house and we loaded the wagon with the food, the melons and the Œ and the beans, and as we want to go get out of the house, two German armored cars come in, and they Œ and they go Œ they o Œ they Œ a ll the bars were locked, yeah, so they go to one the bars, Interview with Andre Zalc July 23, 2009 27restaurant, and they ripped the doors open. They ripped the doors open and they take out the drink and they put the table outside and they start drinking, the Germans, you know? And they were the Germ ans who were supposed to protect the town, maybe about 30 Germans with Œ had Œ with the machine guns, the Œ all, you know, ready to Œ to fight the war. So my friend say, what we gonna do now? We can™t get out. He said, we stay here until night time, at night time, we™ll get out of the town at night time. So we stayed there until it got dark. And as I walked out, the Œ the carriage made noise, because there was no oil. It made eh, eh, eh. So Œ so he says, what are we gonna do, it makes too much noise. So we Œ we picked up the carriage and we dragged it a little bit, but then we let it down again, and it made noise. The Germans heard the noise, they came running with the machine guns in the dark. We saw them. As kids, you can see good at night. So Œ so w-we walked up the hill, we had to Œ from the fountain, we had to walk the hill towards the mountain. So we saw the German pointing at us, and he Œ he starts shooting. So we left the carriage go. The carriage went against a tree, th Œ and broke and the melon starts rolling. So the German starts shoot ing at the melons, he didn™t know what it was. He starts shooting at the melon, an d we escaped, you know, we got up in the mountain, we came back to the woods. So the kid told the French families that we went down and there is full of Germans. So they said, what are you doing in town? Interview with Andre Zalc July 23, 2009 28So he explains to them, we didn™t have enough food. Said, why didn™t you ask us? So they gave us food, know? And overnight , at night, there was a big for Œ a fight between the Americans and the Germans, like artillery and everything. And then Œ and then the next day they told us that the Œ the town is liberated. So we didn™t know, we thought we were the only two in the town, but there were the Œ the resistance was in town too, and they killed all the Germans, the 30 Germans, and they lined them up on the sidewalk like sardines, they™re sardines. And they took everything away from them in a blanket. You know, their possession, their rings, their lighters, their Œ their rifles, everything, their machine guns. They™re the Schmeisser machine gun, that was the Œ the best machine gun. And they took everything away, and they were all dead. And then they Œ they buried them outside the town, you know, they buried all the Germans, and when we came down from the mountains, they were all dead, y™know? And Œ and then they captured about hundred Œ 200 Germans, prisoners w ho surrendered to the Œ from the Œ from another part of the town. And they had them prisoner, and the resistance had to interrogate them. Every German was interrogated. There was [indecipherable] from the resistance just to write everything down. So they used to use me as translator, know, and interrogate all these German, everything was written down, all the Œ where they™re born, how m Œ how many years in the army and everything. Interview with Andre Zalc July 23, 2009 29And then one German, he was very scared, and he said that he comes from a socialist family, because he noticed that the resistance had the h-hammer and the sickle on their he Œ on their y Œ beret, you kn ow? So Œ so he says to Œ to me, we c Œ I Œ we Œ I come from a socialist family, don™t kill us, don™t kill us. So he was afraid the French resistance would kill him. So I told him, he says, yeah, today they™re all socialists, you know? And before, they were all Nazis, now they™re socialists, the guy Œ the officer of the resistance said. And then Œ and then as I interrogate the Germans, they took away this guy was very scared, and we interrogate them separately. And he says, the officer of the resistance, he says, ask him where the officers are. He said the officers, they in the wood, they wouldn™t surrender. He say, in which wood? He say, in the same wood where you captured us. So we surrounded the woods, and Œ and the offer Œ one officer came out, they had no food, he came out to eat some grapes outside the woods were Œ were grapes. And that was the time when the grapes are ripe, you know, August. So he Œ he took in the helmet some grapes and he came back. And they told him to stop, he wouldn™t stop, so they shot him. So the other officer came out, he said, Hans, Hans, was ist los? It mean, Hans, Hans, what happened? So they Œ so they told him to stop, so he wouldn™t stop, they shot him too. So they brought back the two German officers on the truck. The French truck, by the wheels they have like a Œ like a Œ the wheel is separated Interview with Andre Zalc July 23, 2009 30from the motor. There™s like a separation. So they put one officer this way, and one officer that way, and they brought them back to town. And they were bleeding all on the road, y™know, because when they got shot? And in town, the people were touching them with branches, you know, th e Œ was like a big news, that the officers got shot, know? And then Œ yeah, see? Again? Q: I™m sorry, we™re Œ A: It™s all right.

Then the Œ the French resistance took off the boots. The boots were leather, and leather was like gold in those days. So most of the ki ds were barefooted, there was no Œ we had Interview with Andre Zalc July 23, 2009 32no shoes. So they gave me the boots to ma ke su Œ to give it to the shoemaker to make some Œ some shoes. So they gave me the boots, and one boot was full of blood. So we Œ I tried to wash it with my friend by the fountain with powder and everything, but we couldn™t get it clean. We couldn™t get it clean, so that boot we had to throw away. But the three other boots, I gave to a Spanish shoemaker who lived in the town, he was from the Civil War, he was very good sa Œ sh Œ shoemaker. He made me sandals for me and Lucie, you know? Sandals. And the sole, he used the sole from the Œ the belt from the mines, you know, the rubber belts that they used in the mine for the coal? He used. And the top was all leather from the boots. And he kept the leather, leftover leather he kept it for himself to make shoes, so he didn™t Œ it didn™t cost us nothing, the sandals. So he made sandals for me and Lucie and we had the sandals way back to Belgium we had those sandals. They were made like unbelievable. And th at was the Œ the profit because through me they got the German officers. If not they wouldn™t know the German officers were in the woods, you know? So Œ and then the Œ they had the German prisoners, they didn™t kill them. They turn them over to the Americans much later, know? They use them. Because I met some of those German soldiers who were Œ that I interrogate, I met them later in Marseilles. They used to clean the beach, the mines on the beach. And then in Marseilles Œ I came to live in Marseilles. From Tresse I Interview with Andre Zalc July 23, 2009 33went to live in Marseilles. In Marseilles there was no room, there was no apartments.
