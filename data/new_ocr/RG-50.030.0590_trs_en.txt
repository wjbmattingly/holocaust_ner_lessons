A: They write like a village very often. It was, you know, I am now a little surprised, because I have two monuments. One monument was done very soon after the end of the war, and all the years what we were knowing from Moscow to Vilnius, and then to Serei to this place, once a year definitely, in the summer, there was a monument. I have this monument and it was written that in this place was killed Œ were killed 100,900 people; men, women and children. They say by N azis and the other collaborators. Q: Local collaborators. A: Yeah, local. And then they changed this monument. I didn™t see the new one because we already couldn™t go. And another lady, two ladies went from Vilnius, they are now in Israel, and they sent me the picture. But I never could read what is written. And somewhere I found, because I have materials of Chana(ph) Slovatitsky(ph). She went Œ she came to America about Œ she was maybe 11 years old, because she had here a Uncle [indecipherable] , Dr. [indecipherable] . And he had to help her, she was Œ she had such a Œ Q: Hunchback, or she wa Œ Interview with Frida Ruderman October 15, 2010 20A: Yeah, she couldn™t straighten out, and he helped her. And finally, I tried to see her. And I was in Chicago , because she lived in Chicago, but I saw in Chicago another Serei woman, a woman from Serei, and she was out of town, and I don™t know why, maybe because she left very young, I was dreaming to see her, because she was my friend, despite the differences Œ Q: Age. A: Yes, I was older. But she didn™t try, so I didn™t see her. But she went to Serei later, and I have ever ything about her visit. Q: Okay. A: And there is a lot of new things, and there I saw what is written now. Q: What is written now? A: Now is written, first of all, not thousand, not 900, but 953, if I remember right. Q: Okay. A: And it says that that were Jews. Q: Rather than just Œ A: Jewish rather than the Œ maybe there was right, the first one, may there were some other people, I don™t know. Q: Yeah. Interview with Frida Ruderman October 15, 2010 21A: I can™t understand, and I even don™ t know who to ask why. Before we were going very often. Q: I can see whether we can find out for you, as far as th-the Œ the research that™s been done for that part, for Serei and the surrounding regions. Usually by now there has been some sort of investigation to find out more detail. A: The real numbers. Q: The real numbers. A: Maybe something changed. Q: Yeah. A: I mean, there™s 900 Œ 953, if I reme mber right, approximately, but at least two times less. Q: Yes. But my question is, how large was the community before the war, the Jewish community in Serei? Was it a thousand people, was it several hundred? A: Well, they were writing that it was 1900. Q: No, no, no, I™m not talking about those who were murdered, I™m talking about the town before World War II, or the village before World War II, about how large was it? Was it a big village, was it a small village? Were Interview with Frida Ruderman October 15, 2010 22there hundreds of people, were there thousands of people who lived in it? Do you remember? A: Th-Th Œ I Œ I don™t remember simple I didn™t come, but I have Œ I have materials where it shows that it wa s exactly, because everybody was murdered. Only seven people survived from Serei, seven. Q: Seven. A: I am in this number in Serei. My cousin Etta, that is also Etta, who is my father™s brother™s daughter Œ Q: Yes. A: Œ she was in Vilnius, and she survived. And then a few more, they were not in Serei, and only one who was this morning, the 22 nd of June morning, because Nazis were in Serei in the morning of 22. And in Alytaus they were about two, three o™clock, so. Q: In the afternoon? A: The afternoon, yes. Q: I see. A: So one only because he had a mo torcycle. And I talked to him. Q: Okay. A: I saw him one time. Interview with Frida Ruderman October 15, 2010 23Q: So what you™re explaining to me is that you™re not sure about how many people there were Œ Jews there were in Serei. There could have been a 1,900 some, or it could have been this 900 figure. A: Yeah, now it changed. Q: Yeah, it could be one, it could be the other, but you know that only seven survived Œ survived.
