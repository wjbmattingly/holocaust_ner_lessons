Q: Any of them from the Exodus? A: Yeah. Q: So you were really with the same group the whole time. A: I had a cousin. I don't know if she's still alive. She went from Brooklyn to Florida to live because of children and this. We were in touch not for a long time. I don't know now. I don't--I lost the--the--lost touch with her. Q: But she was with you on the Exodus and at the kibbutz? A: Yeah. Q: What was her name? A: She wasn't in touch with me anymor e, but we found each other in Brooklyn. Q: What was her name, or what is her name? A: Dora Lebovitz (ph). But she was--the Lebovitz was after her husband. The first name before, I don't know her name. But Dorry (ph). We call Dorry.

I was with children. Q: And did you talk about your experience? A: Oh, yeah. We always used to talk about it. Some people didn't believe that the English did that to us. Even now they don't believe there was an Exodus. A lot of people. I think so. Q: So you--you--you--actually--you talked about your specific experience on the Exodus. A: Yes, yes. A lot. But, you know, when we came--when we came--then right away to war. They got killed. I knew a boy--we were--we were, you know, on the ship, were also together talking and that he died the next day when he went to war. Q: You--you mean in--in Palestine. A: In Palestine. He was 17 years old. And a lot of--of--a lot of people got killed right away. Q: And how--how did you feel about that, as a survivor who had already survived so much, then participating in fighting? A: They said they have to fight. They have to fight because we suffered so much and they killed our--our parents, our families. So we had to fight. And the Haganah told us, it's going to be ours, you know. So we going to have a home here and we going to live here and that's what we felt. And everybody who didn't go, we wo rked hard, you know. Because--the men mostly. In every kibbutz and in every moshav, they went to war. So whoever could went to help them, you know. I didn't go because for one purpose because they told me I was going to have a baby, you know. So I said ____+ what am I going to do. So I didn't go. A lot didn't go away. Girls, not men. All the men--all the younger boys went. And a few survived. And we got in touch. And I was sick anyway. Because they hit me in the--in the concentration camp, they hit me on the head, and I was fainting a lot from that. Q: You were fainting a lot? A: Yes.

Q: So--but there was no--I mean were there doctors on the boat that helped take care of you, or what was the situation like? A: No. No, not really. No, no. Maybe ther e was. I don't know. They didn't help me. Q: Okay. I think that covers--I'm trying to th ink if there's anything else that we didn't cover because you've already done another oral history where I think we have all the information. We just didn't get everyt hing about your experience on the Exodus. A: Yes. I--I--yeah, from Spielberg. I was interviewed for two hours, yes. Q: Yes, I watched it.

And I'm sure--you know, stay in touch with the museum. But I appreciate you taking the time to cove r the history today. A: Thank you very much. I got pictures fro m the Exodus. My--my grandson gave it to me. I don't know from which museum they se nd it to me. Very nice. The whole ship. Q: I saw that you had one that you showed in your other oral history. There was a photograph. A: Yes, there was a photograph. I--I saw it--I was sitting by doctor's ____+ in the office. And I used to--now I cannot see. I have macular degeneration.
