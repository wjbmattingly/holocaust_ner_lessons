3 The scary part that I remember was recess. We had to go out for recess. That was considered dangerous. We usually tried to stay very close to our teachers between the boys and the girls who were separated -- separated and couldn't wait until recess was over. It was scary. We also were told to get to school about five minutes later than anybody else. We were dismissed about five minutes earlier. It was dangerous. People were beaten up. Especially, we became noticeable as groups. Individually I went all over but as groups, you were too easily identified. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: How did your teachers treat you? >> Frank Liebermann: They were authoritarian here, especially my second grade teacher. The fir st grade was Miss David who was very motherly. The second one was an autocrat. >> [Laughter] >> Frank Liebermann: I could say probably German mentality. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: In 1936, I know that the situation for your family became much more difficult and dangerous. Do you want to say a little bit about the year 1936 and what that meant for your family? >> Frank Liebermann: If you study history, you will know that after World War I there was a Crimean War which led to the establishment of Poland as a country betwee n Russia and Germany. The borders were unofficial. Gliwice was very close to the border. The areas within a certain distance of the borders were protected by the treaty against any prejudice because it gave each country 15 years -- it gave the Germans a chance to get out of Poland. That treaty was over in 1936. We were warned to be careful. At that time my father lost his hospital privileges. Shortly beforehand my parents told me that we might take an ocean voyage and I better learn to swim. And that the swimming pool would be closed after 1930, closed to us i n 1936. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: Closed to the Jewish. >> Frank Liebermann: Yes. As well as certain events, institutions, like movies, similar places. I remember that, I think, in May of 19 36, my grandfather came with me to the pool and said , ﬁI 'm not leaving here until you take a test in deep water. ﬂ >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: Oh, boy. [Laughter] >> Frank Liebermann: I've enjoyed swimming ever since. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: Your father lost his ability to practice as a surgeon. What happened to his practice and his office? >> Frank Liebermann: Well, number one, he couldn't use the hospital. The German system depended on health insurance which became closed to him. So we were fortu nate -- we got early warning that things were going to get worse. My parents started seriously to look for choices to go. Eventually my grandfather on my mother's side, was a genealogist, and he discovered a distant relative who was kind of the black sheep of the family who had emigrated to the United States in 1905 a nd was living in New York. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: Ok. >> Frank Liebermann: January 1938, after doing thorough investigations, my father went to the United States, also to look up other relatives because being a genealogist . One of the women on my mother's side, married Michael Grant, who was one of the pioneer families to settle in Philadelphia. And in fact, they established a college in Philadelphia. Among other things, my father wen t to the Archives to find out what happened to the family. Unfortunately, stayed a single woman and her brother emigrated to the west; namely , Louisville, Kentucky. They lost trace. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: How did your family make ends meet between 1936 and 1938? >> Frank Liebermann: That was tough. Basically, in order to get a visa to the United States you had to get an affidavit from somebody that you won't be on welfare for a year. The time was 1938, which was the second part of the Great Depre ssion. The way we support -- actually, my parents bought first class tickets on a German boat because there you could get a pretty substantial spending allowance to be used on the trip. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: Ahh. 4 >> Frank Liebermann: That basically supported us probably for the first year of our residence because we never used any of the affidavit giver's funds during that time. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: And your father was able to leave in June 1938? >> Frank Liebermann: We got the affidavit in January and we got a number to be on the list of people applying. The quota for Germany was 25,000 people. Obviously there were many more who wanted to go. That's the reason the affidavits were very, very restrictive. Generally, by the way, that quota was not filled for that reason. Actually, nothing happened. My father called a friend of his in Berlin and said , ﬁWhat's happening? I've had this number. Do you have any idea how I can find out how long this is going to last because things aren't gett ing any better? ﬂ He said , ﬁW ell, the coun sel has a secretary by the name of Fraulein Schmidt. If you get her a nice box of candy, maybe that's going to help. ﬂ >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: [Laughter] >> Frank Liebermann: A month later nothing happened. He called his friend again and he said , ﬁW ell, did you put a hundred marks into the box of candy? ﬂ And my father was a very straight and narrow and he said, "I didn't know you had to do that." He got a second box of candy. About a week later we were calle d to get a physical at the American Embassy. We got the visa in June. It was good for 120 days. Since my father had to take state boards in order to practice in the United States, my mother was left to close the household and we took our tickets at the end of the 120 days because all funds -- all bank accounts were frozen in 1936. You could only take out enough for living -- what was determined living expenses. And anything over that made you subject to arrest. You couldn't take any money out of Germa ny. The amount was 10 marks, which is about $2.50 a person. That explains how we managed and why I think my father was studying in Cleveland he had a room for $5 a week. We lived frugally and survived. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: What was that like in those 120 days where your father had left and you and your mother were still in Germany? >> Frank Liebermann: Tough. First of all, the family was broken. We had already given up the apartment. In fact, we had quite an incident over that. The equivalent of the lease is that you give the landlord mortgage. After all, he had an office and he wanted to make sure that he didn't have to move short -term. When you canceled the lease, the money was refunded and he asked for it to be transferred to his bank. Somebody at the landlord's bank notified the Gestapo that somebody made a large withdrawal from the bank and they said investigate. Two agents came in and said " Yo u're under arrest." We said, "F or what?" For withdrawing funds. Said they were transfer to my bank. Very fortunate. He called his bank and the bank president vouched that they got the deposit and that it is still in the account. And they left us. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: Thank God. >> Frank Liebermann: When we were ready to pack -- at tha t time we could still take belongings in the lift, which is like a container, providing we paid 100% tax of whatever we had. And it had to be used. We did take most of our smaller furniture, office supplies; in other words, instruments. And my mother als o bought a sewing machine that in case things got rough, she could sew our own clothes. That was packed up with a customs inspector when the time came who was then checked on. We also had a pretty tough experience at that time. There was a house which had a backyard which was converted into a playground where we played tag. I promptly broke my arm. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: Oh, no. >> Frank Liebermann: At that time one did not call -- there was no 911. One didn't call the police because the police were not your friends. So I did something which we would consider outrageous. I took my bicycle and rode home holding my arm like this. This is on the main street, like Connecticut Avenue, except it didn't have a lot of cars. So it wasn't heavy traffic . >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: [Laughter] >> Frank Liebermann: So my mother got on the phone and called the local orthopedist. And he said, "I 'm sorry. I don't take Jewish patients." She frantically got on the phone and found somebody in my father's hometown who said, " Look, I'll take care of you. Take a taxi to the backdoor of the Catholic 5 orphanage. I'll meet you there." Which we did. He set my arm, put it in a cast. My pediatrician took care of it after six weeks to try to get the movement back. We developed instinct on what we can and can't do. That's how we adapted. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: So you're 9 or 10 years old, I believe, when you boarded the ship with your mother to come to the United States. >> Frank Liebermann: Yes. >> Suzanne Br own -Fleming: What was the journey like? >> Frank Liebermann: It was in October 1938 during hurricane season. >> [Laughter] >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: Oh, no. [Laughter] >> Frank Liebermann: We had the cheapest first class seat, cabin, which was in the extreme front of the boat. I remember -- so that you had that elevator effect going up and down. In fact, I was fascinated by watching from the promenade deck as the bow of the ship literally dove into the waves and then came up and when it got to the water level, it made a quick jump up. It was fascinating but it was not comfortable at night. And my mother never left the cabin during the whole week until we were close to arrival. At one time I was one of simple in the first class dining room. The other five sat at the captain's table. I had my own table. [Laughter] >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: What was it like to see your father again? >> Frank Liebermann: Oh, he met us in New York. We had a wonderful reunion. He introduced me to the American drink which was a Coke. I thought it was cocoa. [Laughter] And we promptly went to Cleveland. My father had rented a small, one -bedroom apartment with a Murphy bed, which was my introduction to sleeping in the United States. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: Oh my gosh. >> Frank Liebermann: I still think fondly about that. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: And what happened to all the family that was not able to take a ship to the United States? >> Frank Liebermann: Well, on November 6, my parents took advantage -- I think it was a Wednesday where there was a movie special of 10 cents per person. Remember, we have had a lot of inflation. In those days you could buy a car for under $1,000. They asked a neighbor to kind of look in on me. They told me they would be b ack around 10:00. At maybe 8:30, the phone rang. The person called for my grandparents. 8:30 was 2:30 in the morning so I knew enough that this was not an ordinary call. It was a person -to-person call for my mother. That was the longest hour that I re member in my life. When they finally did come home, they found out that my mother's brothers had been arrested, that the business had been confiscated. This was Kristallnacht, which was the beginning of the Holocaust. It was called the Night of Broken Glass, when all windows were smashed, synagogues were burned, and the Holocaust became serious. I said I consider myself a witness because I was fortunate due to our early warning we got out before all hell broke loose. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: Were any other family members able to get out of Germany besides your father and your mother and yourself? >> Frank Liebermann: Unfortunately not because my father immediately went to the person who gave us the affidavit. I found out he had a history -- I said he was a black sheep. His father came to my great grandfather in 1905 and said he simply needed to borrow $3,000, which was a lot of money. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: Yeah. >> Frank Liebermann: For the week. He never -- he took the next ship to the United States not to be heard from again and almost was close to driving the business to bankruptcy. But they did survive. When my father went to see the son, he said , ﬁI'm sorry, I already have responsibility for you ,ﬂ even though he never gave a penny. My grandparents were too close and not having any funds of our own we really weren't able to help. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: That must have been very frustrating. 6 >> Frank Liebermann: Yeah. Furthermore, in 1941, my parents were able to get help in gettin g my grandfather, on my father's side, who was a single person -- was supposed to be able to get out from Spain and Portugal. He got sick on the way. Instead of being taken for medical treatment, he was shipped to Theresienstadt where he died. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: A concentration camp in today's Czechoslovakia. >> Frank Liebermann: My mother's brothers were on an Italian ship in I think June of 1940 when the Nazis broke through in the -- it was decided it was a good time to declare war on the allies because it was safe. And the ship never got through the Suez Canal and went back. We never heard from them again after that. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: And what was life like for you in the United States in those first years? >> Frank Liebermann: I adapted pretty well. Fortunately my father passed his state boards that December i n 1938. His friend in Cleveland had an office with an ear, nose, throat specialist and suggested that it would be very good if they moved -- if he moved to Dayton where there was no Jewish ear, nose, throat specialist. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: [Laughter] Very good advice? >> Frank Liebermann: It was very good advice because he did do, after a tough first year, did very well in Dayton. Even though the first year was very tough. He opened his office on Valentine's Day a nd immediately applied to the Medical Society which was the sign of legitimacy if you became a member. The following week the Medical Society decided to convene an emergency meeting on a Friday night, whic h is Jewish Shabbat and passed the law requiring citizenship for membership. The cost to citizenship is five years after filing first papers. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: This was a way of keeping Jewish members out. >> Frank Liebermann: The following day, a reporter for "T he Dayton Herald," which was one of the two main newspapers, gave him a ring and said, " Doctor, I'd like to see you. I'd like to see your credentials." So he said , fine, come over any time. He was not busy at that time. >> Suzanne Brow nFleming: [Laughter] >> Frank Liebermann: And he went through. He studied that he passed the state boards on first trial. The next day "The Dayton Herald" had a Sunday editorial, "Freedom of Opportunity in the United States." The next day, the next Monday, he had 11 new patients. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: Fantastic. >> Frank Liebermann: That really started his practice. He was quite successful. Also, the Chief of Staff of Good Samaritan Hospital gave him hospital privileges even though he was not a member of the Medical Society. He stayed on the senior staff until he retired in 1972. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: Well, I think we have time to open this session to the audience if you're willing to take questions. >> Frank Liebermann: Fine. >> Suz anne Brown -Fleming: So that everybody understands to stick around, we're going to give Frank the last word. We have 15 minutes or so for questions. And then we will give Frank an opportunity to have the last word here. There are microphones on the right and the left. If you want to raise your hand and ask a question. I will repeat the question so we are sure everybody hears it. I can't see from here who is raising their hand, unfortunately. I see a couple in the back. >> I have a question about what languages did you speak at home growing up and how was that transition moving to the United States, learning English . >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: I'll just repeat the question to make sure it's clear, if I understand the question. What languages you had and how -- what languages you had to learn in the United States. >> Frank Liebermann: Well, my parents both learned English and French in their high school and junior college. I got English -- they had a friend who spoke English. I had an English tuto r for about the last two, three months. I'm a visual person. I'm not that good with languages. But it was good enough that we did not speak German at home from the time we arrived. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: Wow. 7 >> Frank Liebermann: In other words, we -- this was where we belonged. I started school. They put me half a year back, I remember in 3B. By the time I got to Dayton I had caught up. In fact, I skipped a year. I was one of the younger ones in my class when I graduated. >> Suzanne Brown -Fle ming: Any other hands? >> Frank Liebermann: Since I don't have a good ear for language, by the way, that's why I still have an accent. >> [Laughter] >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: I think I might have -- a couple of hands here. >> What is one of your favorite moments as a child living in America? >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: Favorite moment as a child living in America. >> Frank Liebermann: I have no favorites. >> [Laughter] >> Frank Liebermann: This is where I belonged. I did -- sightseeing in New York, where for 5 cents we took one of the double -decker buses on 5th A venue. That was my treat. It basically covered all of New York. I said I have no favorites. The minute we arrived this was my home. In fact, I'd say part of my last word, which I usually save for the end but it's appropriate for the question. I was back 20 years ago just to see what it was like. I pinched myself. How could I possibly have been part of that? I've been able to live the American dream. In spite of all the things whic h happened, I feel I've got three wonderful kids, five grandchildren. My daughter is over there. All the moments are my favorite. Also, we traveled extensively to know the country well. This is part of the background that I'm still a travel agent. I think I've been to 46 of the 50 states. I have nothing but good things to say. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: The little girl over here. >> Hello. How were you treated when you got to the United States in school? How did that change over time or did it ch ange? >> Frank Liebermann: I never knew that I had an accent. >> [Laughter] >> Frank Liebermann: I went through school pretty much with flying colors. Of course, the times were from Depression through World War II. That's why I say -- I'd like to add one other thing which I want you to know about Germany. A dictatorship leads to a tremendous amount of corruption. In other words, when times are bad -- when I talked about Fraulein Schmidt, that's not alone. Hundreds of people were given visas by counsels which were invalid. You heard of people going on to St. Louis with fake visas. One of the lessons that I tried to persuade people to listen to is that when times are bad, people look for quick fixes. Quick fixes can be also dangerous. That's what I consider particularly important. That's why I volunteer here. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: We still have time for more questions. >> Frank Liebermann: This young lady had a question. [Laughter] >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: We promise we'll get to you. >> Frank Liebermann: You're next. >> When you came to the United States, how or where were you -- what was actually going on in Germany or in your own town? >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: I'm just going to repeat the question for the sake of the transcriber. The question was, when you came to the United States, how aware were you of events that continued to culminate into the Holocaust in Germany? >> Frank Liebermann: You could write weekly letters until World War II. In other words, you address ed it to ce rtain boats. We knew that things were tough but they were heavily censored. Everything was, for instance, from Theresienstadt where maybe once or twice a year one would get letters. My grandparents wrote that we were doing so well, we gained weight, we now weigh 120 pounds. M y grandfather weighed 175. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: Letters from the concentration camp. 8 >> Frank Liebermann: Everything was written in code. Rumors were pretty substantial but very little was verified. We did finally find out -- as I said, we never heard from my mother's brothers. I did find verification that they were sent to Auschwitz. My grandparents were sent to Auschwitz in 1940, 1944. It became obvious what was happening. But I'd also like to say that due to World War II that was not the primary focus of the United States government, which was essentially to defeat Germany. This young lady. >> Answered my question. >> Frank Liebermann: Ok. >> Is there anything about Germany that you miss? >> Frank Liebermann: Frankly, no. >> [Laughter] >> Frank Liebermann: Although -- I'm a travel agent. I enjoy traveling. I'm doing it. That pays for my trips. Sometimes -- I've been retired for 20 years. I've kind of made peace with Germany. It's now three generations and I'm absolutely appalled over the fact that when I went to school, the Civil War was ancient history. Today, 1940 is about the same timeframe. I try to keep that in mind when I speak to young people. But the lessons that we get from it is that we basically have to defend our hard -earned rights. I miss nothing about my history. >> As someone who battled segregation from a kid and then living here, how were you affected during the `60s when we as a country had such a battle against segregation? >> Suza nne Brown -Fleming: I'm going to repeat the question for the transcriber. The question is how and whether you were affected by the fights for desegregation here in the United States given your own history. >> Frank Liebermann: One of my biggest shocks was that in 1941, in the summer, we took our first vacation from Dayt on, Ohio. We went down to the Smokies and stopped to -- at one of the tribes of the new deal which was Tennessee valley, a system of dams. We stopped at one of the bigger dams. We had to go to the restroom. I saw four doors which were ladies, gentlemen, colored women, colored men. I still see that picture. I am extremely sensitive to any kind of prejudice. That's kind of been a guide, as far as I'm concerned, that I have to watch my moral compass to see that everybody gets a fair shake. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: We probably have time for one or two more. >> Have you ever gone back to Germany? If so, where are some of the places you visited there? >> Frank Liebermann: First of all, I went back to my hometown, which is not Germany anymore. It's now Poland. Because the borders were changed during -- after World War II. I went there on business a couple of times. I really tried to avoid it. But when we went over -- when the memo rial was established in Gliwice, I mentioned I took my family to. We met in Berlin. I swore I would hate and I couldn't do it. That's why I say about the generations. First of all, the people you hate don't know it. So it's absolutely a counterproductive procedure. It only hurts yourself. Because it limits you. It's also why I volunteer here. Did I answer? Oh, I went one further. I took my first vacation where we touched Germany which was three years ago. We went from Amsterdam to -- it was part Holland, part Germany, part France. I felt I have to accept everybody for who this is and you can't categorize anybody. I am on the extreme side of not only talents but liking what I see in human beings. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: I'm going to turn bac k to Mr. Liebermann in a moment to close our program. I'd like to thank all of you for being here and hope you come back. We have First Person program every Wednesday and every Thursday until the middle of August. Even though you said you had mentioned your last word already, all the same, you'll still get another shot at another last word. I'd like to let the audience know that you'll be around after this program for a few minutes on the stage if would like to ask Mr. Liebermann questions personally. One last housekeeping item. After Frank closes our program I'm going to ask all of you stand. Our photographer, Joel, is going to come up on stage and take a photograph of Frank with you as the background. 9 So let's give Frank the last word. And then if we can stand for the photograph, that would be terrific. >> Frank Liebermann: All I want to say is I wish everybody here the same good wishes for living the American dream. I just feel it's a great place to live. I grew up in Dayton, Ohio. I lived in New York and then moved here because I had four baby grandchildren of my two daughters. I've loved every minute of it. [Applause]
