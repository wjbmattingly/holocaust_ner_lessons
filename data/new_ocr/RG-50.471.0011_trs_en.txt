you were already a criminal. So my father took an occupation after being a watchman. That was the only way he could get away without working on Saturday. Later on, we saw that this wasn't the answer. We opened what we call the little restaurant in our house. We had a big apartment with a big dining room so we made a little restaurant. Actually this was a cover so you can--people can come in without doing any suspi- cion. And between then they did a little business on the side. If anybody strange or any stranger--anybody unknown use to come in, everybody would sh--shocked white. Nobody would say a word. And just eat a meal, get pay--pay the big and then get out. That went in 19--that was 1940. Before the war--when the war broke out. That was uh Saturday night or Sunday morning, I remember that the Sunday evening we had a meeting in our house and they had to decide. My father and a lot of friends came in the house. Should we run or should we stay and wait the Germans to come in.

But even without knowing that, they decided not to run because we hated the Russians to run because they were no better than the Germans. So the decision was not to run. Those who did run unfortunately didn't make it. Uh, it was a couple months that the Germans sent us to the ghetto. The Germans came in I think it was Wednes- day morning or Tuesday morning or Wednesday morning in Kovno. Um the time before went into the ghetto, they use to come into my house--our house to pray in the morning and they needed a median which called a qur--quorum--10 people. So people even from the house or from very close by, use to sneak into our house to pray. When they were in middle of praying, they saw a German officer comes in. I don't know what he knew but he came to father and looked at the--the--the are in the are gobbed with the film intelation. And all of a sudden, he comes to us said, 'Do you have a Shohanora?' Which is a uh actually the code of the Jewish Law. My father was amazed that a German officer should ask him a question like that. He gave--showed to him. He put it back in the suitcase and left. It didn't take more than 5 minutes. A whole group of German officers came in and questioned, 'Was anybody here? Did he demand anything? Did he ask for anything?' And that's when again interrupted the players. They didn't say any- thing and left.

It didn't take long. I think uh, in the middle of the summer and everybody was supposed to find a place and get there. They designat- ed an area and all of the Jews had to move there. Looking around where to find a place to--to move wasn't easy. The Lithuanians that had to move out from that area weren't too happy either. However, my father had owned a building. I think a 16 family house--what we called a Greenenbahg--the 'Green Mountain' in Kovno. And looking for a place, he found uh a uh Lithuanian that had a 4 family house--a 5 family house--4 families and an attic. And he said, 'How about making an ex- change. Here I give you a big house--16 families--a real income house for this little hut that you had without whatever.

So only what we did necess--the most important things that we could think of, we took along with us. Among the things that we took with us was, somehow in a we had a--a valise with wheat--namgut wheat.

Kovno was like a peninsula. It had two rivers on either side of the town. And--and at the end of the town the two rivers met. The one river was the Namen dead on the Valir. Slabotka was on the other side of the Valir. That's where the Kovno ghetto was. While going there to look for a place that we had to move into the ghetto, we walked into some of the abandoned houses that Jewish people leave before and the blood that we saw in the beds; beds unmade; cribs full with blood stains--in the cribs and that was right after the Germans came in. The Lithuanians themselves made sets of pogroms. They went through Jewish houses, killing everybody--old, young, babies in the cribs.

The--the--the joke was that when the Germans were coming because they--they are banging on it--the way they were walking--you could hear for--for a block away. Uh--uh--the only problem was in ghetto, in the street that we live was not paved. It was scent and uh but if you saw a German from 3 blocks away, you hid.

But gave him a job, in the ghetto, because they needed him.

BZ: The humiliation--once while he was in the store, behind the counter, a German came in. And through seeing my father with a beard, pulled out his sword and cut it off a half a beard. And he wanted to go further but somehow from the outside, somebody called him, so he left him like this. My father being a religious man and didn't care, you know, that he would not give in to their--so he would not even straighten out his beard. Half of it was cut off--he took a scarf, wrapped in around his face and that's the way he wa--he was walk- ing, till the beard grow back. But he wouldn't cut it.

It was uh--uh--uh I don't--was raining what was a cold uh damp day. And uh stayed until late in the evening and then we were sent back to the house. For my family, my uncle uh Mihnk's family--only 3 children were left on the right side--the right side; the rest of the family on the left. So these 3 children later moved into with our--with us in the 2 rooms. We had the the--the kitchen in the room and the partitions of the kitchen. These 3--these 3 slept behind the partition in the kitchen. While we meaning my--my parents and two more brothers, myself slept in one room in the other room. It means at night, the room became one bed. 12 were larger than a meter. And in the morning, they use to put it together because they wanted to make a quorum, a meeting in the house, even in ghetto. So the, every- thing was posed on the side and the 10 people used to come in and used to play down right there.

That if you're not there and you survived it, you have a bet--better chance to stay surviving instead of going to a selection. So what we started doing is make hiding places; wuntas as we called. And of course not every house or every place could or was suitable so we teamed up with a neighbor across the street from us who had a little house. And uh the uh water source was a well in the yard and next to the house would be 10-12 feet away from the house was a barn. That we kept uh wood if you had any--anything to keep there. So we decided to dig up the barn, make like a--a uh bunker underneath, cover it up with what ever wood we could and cover it up with the dirt and uh dig a tunnel because once you went into that little house the vesti- bule had like a cold basement.

The--the broke through a wall in--in--in the cement, dug a tunnel from there to the uh room that was actually underneath that barn. Now they needed any kind of supplies. The--the wall was very close by so they made it so that they took all the first around from the well, covered it up and put the well also into the bunker. Not nowhere and they were taking water from our well that we had in the backyard. By the Klay--Kinder Actia and that was already forty ehh in '44. And then in Jewish date it was 2 days the Kinder Actia. That was the 3rd and the 4th day of the month of Yessin. We were hidden there in that bunker. However a parent of one of the people of our neighbor somehow were found that somewhere else and in order to be released or he'll thought he will be released, he snitched on us so they let should let him go. So the last--the second day of he Kinder Actia, in the late in the afternoon, all of a sudden they started banging on the wall because they already found us out. They--they wouldn't of found it unless somebody pointed a finger. And that is the one who pointed the finger at us. They took us all out and that when my father and my younger brother were taken away. Before that, when I was about 14, that was means 2 years in the ghetto, they also realized that if you have a profession or you're employed, you had a better chance of survival--at least on a day to day basis.

So much so that what we were doing there was for half-houses we used to make the cans--the spray cans or milk cans. So it made it turning the uh medal and also uh soldering. I could answer first that it's not how you holding the solder iron or you leading the solder but how you apply the acid before and that's how the solder will be. When I once went bought in a utensil finished. It was only about 2 months after I started--you know not even 2 months and I showed him that I did--I finished it--the foreman couldn't believe it. You couldn't do it. He wouldn't trust me--said he accused me that somebody else did it for me. Till he went in the shop with me and I showed him how I solder that just like a string. That convinced him yet that I did it. In a month later he made me the foreman for the whole shop. That was what I did in the ghetto after I was 14. My father were doing in that time, as I said before in the bak- ery. But then they were short in people to sent out for certain jobs outside of the ghetto and they didn't have enough could they send and they had to--to say that the men would of give me 60 men or a hundred men or 300 men and they were short, they'd grab whatever they could. So even my father who was employed in the ghetto had to go out--outside. Usually he did not go outside the ghetto. The problem was that this was a winter and they used to go out when it was dark and you know, father was very religious and he had to put down that film.

Of course the peeling potatoes and the peels they bring them home. And uh imagine that being that uh they needed the peels so that they get go home, they peeled a little heavier. But this was a uh one of the sustaining things--potato peels that came from kitchens and that way use to be washed, cooked, and all kinds of food made out of it. Even if you had to burn a little flour and make uh Kanadlak--you know, Kanad- lakha--uh potato rolls. And they put in hot water and boil it and make soup out of it.

I personally as a kid, I was 9 or 10 years old, when I had a incident and that I met him and that was because there was a summer place, not far from Kovno, called Callituba. And he use to stay in a villa there. And we were also, for the summer, in that place. One day I went in the street and I see him going out for a walk. I went over. I was very blatant as a young kid and I said, 'Good morning Kovno Role.' He took me for his hand and for a hour, he walked with me; asking me all kinds of questions and family. So I had a big honor and unusual that I had me that know--know him in person. He was very learn scholar for what I have in his book from Varabum.

At that time we were already too num to look for shel- ter, to look for bunkers, to hide. Some did hide and survived. Some hid and did not make it because a lot of the houses were burned to the ground. But they had a suspicion, anybody hiding there, they burned the--the uh houses to the ground when the ghetto was liquidated. But I understand about 7000 people, that they were liquidated from the ghetto and they took us into to--to uh the--the uh freight trains and it came--we came to Studhoff. That's where they separated the women from the and the children from the--from the other men. My brother wanted to go with my mother and my mother wouldn't let him. She understood that a better chance for--even for a young kid, to be with the men in a working camp rather than to go with the women. And he wanted to go with mother--mother pushed him away. I uh you can imagine how hard for a mother to push away a child. But she figured that this is a better chance. From my mother, I never heard since. And I did hear about her that she was still alive. Eh in the begin- ning of the winter of uh 1944/45. A couple weeks after Sutkiss, somebody still saw her in--in--in that camp but uh near Studhoff. But after that we are never heard of her.

To describe this airport, after I look at it and being in construc- tion now, it was fabulous eh type of construction. The actually created a mountain, put a ten meter cover of solid cement with a reinforced with the--with the uh metal uh--metal rods. And afterwards, dug out the mountain from underneath--leaving a big large tunnel where two large planes can stay--can pass by each other side by side. And at the ends of the--at the side of it, the had the shops--the workshops. That was a fabulous idea. However, they did not finish it. My brother was sent in Auschwitz. I was sent in stayed in Dakaw till April. In April they took us back to when the--when the Americans came closer, the took us to Dakaw Proper and then from there afterwards we went on the Death march in Turoll and I was liberated in Tu- roll, May 5th. My brother I didn't find. Especially I didn't find him till the--the day before Yom Kipper of 1945, which is quite a few months after liberation. But I did hear about him in uh about 2 months or 3 months after the war ended that he was in Salbergs. And so the whole story--the way I went to look for him--couldn't find him because he went with the trans- porter--that he thought was going to Lithuania and then he found it--it--it--it was not going to Lithuania, he skippped the transport and came back to Austria and that's the second time.

BZ: The way I understand, the committee in the ghetto, and that is Kovno ghetto, I think they--they were more loyal to the Jewish people to the in the ghetto than what I hear in other ghettos. They really transformed the ghetto in a work uh Laga--in a work force. Making the Germans, being dependent on the labor that the ghetto was providing. And I think that is maybe be one of the reasons that Kovno ghetto survived longer than other ghettos. Because after a while, they became to be dependent on the labor forces--use to go out to the ghetto in different areas to do--to perform work. In the ghetto there was the Kleineverstaten and the Klei- severstaten. The Kleineverstaten was doing the small things and also services.

And this was the idea in ghetto and that's why I think the Kovno ghetto survived longer than the other ones. With this in mind--that was the idea that I became a--a uh Tin Smith and I came--I came to a concentration camp in Dakaw. They asked, 'Do you have any professionals?' 'Yes, I am a Tin Smith.'

He was served the uh, also the refresh- ments whatever it was and then he was told that this is a Bar Mitsva of my brother. He was amazed and this is one of the two rights in the book.

Even so the song was something that expressed the hopeful- ness in the worst situations, we still the hope to--to God to ask him. So much so, that the man ends his book that he envys those who believe. And that was my father's character; to make somebody happy. I know of a other story that somebody would ask what are you doing on this street, you don't live here. People use to go out to work for a long long day from early morn- ing to night and that man used to pass by our house, said you don't live here what are you doing here? Said well I was hoping maybe I would meet Fivel Zisman and a few words would enliven me--would--would--would--would condole me for the next day or so. That was the char- acter of my father and that was the way people thought of him. To speak to him a few words was enough to uplift somebody and unfortunately with all the hope, some of them did not materialize. And he went perished in the Holocaust like so many other millions.

That when you looked at it, you see--you could see crack in the cement but you wouldn't not recognize that this was something like a door. You had to go on all four to creep into that and c--and uh 10/12 feet to go to that room that was dug out there in the room was made like uh a couple of beds like uh the one a top--one a top of the other. And that's the way if people see it set or--or laid down and there was also a problem with air. So there was a pipe in the back of that shed in the bushes there, we left a one pipe for air to--to--to--to have some air inside there. The tunnel was like a wide. It had a uh turn that it went to the--to the uh well and anytime you wanted to, you could fetch some water with a pail and a rope and from there it went back to the--to the shirt where under- neath the shirt, maybe two or three feet underneath there was two feet of dirt on top of it and underneath there, there was a bunker.

Bradley Wentworth Films, Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd, Potomac, MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: night. One night the well dissapeared. No--nobody knows there's any trace of it. That we covered. We took a couple of rings, covered it up and--and--and filled them with dirt. Make sure that the growth--the--the some growth on top of it like nothing--nothing before. And that was the--the--the bunker. While there, air was eh the biggest problem. We had also--in made a couple cans and--and--and the--the little food we did have and we spared something and right up make what we call uh Soccerringus. Made bright pieces of bread into cans, in case we have to stay there for more than Day or two, we would have something to--to nourish our- selves. Cuz we also left in cans in that bunker. But when they came in, we knew that we are found out, we had no choice but to get out of there. Had we staid there, ther would have blown up the whole thing. SB: And what did you do with the dirt when you...? BZ: The dirt that we put on the side and then put in on top and spread it out and put in--in--in--in on top of the well as well as there's a hole. The dirt was--it was problem when it was spread out over the gardens, especially if they did it in--in--in the uh the time that the--the--the--it was not uh the winter that people in there was big lots around the houses.

I mean a lot of interesting stories that I have in for instance, in ghetto, since I was Bar Mitsva I use put on it film everyday. In concentration camp, we only had one pair of film and that was my last day. Many times it use to be, he use to be--he use to work day--day--day shifts--night shift and the way you use to meet and pass by and--and--and they passed by, we passed over each other--that's why--all this was taking chances with your life because had you been caught you probably they put you up and shoot--shoot you. The damage was the biggest uh thing to make you an example. The--the--the if they--they uh hold somebody in the ghetto, the pulled everybody out and they in--in--on the lot in a--in a open field, an everybody had to run out for that--go out from the houses and watch uh somebody being hung.
