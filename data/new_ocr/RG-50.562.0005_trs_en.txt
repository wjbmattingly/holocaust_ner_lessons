And -- and chader, you know chader is a -- you know, the Jewish school. Q: And -- and how did this change after 1939? A: Well, it was good, it was -- w-we got along very good, and then it started out with the Jewish laws. Jewish laws means -- the first thing that I can remember was Jews couldn™t own no -- any government -- how do you call it, government store, like cigarettes. It -- it™s called a tra -- a traf -- I ca -- I can™t remember how that -- Q: Something that was licensed -- anything -- 11A: Licensed through the government -- Q: -- a store that was licensed for the government. A: Exactly. Like liquor, or cigarettes. So it started there. But we -- we got along fine, and then they started -- and then they called up my father to -- this wasn™t an army, it was a -- like a work force. So we were le ft, my -- my mother and I, and my -- my sister, we worked the horses, tried to do the same thing what my father done. Q: Do you know what year that was that he was -- A: That was about end of for -- 1940, or ™41. Q: And they took him away? A: Yeah, he went there, th -- they called him up. And he served near -- in Yugoslavia. Q: Oh, he went to Yugoslavia -- A: Yugosla -- Q: -- an-and the Hungarians took him there? A: Hungar -- it™s called -- in Hungarian it was called Munkasazat. Munkasazat , that means like a -- a working force, only you know, for -- and th ey used to wear yellow -- yellow bands. Q: And they were just Jews that were taken? A: All Jews were taken. Only Jews were taken for the Munkasa, for the working force, but if you were a Gentile you could go to the army. Because those days they called it -- they called up for the army because a wa -- the war was going on already. A lot of them went to Russia, you know, the war when Germany invaded Russia. 12Q: Did you hear from your father while he was away? A: Yeah, we used to -- I used to write letters, my mother used to dictate. And my mother could write, but my father couldn™t write, he was still illiterate. I used to write letters and -- and he used to send packages home, like I told you, he -- he sent even bread, he used to send home. Yeah, it was t ough, tough life. And those days, they -- they were rationed us. They rationed us. Th ey rationed everybody, not only the Jew, they rationed everybody. Coupons for bread, for anything, you know, like staple like meat and stuff like that, everything was rationed. Q: Did he send money home? A: No, no, no money, no mone y, just bread, crackers. Q: It must have been ve ry hard for your mother. A: Yeah, it was, it was, it was. We -- we lived off -- we -- we just hoped that the -- that the summer comes sooner so we can live off there, live off the land. Q: Did you stay in school during that period? A: Yeah, yeah, I stayed in school, but I quit school when I was already what, about 13 years old. After then, I w -- I took over, you know, full time working. Q: So, that would have been about what year? ™43? A: ™43, yeah. Yeah, it was the -- yeah, I remember I used to work with my -- with my yo -- with my sister, she was only a little younge r than me. We went to the river, and -- and she used to pile up all kinds of stones. When I used to take the stones to unload, she had to -- my brother and my sister had to pile the stones together so when I came -- 13so I could have a pile, you kn ow, I shouldn™t have to go and look for, you know, could load it up fast. Q: And during this time when your father was away, were you all alarmed? Was it frightening or just difficult? A: No, it was difficult, we -- we never -- it wasn™t -- we -- we accepted whatever life was. We accepted it, those things. We only -- only hope that we get a full stomach, that™s it. Life was very, very -- you didn™t think of those things. Q: And when did -- in your village then, when did changes start to come when Jewish laws i -- in force? A: Well it -- so then after -- after that my father came home and stayed home for a little while. Oh yes, they -- they asked in th -- in the camps, you know, where my father was, who wants to go home. So my father volunteered, so he came home. But a lot of people didn™t want to come home beca use they knew if they going to go home, they -- a lot of people knew that they -- they was -- what was going on, but we were very ignorant, we didn™t know. We didn™t know -- Q: You mean that Jews were -- that Jews were being roun -- taken to [indecipherable] and other places? A: Rounding up, taken to camps. Th-they used to come, people from Poland used to come, and -- and I -- you run away from Poland. Used to tell us stories. We -- w-we -- we -- we didn™t -- we couldn™t believe what -- what they told us, and we didn™t want to believe it. They came to the synagogue and told us what™s going on. But you know, we 14say when -- when you have a full stomach, you don™t believe the guy who™s got a -- an empty stomach. I don™t -- we have a saying lik e that. So we didn™t believe any of that, those things Q: Nobody did? A: No, we didn™t believe it. We couldn™t believe it. Q: And then when did yo u start to believe it? A: We didn™t believe it, we didn™t believe it till the -- even -- even when they took us to the camps, in the train, we didn™t know wh ere we were going. They just told us we were going to be resettled to a new settlement. We could have saved ourselves, easy. Q: What would you have d one? What could you have -- A: We could have gone -- my father, we could have gone up in the mountains. We were in the Carpathians . And we were taken away in I think was May, or -- or maybe April. We are taken away, a -- Q: What year? A: What year, 1944. And the Russians were already there in October, so if we would have stayed -- hide ourselves for six mont hs we could have survived, but we didn™t know where we were going. Q: Let™s go back and talk about how you got -- there was a ghetto -- A: Yes. Q: -- created there. A: Yes, yes. 15Q: And you were instructed to go there? A: Yes, yes. Q: Is that what happened? How did that hap -- take place? Your father was home -- A: Hap -- well, they -- they ca -- ca -- my pa -- father was home, and over there when there was -- when they want to announce something, the guy used to go like in the -- on the -- in the -- in the 18th century, or the 17th century, the guy with a -- how do you call it, with a drum, you know? Q: In town? A: In town, like a crier. Used to say, okay, all the Jews will have to gather at a certain part, you know, certain area. You couldn™t go -- you know, you couldn™t go out of your area. So we had to move from our -- from our house, and we went into my -- my aunt™s place. Q: So when you -- when you heard this -- A: Into ghetto, that means we were go -- we were going into the ghetto. Q: Right. Did you pack -- bring a lot of things? Did you know? A: Well, we packed wh-whatever we could, you know, just clothing. We didn™t have -- we didn™t have much, you know ? So we just packed whatever we had, and we went to my aunt™s place, and we stayed on the -- on -- on the l-lo -- loft? Yeah, because there was no room. Q: She lived in town? A: She lived -- yeah, she lived -- 16Q: In that area? A: In that area, not too far, maybe quarter of a mile from my hou -- from my house. Q: And what about -- you just did -- were yo ur parents alarmed? Did they think that -- A: No, we -- we took -- we took whatever the -- we took it, whatever they told us, we done. We di -- Q: You left your animals behind, and -- A: Yes, yes, we left animals, we -- we gave it to some people, you know, we had the ha -- ha -- everything, we left everything. The horses, the cows, th-the houses, the stable, th -- like I would wa lk out from this house just w ith my clothes. We left everything there, because we didn™t know where we were going.

Did -- A: N-No, they were tough, tough people, very tough. We didn™t ask no questions, just go, that™s it. Q: Did somebody come to yo ur house to bring you out? A: No, no, no, no, they tol -- we obeyed everything, because we were -- we were -- we weren™t -- we were inferior, we were so -- after there came -- th-the Jewish laws came into -- to be, and we were so -- so downtrodden that we didn™t ask no questions. Whatever they say, you just obey them. 17Q: How -- what other -- what other laws, what other regulations were enforced before you were -- left your home? A: There was not -- no -- n -- well, th-there was little anti-Semites, like we used to light candles Friday night, you know, an d some students came by, you know, who went to school, and throw stones in there, and you know, broke that, and my mother se -- my father was a very physical man, and he -- and my -- my mother says, ﬁDon™t you go there de -- leave them alone.ﬂ He was go -- he was going to beat them up. Oh yeah, we -- we -- we were downtrodden and we were -- how do you call it? We just -- Q: You felt intimidated. A: We were intimidated, we resigned ourself to the conditions. Q: And were there other Jewish families that left, do you know? A: Well, after it™s -- you know, where we us ed to live, was another town across the river called Seegirt, that was in Romania , but when Hungary came, they annexed the whole area th -- like -- like what are those called, Transylvania. So we went -- we used to li -- we use to go to the other town most of the time because we were closer to the -- to that town, Seegirt. Q: And -- and -- A: So w-we -- we didn™t -- we didn™t ask too many questions. Bec -- I wa -- I was young, we were busy scraping out, you know, food and stric -- scraping out a living. Q: Right. So you were then -- this was 1944 -- A: ™44, yeah, tha -- tha -- 18Q: -- you think, when you went into the ghetto -- A: Ghetto, in ™44, yeah.

A: No, no-nothing, nothing, it™s just pro -- you know, th -- you can only -- Jews couldn™t go further out, because if you go out of that area, they beat you up. Q: And there were guards, you we -- around the perimeter. A: Yeah, we didn™t -- we didn™t even dare going out. We just resigned ourself, we resigned our lot. Just a -- Q: And how did you live there, how did you have enough food? A: This -- this is a question I can -- I -- honest, I can™t remember how we survived. We were on -- on the loft, you kn ow. We -- we did -- we slept on -- on boards, you know, whether -- there was no -- and we -- we were there not very long. I think we were there for maybe -- maybe a fe -- maybe a month, n-not even a month, maybe two months, I can™t remember. 19Q: This was all seven of your family? A: Yes. Q: Everybody? A: Yes, yes. Q: Mother, father, five kids. A: And then my aunt had a -- excuse me -- she had daughters too, they were in that house. We were a lot of people in that house. Q: Did you go out of the house, ever? A: We all -- we -- yeah, we went out, but we couldn™t go out of that area. Q: Right, right. Did you go to school? A: No. Q: No. A: No, no, school was finished a long time ago. Q: Yeah.

Q: An -- and -- and what happened next? A: Then there was an order that all the Jews will have to go to that -- I said we had a little airport over there. So they round us up, and they say we™re -- all the Jews have to 20go into that airport. They had a -- like a hangar, you know, where they fix the planes, all the Jews went in there. Q: How many people do you think it was? A: Oh, there was th -- the whole town. And I se -- Q: More than a thousand people? A: Oh yeah. Q: 500 families? A: Yes, yes, yes. And I remember, then we knew was something wrong. When the rabbi came in there, you know the rabbi that th ey had the -- then they -- they grab the -- he had a beard, you know, like do you see the people here with -- with payas and beard? They grabbed them and pulled it out, you know, with the skin, and they -- they -- and then we knew we were in for -- were in for something. Then we were -- then we were already trapped. If we knew what -- what was going to happen, even at the airport, I don™t think we would -- my father would have grabbed us and said come on, let™s go up in the mountains. But we didn™t know, and then was too late already. Q: Yeah. Let™s break here. A: Yes. Q: Cause we have to change the tape. A: Okay. Q: Okay.

Q: And did some -- A: Was a big field. 24Q: -- did somebody come and talk to you, and address the group and tell you what was going to happen? A: No, no, there was -- there was -- how do you call it, there -- there were the Hungarian gendarmes , we called the Tolosh . They used to wear how do you call, feathers, you know? We call gendarme. They were our guards. Q: With guns? A: Of course, yeah. Q: Yeah. A: Guns, yeah, that™s right. Q: And were they -- were they interacting with people? Were they -- A: Oh yes, ye -- oh yes, yes.

Q: Pushing them around? A: Push them around, but we were frighten ed, we were frightened, we were just like you take animals into a slaughterhouse. Y ou ever -- you ever seen a slaughterhouse? Q: No. A: Where animals go in there? When they go, they -- they -- they -- they -- they -- they™re jittery, they™re frightened. We were like that. We didn™t know what was going on. We didn™t know where we were going, we didn™t know anything. 25Q: And how long were you there, what happened? A: We were there, I think, just maybe overnight. Q: Slept on the floor? A: Slept on the floor, and then they marched us in the -- the railroad was right next to it, not too far, and they put us into the -- into our train, into wagon, like a cattle cars. Put us all into cattle cars. Q: And did they tell you anything? A: Nothing. They just say, with all the luggage, whatever you have, put in there, and they put some guards on the -- on the -- on the train. Q: You took the luggage on the train? A: Oh yes. Q: Yeah. A: Every -- well, whatever you -- you -- you can take with you. Q: Do you remember what you had? A: I don™t -- a bunch of rags, that™s all it was. Q: Suitcases, maybe? A: Yeah, all your belongings, whatever you had. Q: And how old was the youngest child in your family at this point? A: I would say Shemshin was about -- he must have been in his -- seven or eight years old. Yeah. Q: And you were? 26A: ™44 I was 14. Q: So what happened next? A: Next we were in the train and we were in -- they took us, and we were rolling along, and then the people got hungry, and they got thirsty, and the children started crying and screaming. And then my -- my father was -- got very nervous and he grabbed one of the guards, you know? Q: There was a guard on the car? A: Guard on -- on -- on the train. And he -- he was -- I remember he grabbed him by his neck and he was going to, you know, do him in. And then, one of the guys over there says, ﬁHirsch, don™t be a fool. They™re going to kill you.ﬂ So, because it was like bedlam over there, you know, you know th ere was no food, no -- no -- it was in -- the air wasn™t too much, there was little -- little -- like a little, you know, the -- no -- not much air coming into the tr ains, you know, those cattle cars. And we were there for about three -- three days. Q: The car was moving the whole time? A: Moving, yeah. Q: And could you see out, did you know where you were? A: No. No, no, because was -- was -- you know what a cattle car looks like -- Q: Yeah. A: -- just a little window there, you know, with little bars. You couldn™t get air in there. And this I still remember then, I think, two days we were two days maybe on the 27train, and then at night time, then the train stopped. And then some people came in, then they opened the door, and people came in to the train, and they were those guards, you know, those -- they call haftlinger, and they -- they were like Jews from Poland who worked in the camps. That was already in Birkenau, you know, with the striped clothing. And this I still remember, he says, ﬁTell them that you™re 18 years old.ﬂ You know, for -- for the children. Tell them you™re 18 years old. And we didn™t know what it meant. Q: This guard told you that? A: This guard. No, he wasn™t a guard, no he -- Q: He was a Jew. A: -- he was a Jew that he emptied all the -- the luggage when th ey took us out from the train, you c -- you didn™t take anything with you. So you left -- you had to leave everything on the train. Q: And -- and where was it that the train stopped? A: That was in Birkenau. Q: Birkenau. A: Birkenau. Q: And the doors opened, and -- A: The doors opened. Q: What could you see? A: That was at night time. 28Q: Oh, yeah. A: Just -- it was a night, was dark. We didn™t see anything. And then they say raus , everybody raus. So we started to walk, and then they lined us up to there. Women and children one side -- women, children and old me -- old people on one side, and younger people on another side. So we came to the selection. The guy say, reckt, the guy say l -- left. Q: They told you which side to go. A: Which side to go, right. And then I knew right away, the guy said, in German he said, vial disto . How old are you? Said -- so I remember the guy, what he told us. 18 years old. Oxen yada. Same thing with my brother. He was about three years younger, he said 18. So -- s -- am -- so my brother and I and my father went to the different line, and my mother with the children went on the different. Different selection. Then already, when we walked -- then these -- they walked us to different places, and then we knew already that we were -- we were in hell. Because there were fire burning, and I can smell -- you know, I smelled the smoke, and -- and I just -- I™m talking for myself, I was in -- in a daze.

And they -- they say everybody™s undressing, and then we left the clothes there, they took the clothes away. And then they brought us those haftling clothes, you know, those 31striped clothes, you have seen the -- the -- the concentration camps. So then we knew we were -- we were saved, you know, that we were going to go to working camps. And then, after that, they took us into a big block, a big, you know, a big, you know, a block, you know, like barracks, big barrack s. And they asked people who™s got a trade? Who learned a trade? And I remember pi -- I wa -- when I was a young boy my father took me to a place to learn how to be a carpenter. He grabbed me, he says, ﬁYou go up, tell them you are a tischler.ﬂ Tischler means a -- a carpenter. And then I -- I got separated from my -- from my -- from my father, and they took me a different transport. Q: Was this all in the same night all of this happened? A: No, no, I think we were there maybe -- maybe one -- I was there maybe two days, two days or three days I stayed there. A nd then they shipped me out to a different camp.

See, I got -- I -- I never got a -- I never got a how do you call it, a -- Q: Tattoo? A: -- tattoo, because I didn™t stay long enough in there. I stayed only about two days. But my father stayed in Birkenau for quite awhile, and then he went to a different camps called the Bunau, like a working camp. And they made all kinds of ammunition over there, and they were build there -- you know, building all kinds of buildings. Remember I told you about the s -- that cousin who learned how to lay bricks? They had a school there, they teach them how to lay bricks. And he was there for about maybe eight months. Q: Your father? A: My father. But I didn™t know where he was, my father -- 33Q: Oh. A: -- because they took me away right away to a different -- different camps. We were about maybe, quite a ways from there, maybe two days by train. Q: So you got on another train? A: Got on -- on a train, and they put me in -- in fi -- we were 500 people on that train. Q: For o -- a couple of days, you said? A: No, no b -- I was there fo r -- for about maybe -- maybe a cou -- maybe a week, and then they took us to another camp. They selected 500 people from that bigger camp, and then they sep -- shipped us to another camp, 500. Q: Do you know the name of the next camp? A: It was called Allenbush. And then they were build -- we were building a little station, like a railroad station. Q: And -- and staying in barracks? A: In barracks, yeah, we were about 20 -- 20 of us in -- in a -- in a barrack. Q: And was it a big camp? Was it a -- A: About 500 people. Q: 500. A: Yes. And we were -- Q: And barbed wire around it? A: Pardon? Q: Barbed wire around the perimeter, just like -- 34A: Oh yes, yes, yes. A little -- like a little -- like they have in the camps over here, like a little hut, you know? Little -- we were about 20 of us, and we used to go out to work every day, and then come in. And they fee -- fed us. Q: What did you have for food? A: In the morning I remember we got up about five o™clock in the morning, was called appelle. They lined us up, and then count -- count -- count everybody. And then after that they gave us, how do you call, they gave us coffee. Just black coffee. Just coffee itself. We -- then, after that, we went to work. And we were there till about one o™clock in the afternoon because the work wasn™t too far from the -- from the working -- the camp wasn™t too far from the working place. And we came back, and they gave us a soup, like a ver -- very light soup. We were there for about an hour, then came back to work again. And seven o™clock we came b ack. We finished our work. And that™s how -- I was there for about -- around December in that camp. Q: Until December. A: Till December, yes. Q: So you™ve been away from home already now, seven, eight months? A: Eight months, yeah, yeah, yeah -- Q: You left in April, May? A: -- yeah -- yeah -- yeah -- yeah. Q: So it™s winter now? A: Yes, yes, it was. So -- yeah. 35Q: And how was your health? A: My he -- wel -- we -- well, was good, it was good. I mean, I felt -- felt good, I wasn™t sick. Fada -- but I -- Q: Were other people sick? A: Oh yes. Q: Were other people getting sick? A: Yes, yes. I didn™t f -- I didn™t feel sick as long as I was working, I felt good, but I -- I -- I never s -- I™ve never seen myself, I never looked in mirror, because there was no mirrors in there, you know, you didn™t know what you look like, you know? Q: And were -- were the guards mistreating people, were they cruel, were -- was there a [indecipherable] A: Well, the-the -- they had guards, yes, oh yes, yes. The one I remember once one g -- these t -- they were the Ukrainian SS. They -- they were -- they used to come in there -- I -- I used to unload gravel. You know, we us ed to build a -- we used to unload ga -- gravel, used to came in in the wagon, used to beat us up for just -- you just keep on going. I never -- I never was sick. On all the time, I was never sick. Because if you™re sick, that™s it, you™re finish. Q: And were -- were there other people who -- who were killed, or died while they were doing this work? A: Well, we didn™t know if -- if they were sick, or anything, they just took them off. You don™t know w-what happens to them, yeah. Everybody was for himself. I 36remember one day -- I used to work on the night shift, and I™ ve seen some guys used to go down near the camp. They had potatoes, you know for the -- used to -- they have potatoes underground, you know, that it shouldn™t get rotten. Q: In a cellar. A: Yeah. No, o-on the open fields. So they went and started, you know, stealing potatoes. So I figure, hey, if these guys can do it, maybe I™ll try it myself, go with these guys because they -- they put it in their -- their shirts. So one day I went with these guys, and I went underneath the ground, and th-th -- the ground caved in -- in on me. And I got so frightened, and I didn™t know how to get out there. I finally got out. And they caught couple of guys, and they got such a beating, I says, no, no more. I™d rather die than to -- to go through that. So I never -- never tried again. Q: You said it was every man for himself. A: Everybody™s for himself, yeah. Q: There was no cooperation -- A: Oh, b -- Q: -- between the people, of any ki nd, to help each other, or -- A: Well, they di -- they -- there was not hing, because you didn™ t get -- you didn™t get enough food. You couldn™t help anybody be cause you couldn™t share with anybody any food, because if you get so little food -- we used to get -- you know how we used to divide our bread? We got those German br eads, those square breads. So four of us, for four people divided, they get a bread for a day, you know? So we used to cut it in 37four, and we didn™t know ho w to -- who™s going to get -- maybe some guys are going to get a bigger piece, or some guys got a smaller piece. Used to cut up the bread, and put it under the blanket. So they say, ﬁ Mark, which one do you want?ﬂ I pointed on -- on the blanket, I says, ﬁI want this one.ﬂ So that™s how we used to -- it was -- that™s how we used to live. And I -- Q: Did you -- did you have anybody that you talked to, any -- anybody that was like a friend to you, friendly to you? A: Yeah, we used to talk, but we -- we weren™t -- that™s all, we used to talk we™re -- we™ll ever be free, that™s all there was, you know? There™s nothing to talk about, nothing, you know. We didn™t even know what happened to our parents, or [indecipherable] we -- we only see -- we only see in there -- there -- what was going on there, but after that we [indecipherable]. Everybody was for himself. Q: Did you hear any rumors about what was happening in other places? You didn™t know anything -- A: No, no. Q: -- about the war, about how the progress of the war? A: No. The only thing I re member is we were in Obershlazier , and there was a big town cal -- a big city called Breslau, and we can hear already the -- they were bombing. They were bombing, the Russians were coming. And I can see on the street, you know the, when th e Germans -- that was East Germany then, the -- the Germans were evacuating, you know, they took their cattles with the cows, with the -- with the 38horses.

Q: And you probably didn™t have a nything but your thin uniform. A: Yeah, th-that™s a -- you know what we used to do? We used to -- I used to -- we used to carry cement bags, you know, we were work with cement. We took the cement 39bags and cut out, you know, for the neck, you know, we put -- used to, with paper, you know, that™s how we used to keep warm. Q: Cement bags, yeah, they came -- they™re like heavy. A: Heavy, and we put th-the -- the jacket over it. Q: Heavy paper. A: Yes, yes. Q: For insulation. A: Insulation, that™s it. And then -- then when -- Q: What about your feet? A: My f -- ma -- Q: What did you have on your -- A: -- my feet, we had th-those shoes, you know, those like wooden -- how do you call it, with the wooden -- wooden soles. Q: Mm-hm.

Q: So they -- they came to get you and march you out? A: March. Q: What was happening around that time, do you -- A: Oh tha-that was -- that was the worst tim e like -- wi -- that I can remember. You™re starting to march, day and night. No, just in the daytime. At night time they used to put us up in a -- like in a barn, or you know, in a place where they can put us up, you know? Q: Wherever you were. A: Whatever -- y-yeah. And we didn™t have no food, not too much. And then, after we were finished, you know, get up, you know, they light up that barn, me -- because a lot of people were hiding there, you know, they didn™t want to carry on. They didn™t want to march any more. So then they screamed out, ﬁWhoever ca -- whoever can™t walk, we going to take you on a wagon.ﬂ So there were wagons right behind us, and people who couldn™t walk, they put them on a wagon, and they took them into the bushes and shot them. So I never volunteered to -- to -- I always stayed in front of -- of the -- of the pack. Q: Let™s take a break now. A: Okay. 41Q: And we™ll change the tape.

Q: Do you know the name of that one? A: The bigger camp was Flossenburg . That was a big camp already. Q: Mm. And what -- what happened there? A: Flossenburg was a camp that they got all these small camps -- they gathered all, and then small camps, and from there they evaluate the people who were strong 44enough. They shipped them out to work, and the ones who couldn™t, they weren™t valuable enough to work, they stayed on th -- in Flossenburg. Q: So you were separated out again? A: Separated again. I was there about maybe a month, or maybe two months. Q: And you were working, cause you were [indecipherable] A: No, Flossenburg we didn™t work. Then when they shipped us out, then we started to work again. Q: What did you do in the camp during the day? A: Did nothing. You just tried to -- to su rvive. I remember we used to, in the wintertime we -- we would try to keep ourself warm, so we us ed to -- we gathered a lot of people, we™re pushing agains t each other, you know, in th -- in the camps.

A: Well -- Q: Did you get a number on your forehead? A: Yeah, I got a -- yeah. So we -- they shipped me out to -- to work. They put us on a train, and they -- we were working.

They didn™t know who it was on those trains. It wasn™t cattle cars, it was, you know, proper trains. And I remember they shot my friend. I was sitting next to my friend, like on the seat, and I notice here™s some -- some red. I thought it was marmalade or something. Then I™ve seen he was shot. Because you couldn™t run out, you know, you couldn™t run -- if you run out from that train, the guard would shoot you, would kill you right away, so y -- so you had to stay on the train. Q: And was he sitting by the window? A: He was sitting yeah, near the windows, yeah. Q: Hm. A: Yeah. And th -- and then that was already close to the -- to the liberation, so then they took us -- they stopped, and they t ook us into -- into the mountains.

And there was a lot of prisoner, Russian prisoners who were -- came home from the -- from the Germany. And I said to sar -- to my sister, I says -- and then I even slept with her in the same bed because I was afraid some of these Russian prisoners were going to, you know, rape her or do something. So -- so j -- shshe was there for one week. I said, ﬁSara , you better go back. Go back to -- go back to Budapest,ﬂ because I had some cousins there. ﬁYou go back there, and I don™t want you stay here no more. And I™m going to hang around here, wait. Maybe my father or my brother, somebody will come home.ﬂ And I stayed there for another six months. Q: Did she tell you stories about what -- what had happened to her? 56A: No, not much. W-w-w-we knew wh -- we knew what was going on, we -- we knew. We knew. Nobody -- we knew right away when we -- when we were in Birkenau, we -- we already seen our -- our -- our lot. Was nothing to ask any more. And a wa -- and then I came -- then I stayed there and my cousin and I, we said, no more. We™re not going to stay here no more. We™re going to go back, go west.

We didn™t know what wa -- was going to be, was it going to be Russia, is going to be Hungary, we didn™t know. So then the Russians clamped down and they closed the borders. And you co uldn™t move any more from my hometown, come to -- to Sighet, you couldn™t go there no more. I used to walk across the river, you know, but if they -- if th ey catch you, they -- they put you in jail or they could s -- they cou -- they could shoot you. So say it™s time to --to move on. And from there I went to -- it™s a long story -- and from there we went to Budapest. In Budapest I joined up an organization, a Jewi sh organization like a -- it™s called Mizrachi , like -- you ever heard that? Q: Mm-hm. A: Yeah, I joined them and we -- we -- I don™t know how many people were there, maybe -- maybe 50 people, maybe less. And we were going to go to Israel.

A: My -- in a -- yi -- no, no, no, my sister wasn™t there, my sister was -- she went to Czechoslovakia , and stayed with my -- with cousins. And then I heard that she went back to Germany.

And then from Belgrade we were going to go to Israel, but through Greece. It™s called Saloniki, a town, Saloniki . And then we got on a train to go to Saloniki . And then at the border the Yugoslav guards stopped us. They -- they -- they -- they -- how to call, the grainits, how do you call the -- the -- the border guards stopped us, they won™t let us into Yugoslavia -- to -- into Greece, to Saloniki . So we stayed at the border overnight, and they called us -- called up in Belgrade the headquarters, what are they going to do with us, we were on no man™s land. What are we going to do? Greeks won™t let us in, and Yugoslavia won™t let us in, we are on no man™s land. So finally the gr -- the Yugoslavians said okay, bring them back. So we came back to -- we came back to Belgrade and we stayed there for about, oh I don™t know, maybe a couple -- a couple of weeks. And from there we went to Italy. Q: Was this just you and your cousin, or -- 59A: Yeah, yeah -- Q: -- a larger group? A: No, wa -- wa -- wa -- wa -- wa -- with a -- with a group.

And I was making a little money, and he paid me a little money, not much, but I didn™t have to pay for -- for food, no room and board. The only thing I had to go as -- if I want to go dancing, or I want to go just for the subway, and the buses, that™s all. I didn™t need much money over there. Q: And did you go out on the weekends?

So then th ere was a transport -- the Jewish Congress 72made up a transport of boys under 18. They could go to Canada. So I joined -- I joined that group, and from there I went to London .

I went -- I remember I went to a hospital called the chil -- the -- the Rothschild Hospital. I was there for a week and the doctor wouldn™t pass me. And then, after I went to the hospital, they straighten me out an d then I -- then I came, I was very frustrated for -- for about a month, because I couldn™t come, because my cousin left.

Then my sister heard that I was in Canada , so -- so she started making papers, and she came. Q: Sara. A: Fola -- followed me, right. Q: So -- A: And then I stayed in Montreal for about six months, and I heard my cousin settled down in Toronto , so I came to Toronto. That was in 1948. Q: And your sister came then? A: My sister came maybe a few years later. And we -- the Jewish Congress settled us in with families. Like, we stayed with a family. Still remember the name Schecter. I s -- I slept with a little boy, you kn ow, with wa -- in one room in Toronto , and then I went to work. Went to work as a jeweler. Q: Uh-huh. 75A: I was making already 12 bucks -- 12 dollars a week. And we were paying 15 dollars a week for -- they charge for the -- you know, room and board.

Q: And -- and when you hear that tape, what -- what do you hear in your own voice, what -- what can you -- A: Just -- just the question that he answered -- but I wasn™t sure it was me, but -- but I recognized myself, it was me. It was no fake. Q: In that tape to me, you sounded a little tired, and a little -- A: Tired, well -- Q: -- kind of -- A: -- you know what it was, it wasn™t tired. Insecured. Very insecured, you know? You don™t -- you™re alone, you™re -- you don™t know what™s going to be. Feel very, very, you know, taken away, you know, from a fa mily, you know? Insecurity, it wasn™t tired, I wasn™t tired one bit.

Because we done a lot of things that -- like I put myself, when they ask me what -- what are you -- where are you from? So I told them I was Romanian. We were so insecured because my cousin is romani -- was born in Romania, so I felt maybe if - 78- if I tell him I was Hungarian or Czechoslovakian, they going to separate us, you know? It™s insecured, insecured, very insecured. Q: If you don™t -- if you don™t remember that interview, there™s not a lot I can ask you about, but -- A: No, you -- you can ask me. Ask me, ask me. Q: This professor, his voice was -- when I heard the tape, his voice was so, sort of aggressive. A: Yes, yes. No, well, w -- you see -- w -- you know what is aggressive? When you speak German.

Q: See what they remember of what they told him -- A: I see, I see. 80Q: -- versus what they remember now. A: But I remember the -- I remember the school, the ORT school. I remember the name of the wi -- of the street. Q: What street? A: Clamark . That™s the name of the street. I remember it was up on a hill, you know, like -- I remember when the -- the -- every morning, what the guys were washing the -- the streets, you know, thos e cobblestone street. I still remember those things. I remember it -- there was a lot of people from Spain, who -- who work with -- against Franco. They -- they were learning how to be electricians too. And I still remember that I went back to a place, they send me back -- that what turned me off from the elec -- from being electrician. He send me to a place where to work, and we have to work putting holes in the wall, like you know, thos e stone walls. And there was no electric drills those days, and you had to use a chisel, you know? You -- you hammer it and then twist it to make a hole. And I was there doing the -- and in a half a day I make maybe three holes, you know? It -- it was kind of boring, you know? So I said no, no. Q: Let™s take a break here. A: Yes. Q: Change ta -- End of Tape Four 81Beginning Tape Five Q: Okay, I want to ask you some more questions about being in Paris. A: Yes. Paris seems interesting for you. Q: Well, it™s a time when you™re -- A: You -- you™re fascinated with Paris. Q: -- it™s not so much Paris, it™s sort of you -- A: Paris was -- Q: -- coming out of this one experience -- A: -- yeah, yeah, and coming into something else. Q: -- and going into another one. A: Oh yeah, a different world. Q: So you™re in a transition here. A: That™s right, very mu -- Q: And you™re young. A: That™s right. Q: You™re only 18. A: That™s right. Q: So you have your -- this -- A: Oh, we ha -- it was -- it was -- the only problem over there, we didn™t have money. Because -- said we had to change clothing, and all that. Because y-y-you couldn™t 82make any money, only if you™re -- if you™re -- you know, a tradesman, a good tradesman, but -- Q: When you were -- when you were in Paris, a lot of the people that you were with were also refugees, but were people in general understanding of what had happened to you? At this point did people know what had happened in -- A: We -- we were all in the same boat. Q: No, but I mean Parisian™s. A: Oh, Parisian™s. Oh yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, we -- oh -- oh yeah, oh yeah -- Q: Did you -- did -- did peopl e knew that it happened? A: -- because the French, they suffered too, you know, the French Jews. They -- they suffered a lot too. Oh yeah, France was in the -- they were in the same boat as we were. You know, they were taken to the -- to the camps, they suffered a lot, a lot of them survived. Same thing with the -- a lot of Europeans, Jews like the -- the Greeks, the -- the Hungarians, the French, even the Italians, they suffered a lot, too. The only differences between them and us, that they could disguise themselves, you know, beca -- Q: Who -- who? A: Like th-the French, you know, because they spoke French, these pu -- and the -- and you know, and they -- and they mingled in with -- with the -- with the people, you know? They couldn™t tell who was a Jew, and who wasn™t a Jew, you know? But with us it was very easy because we were very easily disguised, easily recognized. 83Q: How? Explain that. A: Because -- because we all lived -- we all lived in a ghetto. Like in Europe all the Jews, they gather together, the same over here like they live in whatever, Beverly Hills, or wherever lives the -- lot of them live, you know, together. But the French -- an-and -- and the -- they™re weren™t that many French, you know, because they can get lost amongst millions of people. But with us, like in a hometown like mine, you know, you couldn™t hide. Even Budapest was very hard to hide yourself. Q: Yeah. When you came to Paris and you started to have a little bit of a routine -- A: Yes. Q: -- and a little bit of a life, did you go to synagogue? A: Funny, no, no. Didn™t go to synagogue, no. Tha-that was an -- I was completely -- not that I deny that my -- my -- when I came to Canada , then I started, you know, getting back, you know. But otherwise, didn ™t want to believe anything, we didn™t have no interest. No intere st in religion at all. Q: What about in the camps? A: In the camps, y -- well, over there, no, no. The only thing we done is we fasted. I-It was only one -- or it was only one day out of a year, and there was -- we were there only one year. No, we didn™t have no -- no inte rest in religion because we lost it all. I remember when we came in Auschwitz, you know, and they were undressing us, and all the people started to scream, where is God, where is God, you know? You know, so we -- we sort -- a lot of people lost it. That™s it. How can you do this to us? That™s how 84e -- we felt. Yeah, I was -- it wasn™t -- it was -- when I came to France I was already no -- life was getting into normal. But I wasn™t old enough then, you know? I wasn™t old enough, only -- was only to go out there and have fun, and that™s it. But otherwise, never thought of religion, anything like that. Q: You told me about -- you showed me a photograph which we will show later, of you and some cousins, and your sister -- A: Yes. Q: -- in Paris. A: Yes. Q: What was -- what happened there? How did everybody happen to be in the same place? A: Because we lived in the same -- same place, same hotel. We all lived in the same hotel. We all gathered. I still remember, the reason we done it too, because we were -- we were parting. You know , like one cousin went to Ecuador , and another one -- another person went to how do ca -- to Venezuela, Caracas. We were -- we were leaving Paris. We didn™t want to stay there, we just want to get out of Europe. Wanted to start a new life. Q: And it™s interesting to me that you were all going different places. A: No, it™s not we were going different places. We were going wherever we could go, whatever was open for us. But the main thing, we all wanted to come to America , but America was -- we couldn™t come to America. I don™t know, maybe we weren™t smart 85enough, we didn™t know the right -- the right channels. But I know one thing, I always wanted to come to America. Even all these years I want to come to America, I couldn™t come. So finally I said to my wife, I don™t know whether it was in 1965, says, ﬁWe™re going to go to America.ﬂ I was lucky because I couldn™t come on my papers, I could go on -- on her papers, because she was En glish. So I go on her quota. My quota would never be able to come to America. I tried a couple of times coming across the border, Niagara Falls . Go back, you don™t have no papers. Q: In your interview with Professor Boder, you told him that yo u had an uncle in America. A: Yes. Q: Did you ever -- but you didn™t know where he was. A: I didn™t know where he was, but I finally found -- found out where he was, I got in touch with my aunt. Remember I told you my aunt send me the 10 dollars? She said what I have to do is just ask the Jewish Cong ress, so -- but I don™t know what city he is in, I don™t know -- I only know his name. His name was Sam Moskovitz . So the Jewish Congress found him for me, that he live -- he came out and -- in 1902. So what your -- he was c-came out to America before my -- my father was born. Q: So he was a lot older than your father? A: Oh yeah -- pardon? Q: Older than your father, a lot older. A: Yeah, my father was born in 1903. 86Q: Oh. A: Yeah, he was -- Q: So he™s been here the whole time. A: Yeah, he was here. He was a nice guy, but he didn™t -- he didn™t know us. The only person that knew us is my aunt from Cleveland, Aunt Lana. And all the cousins, everybody jumped on Aunt Lana to send us money or do something for us, that she couldn™t take us all out. She took a -- the ot her cousins, but I didn™t get a chance. So I had to go to Canada , second best. Q: Did you ever get to meet her? A: Who Lana? Oh yes. Oh, after I came out to Toronto , I had a house. She came to my house, we slept in my house. We put the mattresses on the floor and we all slept there. Toronto. She -- she was one of -- she came out -- she remembers all of us. I wasn™t born then, but she came and must have been in the -- after the -- I think after the second World War -- the first World War. She must have come out here in 19 -- in the 20™s. Q: And those other cousins that you were with in Paris, one went to Venezuela -- A: Yeah. Yes. Q: -- one -- what happened -- A: But he wasn™t a cousin, he was a -- an acquaintance, you know, a friend. Q: Oh. A: But the one from ke -- Quito, he is a cousin of mine, yeah. And -- 87Q: Did you ever see him again? A: No, no, I never see him. Yeah, I missed him, I missed him. He -- he invited me over for a Bar Mitzvah , to Ecuador, but I couldn™t make it. So he passed -- he passed on, yeah. Yeah, we were all spread out. Oh yeah, but m-ma -- it was interesting story about my brother. Q: What -- what happened? A: You know, I didn™t know I had a brother -- Q: That™s right. A: -- till somebody came from my hometown, and told me, ﬁMark, you know, you have a brother at home.ﬂ So I wrote a lette r, and there he send me that picture, that picture, you know, with the Russian -- Russian soldier. Q: And -- and where was this that you fou nd -- where were you when you found out? A: In Paris. Q: And where had he been when you went there? A: He -- he was in Russia all that time. But that was 19 what -- ™46. We were still new there, you know? And found out that he is in -- that he was in my hometown, and he didn™t know about us. Q: What had happened to him from -- from Auschwitz? A: Auschwit -- he got liberated. He got liberated in a place called Glivitz. That™s -- he got liberated in January. And then the Russians took him to Russia. He was a young boy, he was what, about 12 years at that time. 88Q: He had been with your father? A: Ma -- my father, yes. And my father died, somebody -- they killed my father. He told me. Q: After the -- b-bef -- A: You know, around -- must have be en around January, around January. Q: On a march? A: No, they didn™t march, because they didn™t march far enough. He was in a place called Bunau. And Bunau from Glivitz is -- excuse me -- it™s not that far. So he got liberated by the Russians. Q: Your brother. A: My brother, sure. Q: And -- and when was your father killed? A: My father must have been killed around -- in I would say January or February, something like that. Q: Around the same time? A: Same -- yeah, when -- when the -- they liquidated Auschwitz, cause the Russians were coming. And they emptied all th e, you know -- and then he went to Glivitz, and then he -- they took him to Russia. He was there all that time. Q: Mm-hm. And is it your assumption that your mother was killed right away? 89A: Oh, my mother, the -- they all went to the -- they all went to the gas chamber. All -- all the -- the whole town. Everybody, ex -- a-anybody who wasn™t able to work, put into a work camp, they -- they -- they eliminated them. Q: First day. A: Pardon? Q: First day. A: The first day, yeah. I -- I could see them coming, or -- stepping out from the train, coming, I can see it. We were standing ther e outside and my -- my friend said from my hometown, ﬁHey Mark , look, there™s your mother, there™s your -- your sister,ﬂ blah, blah, blah. They we -- marching into the -- how do you call it? They marching -- they -- they took them off from the train, and they took them right away. Maybe I don™t know how long they were there, kept there, but they were all taken out the gas chambers. Q: That was your mother, and whic h of your siblings, youngest ones? A: Well, my -- one of them was Malka, Marilyn. Q: Two -- two of them, right. A: Two of them, yeah, yeah, and that™s -- Q: Malka and -- A: -- Malka and Shemshin -- s -- it™s Sam, or --yeah. Q: The baby. A: The baby, yeah. 90Q: Yeah, yeah. A: And my mother. Because she wasn™t old enough to -- she was -- went with the children. And the -- the guys who are in Cleveland now, their mother was a young woman, beautiful, strong woman, Malka, but she -- she had small children. So anybody with small children, ev en if they were able to wo rk, as long as you want to go with your children, you want to -- they eliminate -- they take you to the gas chamber. It™s a harsh thing to say, isn™t it? You can™t just say it so cold blooded, you know, but that™s -- that™s what happened. Anybody who -- young people, let™s see, young woman who -- who had a child. 19 - 20 year old girl s who had children, they went to the gas chamber. You™ve seen fiddl -- you™ve seen Spielberg™s -- what™s the name that film? Q: ﬁSchindler™s List.ﬂ A: Schindler -- you™ll see in that, young people, that™s what -- that™s what happened. Unless you -- you want to th row your baby away, and y ou could save yourself. Q: Yeah. A: You had a choice. Q: Have you, in the years since you came to Canada and the U.S. , do you ever meet with people that you knew -- knew in the camps? You ever run into anybody? A: No, I never -- never run into anybody bi -- in the camps, because it was a small camp. Was only about 500 people of -- and fo r us to sort of -- you know, for me to meet somebody who was in that same camp, there was no chance, because you know - 91Q: Yeah. And I have some random questio ns. When -- were you ever sorry that you didn™t go to Israel? A: I ever sorry? No. Q: You didn™t really want to go, I mean -- A: No, no, no. Q: -- it was an option, but you always -- A: No, no. It -- it wasn™t an option, it was -- it was -- it wa s sort of -- too many people were ahead of us, you know? People who had money, who could pay their way to go there, could go. But we -- we -- we couldn™t go anywhere. We could only go whatever, you know, was available for us to go. No, I wasn™t -- it™s not that I was -- I wa -- all my friends -- and -- they were in Israel -- all of them -- most of them went to Israel, because it™s the -- how do you call it, the circumstances brings you to -- to go there. Otherwise, I would have went there. Like coming to Canada, or coming to United States. It wasn™t a matter of that I didn™t want to go there, it™s just a matter of circumstances. Q: But you -- you™ve also said you had it in your mind always that you wanted to go to the United States. A: Yeah, yes. Q: Was that something that began when you got to France , or had that been -- A: No, I -- since I was a little boy, when I was at home, playing i-in the sand. You know, people were talking about the America , you work only eight hours, and they 92have electricity, and they go to movies. And -- and I was -- you know, i -- i -- you™re dreaming, you know? Like utopia. That -- that was in my -- in my mind. Q: Did you ever see a movie? A: Pardon? Q: Did you -- A: Oh yeah, I used to go ma -- I used to watch movies. Q: In your town? A: Yes, yes.
