The sky is gloomy. Terrible things are happening. I hear the Germans are talking children age 2 10 far away. Transports of children are coming to Lith, Lithuania and some are murdered and other sold for 2 or 3 marks. Your hair bristles on hearing these things. There was Western European culture come.

Krikh- sitzyokyotzo Street was full of men, bundles, little children. The men had control of themselves, they faces were frozen. No tears. And the transports arrived, one after another.

December 24 - A quiet Christmas Eve. The ground is decorated with a white cloak. The stars are smiling looking down at the decorated earth. But the green fir tree with it, its golden decorations which peeps out of every window, pains my heart the most. This is their holiday not ours. It is their Jesus who was born, and our Jesus yet to be born. They didn't established God's ten commande, ments. They don't love their broth- ers as theirselves. They murder them. You are happy with Jesus on account of the holiday, on account of your brandy, but you don't observe the commandments. You don't love your Jesus and he curses you. We also curse you. "Let you be damned, damned for ever." January 1 a thousand nine hundred forty four - In the page of history the year 43 will be designed, designed as a period of the cruelest blood letting of the Jewish people. There is so much evil!

And when they cut apart families? And the black could and the terror of the concentration camp. And the day of October 26th. Three thousands of souls ripped away from their families and brothers and sent to the land of Estonia. And the orphans. There were burned at last, last in the large bonfire!

Thousand five hundred little chil- dren and older ones were taken to the Forts. 40, 40 policemen ended their lives in the 9th Fort. The others were held a few days longer and were freed in exchanged for the information which they delivered. The younger generation up to age 12 was killed.

But there were heroic mothers, that strangled their children with their hands! The mothers ordered the Germans to kill them first and only from their corpses could the Germans take their children. Eternal honor to these mothers! And the sons? Sons. The youth handed over all that was dear to them with his own hands his elderly, crippled parents to the truck and the women waked in terror holding their babies i their arms. Awful! And what a sun shines on this same day! And she smiles down from the sky, until the laughter overcomes you. H, ha, ha...and also the sun laughs at mankind. March 28 - A bloo, bloody tragedy. There are no words to describe it. Oh, the mothers, the the wretched mothers who returned from work and didn't find their children! God does not exist. He sent the sun to laugh. God, brotherhood and ideals - all of these are finished. All capitulate under the instinct of life and death. April 4 (last entry before escape) - On the face of it, everything seems quiet. Those whom the calamity didn't not affect stay quiet, and those who had their heart wrenched out -- will the wound scab over from sorrow? Not, it will not scab over.

At home, there is nothing to eat: no flour nor potatoes. September 14 Despite the regulation against bringing something into the Ghetto, people smuggle food through the gate or over the fence. Here, I say, this is a people! The Jewish people will never obey and they will live forev- er. The Jewish nation will never be destroyed. September 24 Fall weather. Rain is fighting sunshine, the wind is spreading yellow leaves, and people are digging pota- toes. There was trouble in the ghetto today. Somebody tried to bring firewood from town and flour hidden under the wood was detected at the gate. This will not go away unnoticed. Five people have already been ar- rested. They may be executed. September 27 People are restless. Today 200 women were deported to Palemonas. October 1 A beautiful day, so warm that one could go swimming. When I came back from town, I carried 10kg in my hands. We have sold Daddy's coat so things have improved. That's why we've had great meals. But how long can it last, a week or so, and then hunger again.

We hear that the Allies have conquered Algiers and Morocco. Everybody is dis- cussing the news in the ghetto. But we have no use for it. It doesn't help. November 15 The mood in the Ghetto is gloomy. People talk of actions in Poland and fear they will happen here. Today I worked a lot. Bread that you earned by the sweat of your brow tastes good. November 19 Against my will, the hanging keeps returning before my eyes. And what is life compared with death? What's the purpose of living? To suffer, to struggle? And anyhow, death waits for you. You disappear from the world, as if you never existed. November 24 It's been a long time since I read any books. Besides that, at home it is dark in the evenings because they shut off the electricity. I lie in the darkness, assaulted by memories of the past, and there is no way I can quiet them and shake myself from them. November 30 Real winter began. The children took their sled out- side.

There is no culture. No food for the soul. There is not even a drop of enlightenment. The human machine dies quickly. the factory destroys its health. The black, murderous factory. it sucks up a young, strong, healthy person, possessed of happy dreams, drunk with life, and spits out a crippled man, who face is plowed with wrinkles and aged before its time, whose eyes are extinguished.

The Ghetto which was drowned in flames, left footprints that destroy wisdom. No house was left. In place of where they stood tall and proud, there are only darkened gloomy chimneys facing the heavens; witness that this place -- is a graveyard.
