So anti-Semitism was rampant in Lithuania uh they didn't need encouragement of Germans to act out there anger or frustration or whatever it was uh or hatred for the Jews. During the period I was--uh I can recall, I--there were no Pogroms that I was aware at least not in Kovno itself. Perhaps there may have been in some of the smaller towns. But in Kovno I don't recall any particular events of this type. SB: And the moving in to the ghetto, do you remember the things your family took or do you remember what you took?

There were four of us; my brother, my mother, my father and I and uh there wasn't a hell of a lot we could take with us. Whatever we could wrap up in a blanket or something or a sheet and carry on our backs. And so we managed to take uh--but the--the--the uh--some of the jewelry that my mother had helped save our lives a little bit because my mother use to uh sneak out from the barbed wire fence through the--at night and barter with the peas- ants for food and bring food us uh because the food rations that we got in the ghetto were very minimal.

And as we henced off and uh there was a bridge connecting the two halfs or something like that. And uh they wanted to consoli- date us in--into one area so we were all made to move. There was one building that was a hospital building. Quote unquote uh it wasn't a real hospital. It was just a hospital where pe--sick people were kept. And I remember seeing that was on fire. Uh I thinking in terms that uh some of the people that were in that hospital were not allowed to leave. So they might have been burned in the building alive. But that's my surmise. I didn't actually see that other than I saw the building burning.

Uh--uh and my brother said to him that it's an old broken watch, it doesn't work, you know, it's worthless. Uh he talked him out of shooting him and took the broken down watch and left but uh there was uh--uh quite a commotion. It was one of the first big commotions that uh in the main ghetto.

Uh, there was one area which was a main square like where the gate from the ghetto uh was uh. And people use to have to assemble there to go into work brigades. My brother, my father being one of them. They uh assembled in the morning. They were marched out and uh--uh we were standing at night--in evening rather waiting for him to come back and hoping that they would come back and in some cases they some of them did not. Uh there were assemblies for work details as far as I can remember--remember. Uh there may have been assemblies for other reasons and but uh I my family and I were not impacted by that since we all managed to get back to our apartment, at the time. There were other assemblies subsequently. Uh we use to call it the Big Action or the Big Actia where we were woken up early in the morning and marched to a big field and uh people were being selected; uh the typ--typical left and right uh kind of situation. Uh but that came later. Uh, my father and my mother and my brother and I uh we were work--worked as family unit.

Uh, fortunately for us because what my brother and my father who were young and robust people uh were redeemed to be of work--of labor quality and so the whole family unit including the two strange women, heh, that latched on to us uh managed to be selected into the side that survived. The other side were apparently taken to uh--uh what I understand is to be a Fort in where they were shot. At least that's the story that I--I recall. Uh so that was uh very trying time for us and a very dramatic experience. Uh, there was another time when we had an assembly uh were all of us were forced to gather around a big place and there was a uh a scaf- fold, a hanging scaffold and there was a man being brought out and we were forced to watched uh to the scaffold. And the reason presumably that he was going to be executed, hanged. That they uh was that they found some kind of a weapon on him. And uh I remember uh being made to watch this uh where they put him up on a box I believe with his hands and legs tied, I think. Uh and they kicked out the box from under him. A German soldier did that and he was hanging. The things you remember as a child is that uh--uh urine was coming down his leg as he was wriggling on--on--on the noose--on the rope.

JL: Well, uh I remember that uh we were as children, hanging around a little bit in the streets. Uh, I remember that uh there was a cobbler who use to make uh boots and uh the German officers to come to uh have boots custom made for them and the uh we watched that and uh it was uh an impression that made uh me, was that even in the ghetto, if you had any kind of skill or craft, uh you could survive better than anybody else. So that gave me the philosophy in life that uh what I have in my brain, and my skills and my abili- ties, nobody can take away, while all material things can be taken away.

Uh, afterwards when it was apparently all over, and my mother came to fetch me, I found out that the children rounded up throughout the ghetto and taken away and for some reason or other they did not bother to go into the workshop; perhaps thinking that there wouldn't be any children inside. But that the workshop was not at all effected by the particular Action. (Cough) SB: The commotion--the commotion that you heard... JL: Yes. SB: Can you describe that to me?

JL: We...I was mentioning, that hiding place was pre- pared ahead of time as uh when--when we got wind that there's gonna be an evacuation. The Russian army was getting close and the Germans were going to evacuate all of us out of Lithuania. So in preparation for it, dug this sub-basement uh--uh and the entrance to it was through a trap door in the building. It was hidden. And uh there was one other--a door in the uh basement, in the side of the room but it was covered on the outside by dirt so that it would not be detected as a door. And uh when things became more imminent or families uh all those that were in on that particular hiding place were uh came over--and came in there and Video Tape No.____ Camera Roll No. ____ Sound Roll No. ____ KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/JACOB LEWIN page 25 Interviewed (5-7-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films, Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd, Potomac, MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: uh we wound up uh--uh in a room full of people--fairly large number of people at that. My father, my mother and I--and my brother was not with us at the time uh I don't know where he was but he was somewhere in the ghetto roaming around on his own. Uh we were in that room for a number of days uh perhaps a week or longer. It was extremely hot uh and uh foul air. There was no toilet facilities in there. People use to have to relieve themselves went to one corner and relieve themselves there and uh cover it up I guess the with the--the dirt in the basement uh. Uh it got so hot that everybody took their clothes off, just about. And we were uh half naked in there. It was uh dark uh I guess the primary reason was because we didn't want to be detected some how by a crack of light coming out at night so the Germans could spot us. Uh and we sat there for uh days I said. Uh shouting going on all around. Uh the Germans uh shouting at uh all the Jews, all the Udenroust. Uh and uh we heard shots outside and uh--uh we stayed there until--you know the baby but it starts crying and the parent tried to shut the baby up but apparently uh a German cause whoever heard it, and they found the trap door and dropped a grenade and uh when the grenade exploded it injured one of the people who stood nearest the trapdoor. Everyone start- ed shouting and of course we were discovered. And uh we opened up the side door and started coming out. We were--were was it semi-dressed or uh. Uh and uh we're rounded up--lined up and--and marched off from that uh place, eventually to a railroad siting where we were Video Tape No.____ Camera Roll No. ____ Sound Roll No. ____ KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/JACOB LEWIN page 26 Interviewed (5-7-97) by Sandra W.

Uh, my brother--my brother was still not there but uh my father, my mother and I were in one of the cattle cars and uh--and my brother showed up and ran from cattle car to cattle car looking for us and when he found us, he hopped on and we were all on the cattle car being take out of Lithua- nia. Uh that was basically one of the uh scariest times, if you will, for me personally. Uh, although I've been scared before in the actions that we spoke about earlier. Uh, this was very frightening especial- ly when the grenade went off and we thought we were all going to be shot. Uh, that's basically all I can remember of--of--of that particular event. But it was uh perhaps the most dramatic event for me, at the time, as a child. SB: And do you think you could talk a bit about what you're--how you mother worked to save the family? JL: Yes, my mother uh--uh was pretty much uh the brain in--in--in the business and in the family. She was not Semitic looking. Uh light haired and uh spoke uh Russian, Polish, Lithuanian, German, and uh she was able to sustain us uh by sneaking out of the barbed wire fence in the middle of the night and visiting farmers in this outskirts of the ghetto. (Cough) And uh bartering and trading clothing and or pieced of jewelry for food. Nobody had butter for example. Uh we had butter cuz she was able to get it from uh the peasants, the farmers. Uh, uh nobody--I shouldn't say Video Tape No.____ Camera Roll No. ____ Sound Roll No. ____ KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/JACOB LEWIN page 27 Interviewed (5-7-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films, Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd, Potomac, MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: nobody but uh we wound up having uh pork, for example uh cause there was hardly any meat in the uh ghetto and from the rations that I recall. We were getting bread and maybe some margarine and maybe some marmalade or something and some potatoes. Uh, so uh she was uh--she did uh--quite often at the risk of her life and managed to come back every morning with a bundle of food for us. Uh she was uh--uh obviously awaring--alert to us what was going on and able to uh win over quite well under the circumstances. Uh and I believe that uh from a physical stand point and health stand point uh she was responsible for us being in reasonably good shape. At the end of the ghetto period, when we were taken to concentration camps, subsequently, still survive the concentration camps. Many people uh didn't quite make it because of poor nutrition, poor food and health reasons in the because the way we were able to sustain ourselves, I think we made it to uh--uh perhaps we had a little bit uh--uh my father, mother, my--my brother and I all survived uh the Holocaust and were liberated in Austria and Germany. So that uh I believe that she was the main contributor to our well being. SB: She sent you uh packing with cotton in your boots or something? JL: Yes. She uh--I was small stature. As a kid, I was not very large and I'm only 5'5" now. Or I was 5'5" a few years ago. Uh, so uh she felt if I looked bigger and taller that I would uh do a little bit better.

Bradley Wentworth Films, Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd, Potomac, MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: I had boots, ankle boots and she made me put cotton in the boots--in the heels to raise me by a couple inches. And I wore those boots throughout the concentration camp and I believe that eh at least in one of the concentration camp help me survive.SB: And you were on uh--riding down the road on trucks to the boats when you reunited with your brother. JL: After liberation in Austria, there were--there were a hundred and fifty Lithuanian kids who wound up uh from the Kovno ghetto uh in--in Lansbury which is near Dakaw and taken from Dakaw to Auschwitz and subsequent- ly--matter of fact there are about 50 of us survived out of the hundred and fifty. Uh most of us found ourselves in the uh--uh town called Welles, Austria. And we were rounded up by the U.S. authorities and uh put into a barracks--it use to be a German barracks. And a couple months later the Haganah showed up and I says, 'We want to go to Lithuania,' or Palestine at the time . And of course we had no knowledge of any family relationship or existence or anything. We were all on our own, uh we were--we said fine, you know, let's go. So they pull some trucks, in the kind of a maybe six or eight military trucks with the tarp over the top but the front of the tarp was open and I was standing at the head right over the driver's uh cabin. And uh the convoy had stopped on a highway in Austria. I believe there was a problem with a woman who had fainted or something. Uh, so the whole convoy came to a halt and as I was standing there uh looking down the road, Video Tape No.____ Camera Roll No. ____ Sound Roll No. ____ KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/JACOB LEWIN page 29 Interviewed (5-7-97) by Sandra W. Bradley Wentworth Films, Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd, Potomac, MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: (Crying) I saw my--I saw my brother coming and I spot- ted him. He took me off the truck and I didn't know that either he or--or my father or anybody survived so that uh he took me off the truck and took me back to where my father was which was Munich at the time. Uh, the rest of the convoy went on to the uh ships like the Haganah. Now the uh the edge of the ship--the famous story uh to uh immigrate legally into a Palestine. That's why I wound up in Munich and eventually the United States, instead of winding up in Israel. Uh, my mother is still not know of at the time and uh we lived in--in the Falofin DP camp for a while and then we had an apartment in Munich, afterwards. About a year or so later, a knock on the door and I open up the door and there was my mother. (Crying) So anyway all were (Cough) reunited in '46 or so and the rest is history. As they say.
