LILLY SCHWARZ GACH December 9, 1991 Q: Mrs. Gach, uh thank you for coming to visit with us this morning. We're going to be asking you uh to share with us some of your experiences as you recall them, and perhaps the best way to begin is to ask you to tell us your name and a little about your early life in Budapest. A: OK. My name is Lilly Brust Gach. I was born in uh Hungary in Europe, Hungary, Budapest, and uh I had a brother who was younger than I myself, ___ three years and uh we had a wonderful, happy family life and childhood. Beautiful. Well educated, if I may say so myself, both of us. Uh we had elementary school. Naturally we started with that. We don't have the kindergarten and what we have here, which is wonderful. From there we went to the high school. I was sent out to Vienna for my German, Switzerland to my...Swiss as to my French, and I was a happy-go-lucky girl. So was my brother. And uh we finished school. I got married very early, very happily, and uh then Eva was born. Made us more happy, and since then she's my...my life. My husband passed away here in this country, 1957, January. It's a long, long time. Q: OK. Let's go back then to the time when you were growing up in Budapest. You had mentioned that you had a happy childhood. A: Yes, I did. Q: Tell us about the changes that you remember in the life of the Jewish community in Budapest at whatever time you can recall. A: Well uh, the Jewish...how should I say it...as a young girl I was going to the big holidays with my mother. I can sit next to her and I was very proud being there. So was my brother who was sitting downstairs uh with my father, my uncle, and many other family uh and friends whom we know, and I was really brought up in a very warm, Jewish family. I wasn't too religious, but all the holidays we were keeping and we got together with the family, mother's, father's, and this was it. Q: And when did you first realize there were changes in the experiences of the Jewish community? A: That's a very good question, what you ask me. I realized the first time when I was in Vienna, Vienna, in the school _______, they call that. And uh I spoke fluently German because Austra-Hungarians we needed it...five hours only between Hungary and Vienna, so we we _____ the language. And we were ma king discussions from Vienna, and I saw certain signs which in German naturally I could read...and in English it would say, no Jews and dogs are allowed. Certain restaurants or buildings. I was reading it. I was even asking my teacher. I said what does this mean? I don't like that. USHMM ARCHIVES RG-50.030*0077 2 Q: Do you remember what year that was? A: Oh yes. Sure. It was in 1927. Q: 1937 I think... A: '27. '27. Q: OK. A: This is the first time that I went to Vienna . I was fifteen or sixteen years old. So she gave me a very interesting answer, and uh naturally whatever she said, it was fine. But I came back to Hungary and I told my parents. They said you couldn't read that. You you misunderstood. They didn't believe it. So I stopped asking because maybe I made a mistake. Even so I was reading fluently and these are two words which you cannot...I mean Jewish is Jewish...Juda...and dog is dog. ____. So this was...this was the first time, and it bothered me, but when, you know, young girl, going back to school and this was the end of it. Now then ______ in Europe what's going on. Naturally in Germany, so the _______...they always said it cannot happen to us. This was the motto. Then come closer. Hungary became...naturally was...we were allied with the Germans so nothing happened, but the minute...minute when uh we became part of the Allies, then we knew that we are Jews and there are enemies in our own country. Q: Let's go back then to the time the war actually began, in 1939 in Poland. How did it affect the Jewish community in Budapest? A: In a way there was a feeling that someth ing is wrong, but we didn't know what. Certain _____ the Germans are our allies, so they didn't touch us, but you could feel there is something in the air. You couldn't explain it. I remember we went with my husband to France just for a trip and uh we had friends over there. They said, are you going back? So we said what a question? Said don't you see what's going on? So I said yes, I don't care. Eva is home. Naturally we're going back, and we did go back. In 1940 my husband was invited...invited to be in the in the labor camp. Q: OK. Let's talk about that. In 1940, things changed in Budapest. How would you characterize the change? What do you remember? A: Well, first of all he went into the labor camp. Q: How did he go into the labor camp? A: He got a notice that uh he should uh go on this and this address and have a little bag for himself, the necessities...underwear, jacket, something like that. Good shoes. And he will USHMM ARCHIVES RG-50.030*0077 3 be notified where to go. When the paper comes, he should be ready, and then he will notify us where he is. We shouldn't worry, so I was worried. I don't have to tell you... Q: Do you remember who he got the paper from? A: Oh sure. Oh sure. Well, this was a paper from the Hungarian uh...what was that...uh ministerial (ph) that he is going in...some were called in for being soldiers. Then some were called in to the so-called labor camps. Each man that they were working on the highways. They went up to...they were taken up to the mountains. There was nothing for them, so they made their own ditches for uh important things and then they they got...uh they were putting up huts for them. They were put in a uh train which took them...in Hungary, we were still in Hungary...naturally I went out with him. And uh I was very upset. I I didn't know what's going on, so they're starting to read the letters or the telephone calls. I...we didn't know what...what is labor...labor...labor camps mean. Absolutely not. So then I started to work in uh his business and helping out and I was busy, and my daughter, naturally, and uh he wrote me a card. I showed you that I think. The first one and then the second one that uh he's alright. I shouldn't worry, and uh there are a lot of people there. He's very...not helpful because he is not uh a person who can work on the fields but anyway he's trying hi s best. The food is so...I should take care of Eva...all my love. Open card...this was all read by the people how I found out. Sometimes it was crossed...he said something not...not ____. Then I started to find out what that labor camp is, and uh I talked to some gentleman...I don't want to name...give his name because his family is here a very well-known name, but I will tell you later. And he loved my husband and I said well, listen. I would like to find out what we can do. So I said uh find out...uh I will find out and I let you know. Fine. He was...he was also Jewish. He was a highly regarded soldier from the 1st World War, so he was not a youngster, but he was very nice and I called him actually uncle. I don't know why. And uh so he found out that there is a doctor in my husband's uh labor camp, and he will talk to him. He will ask him to go to him and tell him how...what he fells, because he wasn't well, and so he got...he was going to the doctor and uh he gave him a paper that he is not well, and in two weeks he should come back, so he came home. So then... Q: So he was in a labor camp for how long? A: He was there uh a few months. I can't remember exactly. It started to come to winter, so for two weeks he was home. He told me or less how it's going...very hard, and naturally the captain who was running the show...he was nothing, absolutely nothing. I mean not qualified. He was... Q: OK. What did he do when he came home? A: First of all, he wanted to look around what...what he can do and I went up to the American Consul and told him that story, th at he cannot do it because he is...and I cannot, cannot, cannot. So I said oh, don't worry. It won't be too long, but you have your papers. USHMM ARCHIVES RG-50.030*0077 4 You have your family. Uh and uh so after two weeks he had to go back, to a different place. 101 ___________. This was his name...or this number of that camp. So I went with him and there they had permission once in a while when they came down from the mountains, coming into a town, that I could go there without they should know. A lot of wives, naturally, found that we had each other, and he came down with a sergeant. Load for food and to carrying up food to the mountains and all that, but he knew that I will be in this place, so we met there. They were lovely people. I never met them. They opened their house for us that we could sit down. He can take a bath and you know, important. Q: What did he do in that labor camp? A: The...always the same. Always the... Q: Which was? A: Which was they were working...excuse me...they were working on the fields. They were working there to set up uh uh houses...not houses. I mean there was huts...huts. It was...the winter came and they had no clothing. It was cold. There was nothing, so they...they were busy but with nothing. That's the honest truth. Just to keep them there. Q: And how long did he stay the second time? A: He was staying there for uh for half a year maybe or longer. Then there was a time that they changed places so he came back before they changed places uh spaces or ____ places. But I could see him...physically first of all he lost a lot of weight but this was the least, but inside something broke. He was a very cultured, intelligent, warm gentleman, and this killed him inside. And I could feel...that's why I tried whatever I could but you know, I'm not a psychologist or anything, just plain wife. He got another invitation. In the meantime my parents came back again to this country. Leslie left. It was 1940. He was working to get out just from that country to this country, to my parents. Immediately he went in to volunteer...there was no war in that year, but he wanted to do that, and uh they said alright. We'll put you down and that's OK. I don't know where he went. I think he went to Camp Kilmer (ph) that time. Q: And you and your husband and your daughter...? A: My husband was in labor camp. The...naturally the Americans and the English were bombing us because we were enemies. Let me tell you honestly, I said thanks God...thank them all. I couldn't...I didn't think about it what happens to our building where we were living because we don't even own that. I didn't mind we die, hopefully all three in the same time, but this cannot go on. We had bombs...the houses are down. There was no food. You know, war but I see now it just comes back. Q: And in 1941... USHMM ARCHIVES RG-50.030*0077 5 A: ...one...he came back again but that time it was bad. This was a __________, which means ____ Jews, or a percentage. I was running still his business. It was...nothing happened to it, but it was very hard because I was a woman and I I wasn't a business woman but uh just used my little brain what I had and I kept...we had to pick up gentile people to keep the numerous clauses...let's say I could have x percent Jewish people. Then had to have at least eighty percent non-Jewish people. We had a lot of non-Jewish people in the business because...with my husband, when he was a young man and they were excellent with us. I mean... Q: Did your husband have anything to do with the Jewish community during that period of time? A: Oh yes. Oh yes. Definitely yes. Q: What did he do? A: He was in the...in the...how do you do...what is the name of that uh...in the business section and uh uh helping out the community in collecting money for them, but he was not a collector. He was just taking like like in the government, you have a person who is running the show and then you tell them what to do, so he was the top man almost in that...in that... Q: Was it the community council that he was...? A: Yes. Yes. That's the name. Yeah. He was a community councilor. He was sitting up. He wasn't sitting in his regular seat, you know, there and my uncle, my father was not...he was sitting down. Q: So he was involved in... A: Definitely. Definitely. What to bring. What to take. What to send. What to buy. Naturally, this is volunteer work. You don't get paid for that. Q: And what years was he doing that? A: He was doing that for...even before he star ted to...let's say before 1939 because he didn't start with that. This was an honor and...for him...and he felt that he was honored with that, that... Q: So he continued to do that when he returned from the labor camps? A: That's right. Then he went back and we got a telephone call that...don't come back to the business because it's not yours anymore and we give it to another firm. Good. So he USHMM ARCHIVES RG-50.030*0077 6 never went back. The bank account was closed. And this was it. We were still at our home, became a Jewish house because he worked it out because he was up there. Q: What does it mean...it became a Jewish house? A: It meant that uh gentile people who were living in the house, houses where we were living, if they want to they can go out and they can take other houses where the Jews will be taken out from their apartment and they can have better apartments or whatever, and these people will _____ and all these people, not one couple left our building, and there was at least fifty-fifty. Q: Who established your house as a Jewish house? A: The Jewish _______. You had to ask for it. You had to have a reason because there are more Jews than gentiles for we should stay there. Now he was really there as a councilor and he said listen, we are fifty-four percent at least, and if you can do it, and I bring in in our apartment in every room some friends of ours...husband, wife, children, so according to that we had like six-room apartment here and they Ok'd it and the owner of the building Ok'd it, and so in every room we had a couple friends. I had an aunt and her husband and a son. He was sent to labor camp, shot in the ____ with a child, and she was without. Then we had different friends. One is up in Toronto. Another one in ... Q: But during this period of time...? A: We were together. Q: You lived in a safe house? A: Yes. We were living in a safe house, yes. Q: And that was the term that you used for the Jewish house? A: Yes. This is what we used. Q: And your husband during those periods of time when he was living with you in the Jewish house, maintained his contact with the... A: With the Jewish _______...this was the only place he could go. There was nothing for him anymore. Q: During the time he was in the Jewish ______, did he have any occasion to visit with or meet with representatives of the government? A: You mean with the Hungarian government? USHMM ARCHIVES RG-50.030*0077 7 Q: Yes. A: Uh I couldn't tell you that. I can't remember that really, because they were not important in a way. They didn't have any demands on on the Jewish ______ except that we should pay more taxes because the ______ had a....the Jewish ______ has a certain tax. We we we paid that. But nothing. The first one was when the Germans came in which was in 1944. There was no more labor camp for him, and uh the minute when we became allies to the Allies, then naturally the Germans who were allies became enemies Q: And how did that manifest itself? What did you see? A: Well, first of all, in our buildings were people, German-speaking people...one from Austria, a few from Germany...(cough-clearing throat) and we all spoke German and many other...a few other languages, and we got very friendly. They were younger people and they were out of their home, so they figured we invite them. They had beautiful libraries. Come over for a cup of coffee or some Hungarian cookies, you know, and they came over. When the Germans came over...took over, and I'm using the elevator, I see one of my favorite ones...he was the youngest. He was a Viennese and I knew Vienna very well. It was...I was there in school a long time ago then and uh he said, ____, what do I do now? I mean you...are you an enemy? I said I am never...I will be never an enemy and I am with you and whatever I can do, I'll do it. So this was a very good feeling and I didn't know...should I ask him to come in or shouldn't I? So I talked it over with my husband. I said...don't change. As what he said, you take his words. If he wants to, he comes in anyway, so don't say no, and he was right, so he came in and we were there. One night around two-thirty...in the...it morning...sorry...somebody knocks our door, and _______. This was the time when the Germans collected the people...two thirty in the morning. Nobody...everybody was sleeping so they could do that. He comes in. We we we were frightened, really very frightened, and he says listen...he was working for the Germans in the short-wave radio which means that he heard everything what came into Hungary and he was sending it over to Germany. He said I just heard that the Swedish king is giving a so-called schutzpass (ph)...papers who can prove that they were working with with Sweden or they have familie s in Sweden...they will tell you if you have anything like that. I know that your husband is bringing in paper from Sweden, rolls with _____, and uh because we were importers, so please, this what I heard. Ask him to go up to the...one of the...on the Buda (ph) side, which are the _____ side, go over there. Tell you heard that...you can mention even my name...it's official...and tell them what you know, what you have, business. They will check it and then you can have a Swedish uh paper that you are a Swedish...Swedish uh subject. Well, we couldn't believe it. My husband the next...this was early morning...two o' clock. At nine o'clock he was up there. He crossed the Danube on the on the bridge and he found it and he told his name and he was telling the name of the factories what he was repre...representing and bringing a lot of lot of papers and uh with the papers were boxes, papers for for...______ for using package, newspapers...you know, the big rolls...so it was quite an ordeal, and they USHMM ARCHIVES RG-50.030*0077 8 checked it. Naturally no time did they know the factory. They called it and they said oh yes, he's one of our biggest but we don't hear from them. Whatever you can say...I know Mr. Brust very well, or Herr Brust possibly and uh so he got...we were _____. I think we were the number...it's on the schutzpass what I brought to you...the number thirty-four, thirty-five...very...in the beginning, which meant we are Swedish subjects. We do not have to wear the stars, the Jewish stars which was recommend. It had to be done, which killed me morally because to be...you know, I can sit on the...and I cannot sit in the normal seat, let's say take a bus or sub...or a streetcar. I had to sit in the back. I could...you know, this was something which which...it's unbelievable. So we got that and _____ was an angel. Q: How did that change your life, having the schutzpass? A: Well, I felt uh a little bit easier, but I was ashamed and sad and very sad. First of all, I have a daughter and I had a husband. After I saw him what's going on with him and what happens to her. I mean this is...I give her birth. I mean we give her birth, so after all my husband has...my brother went out and I got letters from Zurich that I had relatives through my mother's side (coughing-clearing throat). My mother had wrote that Leslie's fine and he's wearing with big honor the...his new country's uniform because he became a a soldier and uh... Q: But you in the time that you're describing now, when you had the schutzpass, you had been living in Budapest... A: Budapest. Q: ...and your husband was not working. A: No. Q: How did you support yourselves? A: I don't know. I don't know. We started to...until we had money touched...that we could touch our money, we bought food and we filled up our pantry but uh there was time that we had once a day food and Eva was a poor eater anyway. Now that she didn't have that much money and that that that food what she liked, so she started to eat less and this broke my heart. Q: So up until 1944, life was not too difficult? A: No, but uh you couldn't...uh there were restric tions. You couldn't do this. At five o'clock you had to be home and uh the family who came living with us and the gentiles were really nice. No problem, and they helped us. They brought us food and they said don't USHMM ARCHIVES RG-50.030*0077 9 worry. We will survive and then you'll give us back whatever we spent on you, or we give something for them, you know, whatever we had in our apartment. Q: OK. So we've now established that through a period of time there were difficulties, but it wasn't all that difficult for you. When did it become actually a serious...? A: We became...yes...when we were told that we should move in from that Jewish house uh to the Swedish house, because they cannot...the Germans won't respect our Jewish house and they will just...we we saw it. I mean they collected people on the street. They came in in the houses and uh in the morning, two, three o'clock. Uh in the meantime, the big war, the Germans went all over Europe. It started in Holland, in Belgium, always in the early morning and we heard that. Q: What did you hear...that people were being collected? A: First of all we didn't have a radio. We were not allowed to have a radio, so the big one...we had a big, old-fashioned radio...there was no television at that time...they took it away, but my husband had a small one, and we put it in his drawer, and he opened Churchill...German...I mean England. Q: What was it that you were hearing that was happening to the Jewish people who were being taken away? A: Well, everything what what went on... Q: Which was...? A: First of all in Austria, they collected th e people. They went...they were taken to certain uh...even in my family. They were picked up and disappeared, and we didn't know. A cousin of mine who is here in this country...he's quite a young man...he's not a young man anymore...he and his mother were taken. Then we got a card, a postcard, some kind of...what is that...uh sea...not sea...uh uh what is that...it is like a uh.... Q: The specific place isn't important. A: No. Anyway, he got a card...we got a card that he is _____. Q: _____ yes. A: _______ is a little...uh it's not an ocean. It's like a... Q: It's a sea. A: No, it's not a sea. It's it's a standing water. And you can swim in it. USHMM ARCHIVES RG-50.030*0077 10 Q: It's a lake. A: It's a lake. I should know that. That was...I'm going absolutely... Q: The question that I was asking was in reference...? A: My husband was always in the Jewish ____. I showed him, look here what what what we got from Steven. So he said I just wanted to let you know. You know what that is...this is Auschwitz. I said what is that. And he got the notice from the...in the meantime is that Wallenburg showed up. Of course, he was an angel sent from God. I met him twice when I was going for my husband. I didn't want him to go alone on the street, and uh... Q: Before we get to Mr. Wallenburg, I'd like to go back to that point about the Germans were collecting people... A: Collecting people from their home. They take them out. They had a big truck down on the street. They were pushed in in the car. They never knew then where they're going, how long do they...will they be away, nothing. Q: But you did get some indication that some... A: We thought they are disappearing. In the meantime we heard the BBC, late evening, you know, quietly. Q: Saying...? A: And then Mr. Churchill and the English uh tele...uh radio told us what's going on in the war. Q: What did they tell you? A: They told us there is an Auschwitz. There is a Mauthaussen. There is a Theresienstadt. We had never heard that. Q: And what did they tell you was going on? A: That this is a collection where the Hungari an people or wherever they are from Europe, they are put...they are put in a in a train without food. Everything is taken away from them before and then the left-over when they arrive and uh they are put in in ovens. So I said well, the English, I love them but uh they are crazy. How can they say that? I mean this is...it's impossible. You know, everybody said that because you don't believe that. So then Steven's first card came from _______ and my husband says, you know what this is? This is Auschwitz so I want to tell to my friends in the...with whom we are living still in USHMM ARCHIVES RG-50.030*0077 11 our old house, in our old apartment, and we told...he told them. He was almost killed by our friends. They said you are crazy. You're picking up this news...this is...there is no such thing. And even so, if you hear it, tell it to Lilly, to your wife. Don't tell us because we don't believe it. Q: And that was...that was...? A: Don't ever say that. Just tell me. I want to know every word you want to say. Because I didn't want him to hold back. Q: OK. So... A: Then we went over to the Swedish house. Q: And what was it like in the Swedish house? A: This is a very beautiful house, four or five floors and uh we had the paper from the Swedish king that we are...we can stay there. We went in, early morning. Kitchen was full with mattresses. Everything was mattresses. So I said, you know...I was frightened and my husband says, you know, I don't want to stay there. So Eva said I am tired. I want to stay there. I sit down. She has this doll and uh a tack board (ph), ____. So I said leave it there sweetheart, and we will...doll here or a book and take the doll...now I remember well...and we will be back. We disa...we went out. They said don't forget you have to be back until five. ___________. We never came back, because we decided but this is a collection for only Jews. The Germans was eating up Europe. Why should they stop in Hungary? There is no reason. They are in and they own us, so when they know...let's say the end...there is an end. They will still finish up the people in a collected house. He was absolutely right. I was upset because I couldn't believe that this can be. Q: And where did you go? A: We figured out that we are going in one of our own buildings in which we gave the the...an apartment as a superintendent to one of my husband's workers. He was with him for...he was a young man, still my husband, when he was working in the business there. He was paper importer. He was quite a nice man. I knew his wife. I knew his son and we gave him that apartment. I don't know why that he should be our super in a no-charge apartment. It was a heated apartment. This was brand new. I mean, very modern. We didn't have too many like that. Q: You had mentioned a moment ago that you met Mr. Wallenburg. A: Yes. Yes. Q: Was it at this time? USHMM ARCHIVES RG-50.030*0077 12 A: Uh Wallenburg was...I met him before we went to hiding. I was still a Jewish passport and I tell you how I met him. I picked up my husband and there was a big conference, and he was uh...my husband and the Jewish ____, the people, the President whom I knew very well there, Mr. Stern (ph), uh they had a big...and my husband said sit in in the back and just listen. You know that man? I said yes, I heard him but I never met, so he introduces...a very tiny looking, blue-eyed, blondish skinny man. If you would see him on the street, you wouldn't say oh my God, I have to look back, you know, because he's nothing. Very simple. And I listened. He spoke uh German and uh naturally and uh I listened and he said listen...I know, you have to tell me what you can do for the Germans, and you have to tell me what the Germans are telling me, telling you. Let's say they are collecting uh uh this part of the cou...of of the city or this part and I will be there and I try to stop the train that it shouldn't go, and _________ and then he repeated it, so this was...this was something you can believe it. We still didn't believe it that this can be but he he said you also have it. So we gave him...every morning almost he was in. When he...when they...he knew that the train comes and picks up the people, he was there, early morning, late evening. Q: What did he do? A: First of all, he gave...uh he had papers. He said he's coming with me. I know...I need him. He is...he's Swedish. He's French. You name it...stories. These were very simple Germans there. Naturally, I'm not talking ______ because they were killers, and a lot of people were saved through him. He actually...happene d that he stopped a a train...complete...one train. Not...I don't know how many, but just one part of the train. There were women, children and elderly or sick. Q: Where did they go once the train was...? A: He was sending...he...I can't tell you that. That's the honest truth. I don't know where they went, but wherever they went, the old came mostly who didn't die the natural death, came back. He was a miracle. Q: During the time that you described your meetings with Mr. Wallenburg and his activities... A: Yes, twice I saw him. Q: ...were there any senior German official s with whom you or your husband had occasion to meet? A: Yes. Mr. Eichmann. Q: Mr. Eichmann? USHMM ARCHIVES RG-50.030*0077 13 A: Eichmann.

A: He came into the Jewish _____. He said I am so and this is my name or his title...I don't remember what he was...and I am talking for my government. Now we are...we were allies and now we are enemies but we are still allies and when you want to uh have your...have your...the the freedom a few Jewish people, and I will have request for you, and if you can give it to me, I will take a few out and they can stay or we're going to send them...they don't go too far. We put them in the train, nice story. They will work. They will help us out in the factories here, factories there and that's all. Now we knew this wasn't true because we heard the BBC. This was our...this was the bible because we knew the truth. Q: So Eichmann was telling you the story...? A: Eichmann did that, so he came in and he said I need now I don't know how many beds.

My little daughter, Eva was up with the super. She didn't look like a little girl from the country. She looked like a city girl, gray suit with long hair, and there was coming in a woman from the building...a lovely looking...I never met her before, and she asked...this I know from our super...asked uh who's that little girl?

My daughter got up immediately when she talked to her, and uh she said oh this is my sister's daughter, my son's nephew...my sister 's daughter...she's my my uh...niece, and just for a short time and she goes back to the countr y. When she says to...she told me the story and uh the janitor, the super...I I I didn't believe what I heard. She made a funny face and then she said listen. She was a gentile woman. She lived in our building. She said I am going up to the mountains for uh skiing. I give you my keys for my apartment. This was very unusual because we then...we did not have keys. We didn't give keys to the super. Here I do, because this is the way they have it, but uh there we didn't. We said there was always somebody at our apartment, most of the time, and she said if you want to you can use it or you want to put something in or take out something, I will be out there. Her husband was a Jewish man who had a white...not yellow star...a white band, because he was half...married to a gentile so this gave him...he wasn't taken out from the country. This was the story. I never met him. I never her. So they left. Joseph comes in, down to USHMM ARCHIVES RG-50.030*0077 16 the basement and says you know, we are going up...around five o'clock I'm going up to the _____. ____ down into the basement. It was horrible down there. It was just horrible. Q: In what way was it horrible? A: First of all, it was cold. You had a tank for the heating system which did not work because they didn't put the heat on. We were...we heard the Germans...the the planes. We heard the Russians. We heard boots. We heard the war on the street. We...people came in the building, Russians or the Germans. They were...any Jews here? They said that. Nobody. So we will go around and see. Well, you know, to sit down in the basement and waiting for them to come down, so Joseph said can I get you...this was...I never forget that...can I get you a cup of tea. It's not too good but luckily our teapot...whatever we had then. And they were so cold the Russians, so they sat down and they said thank you and uh I picked up naturally a few Russian words then and almost talked, not at that time but after, and they left so then Joseph came down and said I take you up to an apartment. You don't move. I bring you food, and I gave him my keys and I said you go over to my old apartment. Whatever there you can carry, bring it over to your kitchen and from there give us a little fruit...food. Your wife, you cook whatever and Eva should get some hot food. So this what happened. He went up to this apartment, to this woman's apartment. Now I...we were...we stayed there for two weeks. I tell Joseph, Joseph put a little heat on. Everybody who is in the building should have heat, but it's not allowed. Don't worry. Nobody will ask you that why do we have heat. They will be happy. They will give you a tip for that. I was right, so at least we didn't...we were in an apartment. This was a one bedroom apartment, one...living room, bedroom...or two bedrooms. The child had a bedroom and Eva was there. We had linens. It was clean. Q: And the war was going on around you? A: And the war was absolutely going on. We were bombing day and night. Q: And how long did that last?

So he said I want to talk to ____. I have an apart...uh a home up on the mountains, which is a beautiful _____. We had there too but we didn't talk about it, and this was given by a Jewish family that we should take care of it, and this is empty. We are going up there. We don't want to stay in the city. I want to have these three people, so we went up to that apartment. Finally, the husband, who was an officer of the Hungarian army, was in Russia, was all over the German army because we were allies. He came home without permission. He was afraid. The Germans...he was not the Germans anymore, with the Germans because they became enemies. He was with the Russians, but he was in Russia with the Germans, so this was a very unpleasant feeling for him, and he was afraid so he left the army. He took...they took off his army stuff except a beautiful jacket which he picked up in Germany...in Russia, with uh fur...fur-lined, and he came up and so we got in to this apart...to this beautiful house.

This was ___ too, a very nice looking man, and the wife and the wife's mother, and they had a child which remain still in correspondence, in Hungary. Uh...

On the contrary, they are allies, but I didn't know that. So they came from house to house and they came into our house. The first one was ______, which means give me your watch. And this was a nightmare. Your not stealing from my hand. So my husband said in Hungarian, give it to him. After I gave it to him, he gave it back to me. He had at least ten watches on his arm.

So our friends who owned...that owned what he was taking care of the house, he had a son, my daughter, and there was another unpleasant child which she never met before, and they were the owner's son. He was there with a little house in the back, and they were hidden there. So so we were very...then ___ cames out with his beautiful fur-lined coat. When that Russian sees that...he was not a tall man, the Hungarian fellow...he picked him up like that and ____ where did you get that coat? This is a Russian...he spoke Russian. He said I got it...I was in Russia as an officer...or as a prisoner. It wasn't true but he was stealing it from the Russian which was...they steal from him. They were stealing from him, so he was stealing back and he was cold. He didn't believe that and then...but he put him down and he said keep your coat, but we are here now and you will help us speaking Hungarian and Russian, so he was like, you know, helping out, translating.

A big Russian...it was late evening...he comes in to the...the Germans are coming back. We take you down. We belong to them. And we didn't mind. To get Russian is better than the Germans.

It was a...it was a completely different little town, a village which the Russians took over from the Germans and there were bodies...German bodies. ___ that we had to get out from the trunk, from the truck and uh we were lined up. I said to my husband, Eva stays with...before me because if they shoot me I want she should be shot too, and then next you. I didn't want to leave the child alone. And we were ready for that, and then one of the Russians came in and said what are you doing? I brought them down. They are our people, so they went back. They didn't shoot us. They were ...was starting to get dark, and we were still walking. Eva was before me. She was...I want to go back. I want to slow down. I didn't let her...permit her to go...permit to go in the back.

It sounded beautiful. I always said, don't you want to...I want to be Brust. So I said fine, and we are Brust _____, so I told my name that we are that. You come with us, and some other people with whom we met there, so we went there, and he had a little house and he had a basement for I don't know what, maybe washing or...we didn't have washing machines...and he gave us that and he gave...uh there was a mattress, two mattresses, and there was a...

They...sometimes they came in in the houses and uh brought some food or...and that we should do it ____ food and we should do it, and I wasn't a good cook and my husband had no idea what what cooking is, but there were others, so we helped. And then what they didn't use, they didn't eat up, they left it for us, but we couldn't do anything with that, but we were afraid from them. That's the honest truth. Even so they were liberating and I felt that uh they won't harm us, uh it was a very difficult time. Q: Was there any characterization of your being Jewish at that time? A: Uh this is very funny. Once a high officer, greyªhaired, tall man...I can see his face ____ like a wild animal in the...in that little whatever that was and uh he said who you, who you, who you?

So he said no, no. I don't harm him...her. So this...this was the end of the beginning. So uh...alright...so he...because you asked about Jewish, so he asked us, are you Jewish, or are you Catholic? Hungary is a Catholic country. And we didn't look Jewish, let's put it that way... no characteristics, nothing like that. So my husband...again, he was the cleaver...he said we are Jews and running from the Germans. Don't forget they were not allies anymore. They were against each other, so he goes into his pocket and I thought, my God, he will shoot us. He takes out a little prayer book and gives it to my husband. He cannot read Hebrew so I cannot either. I learned it in school because we have...the the Jewish children go to the Jewish uh religious hour and the Catholics to the Catholic ____, same time.

He gave candy to Eva and he said, I am a Jewish Russian Jew and I promised myself that whenever I see a child, German or anything, I just do the same what they did to my children. They throw them out in the window. Funny. When he took Eva, I got frightened. I didn't know what it was. So he said I don't do anything to you. I bring you food until he was stationed in there and he did. Eva came back to me, naturally. She didn't even realize what went on, you know, because she didn't believe in bad and good. In good she did, but not in bad things. That man was for a few days there. Then he disappeared. They were picked up with, you know, with the army and they went. Then we went to clean. I always carried Eva. I never took my husband. He was staying there. I ___ cleaning up a place where the horses were and the cows were, ___ like that.
