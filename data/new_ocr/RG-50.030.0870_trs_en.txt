Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 34 Q: This place that you moved to, what was that like. A: It was like two bedrooms and a kitchen. On the first floor. Was a small house.

A: No there was a barbed wire around the ghetto. But later on they took they gave work and they, there was like the highway was wired with barbed wire but in one place was a bridge to go to the other side of the ghetto. And when they took us to work there was no school so they took us to work. And I worked and it was called klein mabel Fabrik . They made for the children there what do you call it. The play pens, the children™s cribs. Q: Small furniture for small children. A: Children and also handles for a pail you know the wooden handle, like the carved wood. And I helped there because I was a Juden teacher. Q: You were a youth. Then you were a teenager. Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 35 A: Teenager so I was working there and there was a supervisor for the kids to see how they treat them. So of course the people that were, they were also tired and hungry because in the ghetto already started now not the same food. We didn™t, we couldn™t buy food. Only what we got. Q: Was there any possibility to keep kosher at all? A: Oh we couldn™t. We were happy to get some barley and potatoes, big deal. And we got already the portions of the bread. But we had t o pay for it too. So we worked. They paid something, not much. So in the ghetto there wasn™t food already. There was a, so the first year when we had to leave the house we had no, we didn™t get any coal to heat the house. So that they had the barns. The boys broke it down. And we used the wood and the next year in spring we turned the ground and we took the eyes from the potatoes, you cut out the eyes from the potato. And you put it in the ground upside down. And we turned the ground and there was a pump downstairs so we got to work. And when I came home from work I was taking care of the garden, I was the gardener. So we had potatoes, a little tomatoes, we planted things. Of course there was no gates so people stole they were hungry. But the potatoes underground was a big help. To get w hat to eat. Q: Unusual that you would have a plot of land to be able to plant it. A: No because we broke down that we needed the wood. Q: You needed the wood and so the land the barn was on.

You know to be honest -- Q: You don™t know A: No my si ster worked in an office and my brother worked in a factory someplace. Q: Your mother, did she also go to work or did she stay home with the other. Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 37 A: With the babies she stayed home. They were little babies so you couldn™t leave them. The second year all they took to the straw factory. They did work. And my father was a problem because Saturday he didn™t want to work so the meat, there was horsemeat. Horsemeat isn™t kosher. My father never ate meat in the ghetto. He never ate, but the children they were hungry and they were growing so he permitted to what they gave we ate. But my father didn™t eat the meat. Q: The Lodz ghetto was one of those that existed the longest during the war and it was run by Œ A: Hiram Kofsky . Q: Did your fam ily have any dealings with him. Did he touch your lives in any way? A: No, he made up even songs like you know songs that were like sarcastic. Rum Kofsky Haim , [Getus Kleim and Ketenes Groten and Ketenes Man] Grot means barley. It was like demanded what gave in the wilderness so we felt everything in the man because there was no food but it fell down from heaven. Q: Like the manna did. A: Yes. So they made a joke like he gives us barley. He made the ghetto was a getta and he says it™s gereft . So that was like his song, like he™s a kidder. Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 38 Q: Did people not like him very much? A: No. But it wasn™t his fault. He did what he had to do. Q: Did you ever see him? A: Yeah we saw him . Not very much, not very much like there were stations where you picked up the bread for the week and the bread was so heavy because should weigh more. I t wasn™t very well baked. But somehow we bought because my father was in the city so we had some extra money to buy on the black market. There was a black market. Q: In the ghetto A: Yeah you know. People that were by foot like it™s all open so they tried to take something home. They didn™t have money to buy it. Out the card, the rations, so they had the money so they had some flour so you can buy a little flour so my mother baked something on Friday. So we were a little better off. Q: Your father was he able Œ A: That was til 1940 when the Russian war broke out. Everybody went to ghetto. Then it was finished. Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 39 Q: That™s what my question was.

We were in the ghetto til 1944, August 24, 1944, we left the ghetto. Q: Tell me some other things about ghetto life, before we get to that point. You™re in the ghetto then for a good four and five years. That™s a very long time. From the time that you are 14 years old til the time you are 18 or 19. A: No I was 18. Q: You were 18. A: So it was I worked there and then the men came from the school department and he said I am good so they took me to their office to do the evidence. Every morning that when you came to work in the factory, had to go to the office to report. That you are here and you had a cell number, the floor number where you worked and everywhere they had a number a registry number. I happened to have a good memory so I worked in the evidence. After a year or so they Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 40 took me to work in the office. So I was in the registry office. So it was a little easier because I remembered so went first. When people came to work in the morning they had to register. Q: And they registered then with you. A: Yes there were more than me just. There were some other girls too. Q: Were the conditions easier in the of fice than Œ A: Yes you had to carry the heavy wood pieces. They were heavy sticks for the furniture and also we had to chisel. It was hard on the fingers. Q: Office work is easier. A: Much easier. Q: Was it warmer, did you get any extra food? A: No, food extra no. You go the soup and you got the piece of bread. That™s all you got. Q: We were talking about office work and work in the factory itself. I wanted to ask a larger question. Were you always hungry or were you not so hungry in the ghetto. Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 41 A: You see it was hard there for boys because I didn™t grow too much. Anymore because there wasn™t the food what teenagers eat. But I wasn™t so hungry because they used to give kohlrabi. I didn™t like it. But you, I was occupied in the garden. I had this, but the boys were hungry. I could have used another piece of bread but you couldn™t complain because what would they do to, it was much harder for the grown boys. Q: Were there many German soldiers in the ghetto. Did you see many of them? A: In the ghetto. They were guarding by the wires. By the barbed wires. That people shouldn™t run out from the ghetto. Q: But they didn™t patrol the ghetto. A: They patrolled it then the borders. The Germans came every so often. They came to grab the people wherever they could. They took them to concentration camps before us. We were the last transport and they take, took children. They took men. I had an aunt that lived from my mother™s side. When they had the rations they came and they went into every house to seize the people. And they took out whoever they wanted. Old people, young people. So my father we had the, it was a small house and under the steps was a place where you could go in so my father opened the floor. He cut the floor open and he made a hiding place. They shouldn™t come there because they took children and everybody to take for killing. So when they were the rations we lived on, it was like you see here, ( gesturing with hands in circular motion ) the streets went like this s o like you lived on this side of the street, on the other side. There was a small place that you could Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 42 go through to the other street without going around. So this place when they, the ration, when there were Auslang there were -- Q: Where they were taki ng people away A: People away. My brother bought a band as a policeman and he came to warn us we should hide in the hiding place. Q: Your brother was working as a ghetto police person. A: No he just -- Q: He just got the band A: He just got the band . He wasn™t a policemen . He just got the band. For the, from the police station. He pay something like a loaf. So he came so we went down with the children. Also was an old lady. My father she could, they also were afraid they™d take the old people for killing too. So we he dug it, a hole and from the center he made two like benches to sit. He put a piece of board so that people could hide there. and we knew that if we heard the steps so we locked the children™s mouth. He shouldn™t hear noises. And when they went away someone brought the key and that we could go out so that we could go into the houses. Q: Did this happen a lot? In your home? Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 43 A: It, it happened. It happened. The last time it happened my mother was so scared because there were shots outside and she imagined that they killed my brother so we gave up and we went away with, but it was already the end. Two weeks later the whole ghetto was evacuated. Q: I see. So that™s at the end of the time. But throughout the ghetto time, you had so many small children in your family. It was a risk. A: Yeah who had to hide. It was a risk because they took away, they had no use for small children, so they killed them . They killed them. We don™t know where they took them. My aunt we heard, she had two boys. Her husband ran to Russia and she was stayed with two boys so she lived not far from us and we took her in whenever she was all alone. So she™s also residing there. And we heard that they took them to the ocean, to the boat to the ocean and they threw this transport of people into the ocean alive. We didn™t know what happened but then we heard from people after the war. That™s what happened. So she had two boys. One was nine, one was eleven. And the husband died in Russia. He never c ame back. Q: In the ghetto, did you see people starving? Did you see people dying in the ghetto? When you were there. A: Well going. No it was closed after a certain time. In the beginning of January, February 1940 was closed the ghetto. Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 44 Q: What I mean is within the ghetto during the years that you lived Œ A: Was people yes. After work there wasn™t people that lived in the area you saw. You didn™t have time to go because we worked . Q: My question was different . My question was did you see people dying. Did you see people hungry? A: Oh yes, you saw people like skin and bone because they couldn™t live from what they lived. And sometimes they were older people they didn™t even have the money. You had to pay for it too. To buy it. So they thought and it happened that people kept the corpse to get the food. They kept the corpse, people, after they died to, to get. They were hungry so they got the food to they could live. Yes, they were starving. Was very bad. We were hungry in the ghetto. There w as a joke that was a song in and I have for you a good thing. A roll with butter that this would be the best thing for you. You know like a little something. So the other boy answered I cannot, I cannot laugh because if I look at my sick old father I cann ot laugh and I cannot enjoy anything. You know a child™s conversation was in a song they made up jokes but it was not a joke. Q: It was through tears. (both talking) Did your parents™ personalities change at all through these types of hardships. A: Of course they changed but you, main thing in a Jewish family is your family. That™s what Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 45 you live for, for your family and to help people if you can. A person isn™t born just for your self. You were born here, but sometimes I need you, sometimes you need me but people need people. I don™t know if I am expressing myself. Q: Absolutely perfectly. I™m just wondering how your mother and father took it, how they were able to handle this cause they have nine children. A: My brothers were, my brother was already big and the ones that were over ten, you know you grow up fast then in a big family. Over ten, eleven, twelve, you already people. You had responsibilities. In a big family somehow everybody is close. We cared for each other. Q: Did that help you survive do you think? A: Yes, yes. How we survived you know. Sometimes people ask how did you survive. Honestly I don™t know. God wanted it, it was the way. Then when they sent us to Auschwitz and when they shaved our hair, I didn™t see, I couldn™t rec ognize my sister next to me. My other sister went with my mother, straight off then and I saw through the bath house where they were where we took the baths and when they cut us off the hair. W e were standing ( points at camera ), there was big windows downstairs and there were people standing outlined and I think I saw my father with the two, took , all the boys like eight, eight, nine, ten and my mother we never saw since we left the train that brought us to Auschwitz. I never saw her. But the capo that took us off was a Jewish police. My sister went with my mother so he told her don™t go there. This way they going to kill you. They burn and they gas you, and they burn you. So she said no it™s my children. I Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 46 want to go with them. They took, they told us that the mothers will take care of the children, which wasn™t true, wasn™t true. It wasn™t. And on the way when we went from the baths to the, to the barracks where we stayed, there was a big road with puddles and they didn™t give us shoes. So we wal ked on the road. Oh you leaving. ( someone off camera says they are leaving ) Q: Let™s step back a little bit. I want to hear everything that you have to say about this but let™s step back and paint a picture . In a sense you™re saying that the last time y ou hid under the stairs in the ghetto, your mother was frightened because she heard shots. A: We heard shots outside. Q: So then what happened? A: So she said, she was very, she was hysterical. And we were still in the hole there. The last time we didn™ t see until we saw him we didn™t know that he is alive. So my mother said to my father he cannot take it what would be. So it looks like the end. So my father knew something about Auschwitz. So we went on those, you could only take a bag, a duffel bag on the -- Q: So you left your hiding place. A: With nothing. Left the hiding place, went upstairs. We ate something. When they came next time we were there. They took us. Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 47 Q: So it wasn™t that time, but it was the next time. A: Yes. Q: And they took you to Œ A: To Auschwitz. That was it was about two weeks later the ghetto was liquidated. Q: So it was August 1944. A: Yes. We left on the 24 th and Œ Q: Were all of you together, all nine children A: All way we™re together. You know was, was reall y we struggled to be together. And but we all went. And then when the train stopped my father was went down and he saw the sign Auschwitz. He knew about Auschwitz. We didn™t know. Q: How do you know he knew? A: What. Because he told my brother an d my older sister, don™t tell mommy anything. It™s not good. And he gave us, he had some, when he sold the merchandise from you know when the Germans bought the merchandise. So he bought diamonds because you couldn™t run with the Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 48 merchandise and you couldn™t run with money. So he bought diamonds. So he get all the children. He gave each one a diamond and I had a wisdom tooth here ( points to jaw ). I had a cotton over. So I put one diamond. He gave me two. One diamond here and one here ( points to other side of jaw ) and I didn™t know what ever he gave me. I tried, he said if you have to save your life, give it away. Or if you need to get food or anything. He knew something what was going on. So he give all the older children, the three older children, four older children, my sister too. But she, and Œ Q: Was this in the train going to Auschwitz? A: Before we went off the trains he gave us. (both talking) In Auschwitz yeah he gave us this. So, so I put one ( points at jaw ) here , but the night when I saw we went to the barracks. On the way we saw in the distance a white, in white uniforms a band was playing Vienna waltz. And in the background we heard the screaming. To deaden down the screaming so the band was playing very loud. But you could still hear something. And then my throat got so dry, when I wasn™t hungry, I wasn™t thirsty. I was just feeling like I am choking. Because I knew what™s going to happen. He said, he told us open that they gas you and they burn you. So I imagine all this. And then we went to the barracks. You™re tired. I didn™t, we didn™t eat and we didn™t drink. And the first night we slept on the floor. Q: Was your whole family still together? A: No, no. Just me and my sister. Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 49 Q: The older sister. A: We both went, my younger sister. My older sister went with my mother. Q: So when you got off the train you were Œ A: We were all together on the train, on the Œ Q: But when you got off the train.

My father was a little afraid too but he told me not to tell mommy anything because she shouldn™t, she shouldn™t be a shock. Happened, what happened. That night on the, on the way we didn™t get shoes. We just got something. They took away everything we had and they cut off the hair and we waited there. They put some sanitizer on top of the, I didn™t recognize my sister. S he looked different without hair. So but we were standing there by the big window and we saw outside lined up th e men and we were only girls here on this side. So and I heard them singing . I fell down (shouting?) but what can you do. You can™t do anythi ng. We came to this lager . The first night they didn™t send us to the right place. And another lady well Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 50 like lying down ( lies backward ) and top of you was another person.

To drink coffee so some girls went and that night that was already, we were already a few weeks in. Maybe six weeks in Auschwitz. Q: And the diamonds were always in your mouth? A: One I lost right away. The first night, but one I saved ( gestures both sides of jaw ). The better one I lost but this one I saved and when we got to that room I was afraid to drink or eat anything. I didn™t realize that I lost this one so the diamond I, there was a girl. She came to the, to the same place where we had the bunk beds. And she knew how to , so I was very scared. I was watching them so much because my brothers gave it away in Bergen Belsen for food. So they could get something. And we didn™t know but after the war we met them. So and after, after we drank coffee 2:00 at nig ht we ha d to stand outside lined up in fil e. And it was alrea dy cold in Poland without shoes. Some girls got like Dutch wooden shoes. So I put the foot a little on the back of the foot. I shouldn™t stand on the ground so much.

So we went, I was sick and I pinched my sister she should look healthy. And I was scared too. If you didn™t look healthy they wouldn™t send you to work. And we were happy to get out. And my friend w as so friendly. We stayed all the time til the end of the war together. She knew how to sew.

The French told us there™s mines on the road and they wanted to send us to test the mines before the Russians came. They wanted to try and test if the mines are working. So they wanted to send us as -- Q: As mind blowers up and if you blow up well that™s too bad. Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 61 A: Well it wasn™t a big t hing. Jewish children who are,. How do you know God leads the world, not the people. Even the big people don™t lead the world. That™s we, that™s people that believe, believe that God leads the world. Q: Did you pray when you were in Auschwitz? A: Yeah we prayed by heart what we knew how to pray. We didn™t have books. Q: Did you have any conversations with God? Did you ask why is this happening? A: While we were bitter , we were very b itter , even after the war. Why did it have to happen. Those children never sinned. They were little kids. They never did anything. Q: Some people lost th eir faith beca use of that. A: Yeah we lost for a while, we weren™t so religious. For a while. Q: What did it take for you to get it back? A: We saw that the folks, that God took care of us. We were like lost sheep. We didn™t have where to go. We did not, even when the war ended. What choice was it. We thought that if the war w ould end everybody would come and try to help us. There wa s nobody to help. No there, I wouldn™t say the Czech government wasn™ t there . They gave us money to go home. And when Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 62 the war was over, the French came in. They sang the Marseilles and they said the war is over. And where did we have to go? We didn™t have (both talking) Q: So i t wasn™t the Russians who liberated you? It was the French. A: The Russians but they were drunken. You know they came from Afghanistan, Kavkaz , they were Russian, very wild, drunken soldiers. It was scary. It was very scary. Q: Were you frightened of those soldiers? A: Yes, yes. There was o ne major that came from Minsk, from a big city. And he said I am Jewish. And try to get out of the way because they™re not out for any good. Because they were drunk and they wanted to have a good time. What were they interested in? Q: Did that happen with many Jewish girls? A: Yeah one girl ran away. She was very tall. Then we ran away from that place where we stayed in that factory beca use the Russians came in and to them, you know they are on the way. They wanted to have a good time. And we were very scared so we found a house. It™s the Germans left, just like we left because they ran away too from the Russians. So we were hiding there. And then once the Russians came too and he picked the tallest girl. And it was already night and we didn™t know. And so she ran to a place where little rabbits hide. And she was very tall. She said she does not how she do it. He was drunk. She ran away and she, all night she Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 63 stayed in this place in the rabbit place. And in the morning when it was light she saw he isn™t there anymore . She came back to the house. And then we got scared to stay there too. So we went to Prague. And the authorities. I don™t know what the stories, I can™t even remember. Some girl, we stayed in the pla ce in that factory place where we slept for a while. But then this Russian came and we were scared of them. There was no place where to go what to do. Then we went some, but they told us we could go to trains . They gave trains to Prague. We stayed all night, one night and it was scary for young girls to be any place. You weren™t safe any place. Q: When you got to Prague did you Œ A: In Prague they gave us money and then we went to Poland to go home. So we went to trains. They gave money for the trains and they took care of our papers so I don™t know. Q: Was this the Czech authorities or was this this the Œ A: Jewish. I don™t know if it was only, the Czech were very nice, even the supervisor in the factory, he was also very nice. Q: He was Czech. A: Yes, he spoke German but he was, they behaved different you know. Different people. We weren™t so scared. They were normal kind of people and they couldn™t do anything for us but at least they didn™t scare us. Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 64 Q: Did you make it back to Lodz, did you get back to Lodz? A: We got back to Lodz but I went, we went through, we didn™t have much money. The first little town we got coming over there, the border from Czechoslovakia to Poland, there are some Polish ladies by the station where the first stat ion. And they said so many of you are still alive. We were three girls. Three. I don™t think there were more than three girls. So but then we met somebody told us that our uncle, my mother™s brother is alive and they told us already they went back to look for their family, the two older girls. And they took us for the night to their house. And they were so nice. They called us children. So they got out of their beds and they stayed, slept on the floor and gave me and my sister the beds to sleep and gave us money to go to Pavyanets to see to my uncle. Q: Pavyanets is close to Lodz. A: Yes. Q: And this was an uncle on your mother™s or your fat her™s side. A: On my mother™s side. Q: On your mother™s side. Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 65 A: So he gotten freed in April because he was in a different place. And he got freed in March or April, the Russians came. In before. Then he went home and they also have a bakery so he got his bakery and they had what to eat and they took us in and took us, all the what they call it, children that lost their families, orphans. They took, they were also teenagers. But they took them in and they took us in too. Q: And so you stayed with your uncle. A: For a while and then my aunt was pregnant. She was expecting a baby and we were scared to be in Poland. Because in small towns they killed Jews. Lodz was a bigger city. Was not so dangerous but we were scared and then we found out in the, when you came to Lodz was like a big board and you ( gestures wit h hand over shoulder off camera ) registered. Who is looking for whom. So my brothers registered from Bergen Belsen that they are looking for family. And then they stayed in the younger brother stayed in Germany and my older brother came back and he came back to look for us. So he came to my aunt. But I was sick. I went to some place with my uncle to buy flour and then I got a typhus and I was in the hospital. So when my brother came back he couldn™t see me, only through the window because Œ Q: You were quarantined. A: Yes. Yes, I was under. Q: And your sister was there? Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 66 A: My sister was in the house and I was in the hospital. Q: At that point did you still have your diamond? A: Yes. Q: You still had it. A: Yeah and then when we both, when we all got to Germany to Berlin, my aunt had the baby in December. Q: She also left. Your uncle left with your aunt. A: Yeah, they sold the bakery whatever money they got, we have to pay money to smuggle us and they we were on trains with coal and you paid the people working and they put us between the coal. Q: Why did you need to be smuggled out of Poland? A: We didn™t want to stay there, was dangerous. Q: But why couldn™t you just freely leave and go on a train? Why not? Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 67 A: We couldn™t, you couldn™t because they would n™t let us in. Q: Germany wouldn™t let you in. Or the Poles wouldn™t let you out. A: The Poles might . I don™t know but they took care of it. Then they paid them and we ended up in West Berlin. Q: One of the rea sons why I™m a sking is that I suspect it™s because it was occupied by Soviet forces and they weren™t letting people out. I suspect, but I wanted to find out whether that™s the case. A: Yes, probably the Russians, the Russians wouldn™t let us out becau se was already the city was divided into, into French, English, Russian and American. Q: You™re talking about Berlin A: Berlin, yes. Q: Which section did you arrive into? A: In American. Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 68 Q: Y ou got to the American section? A: We could go to the French but once we had plans to either we go to Israel or to America. There was no other places to go. Q: So it was that your brother came back to Lodz, he found you. A: One brother. Then we went back to pick up my other brother. He was in Germany and then we stayed there. The German, the government, the geminder gave an apartment to my aunt. Was the first Jewish child born in from there, from those people and the Americans gave my uncle a bakery so he baked for the Americans. (b oth talking) Q: This was in Berlin. A: Yeah in Berlin and there was at that point between those orphans was a boy at that point from the city where my uncle lived and two girls, three girls. And my aunt, two girls got married and but that boy stayed in Berlin. I don™t know what happened. One girl went to France. She had an uncle there. And the others, the other one had some family in Israel. So they went and they, we couldn™t go to Israel. They wouldn™t let us. Q: I have a question here. You are four children who survived. Yo ur older brother, your younger brother, your younger sister and you. Did you end up living together again. Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 69 A: Yes. Q: So you didn™t stay with your uncle and your aunt. You just lived separately. A: After a while we lived separately but we lived in, we didn™t go to the DP camps. We lived in the city beca use of my aunt, yeah. At this point we sold the diamond. We were on our own and started doing something. Q: You sold your diamond in Berlin. A: I gave it to my brother. They took care of us. Because the girl s you know it™s different. Q: Did you sister still have a diamond to give to him as well. A: She didn™t have. She lost it. And I lost mine, the second one. Too. But nobody worried about it. That was helpful. Q: It™s what your father would have wanted. It™s exactly why he wanted you to have them. A: And it was a good thing because he would give you anything. It™s good the uncle and aunt took care of us but you know they had already a baby and they took care of the other but th e deaf boy was a little helpless. Because he couldn™t speak. But then some, I don™t™ know. Maybe some, somebody in the geminder took care of him. Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 70 Q: You™re in Berlin and I think you told me what section of the city were you living in? A: In Kreutzberg . Q: In Kreutzberg . How long did you stay there. A: From December 45 til 51. I got married in 1951. Q: Oh so you stayed six years in Berlin. A: Yeah. I w ent to school. I learned languages. I learned to do, to manage the make -up . I don™t™ know. They were from, the HIAS they helped us. (both talking) Too much we could not. And my sister went to a nursing school. She finished high school and she went to a nurse but she was younger than me. And then she wanted to go to medical school but then I got married and we got permits to go to America so Œ Q: How did you meet your husband? A: In Berlin I met him. Q: How? Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 71 A: Through friends. Q: How did he get there? How did he leave the Soviet Union? A: Yes, he was, Soviet Union. He came, they came home to Poland with his mother and the brother was sick. He had TB on, TB so he went to place. My husband worked very hard to get him to Switzerland. They had a sanatorium there. So he healed. Q: Did he? He got better? A: Yes and my husband had already a heart condition. I didn™t know but somehow he lived but gave us four children and he took care of us. That™s why I believe in God because we see it that we were very helpless and who helped us. Q: Is there something e lse you would like to add to your story for today. You™ve talked about an awful lot and it™s only, in a few hours you can never get the full story of a person. But here we™re close to the end and I wanted to ask, is there something else you would want people to know what you™ve gone through, what you experienced and how you came out of it. A: The only way I could explain that God took care of us because we by ourselves we had no way to go to Israel because the children transports weren™t allowed to go in the time when we, we didn™t™ have where to go and we didn™t know what to do. And somehow God showed us a way. We didn™t do it by our self. So I, whatever happens to us it™s not that we™re so smart, that Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 72 one is smarter than the next one, some people are sma rt. And it™s not meant for them to have anything. And they struggle. Some people get very rich and some people are not so rich and they have to make the best with what they have. But the main thing in my life is whether I did anything good that I helped somebody when he needed me. And whenever I could, I was able to. I™m not sorry. I™m only sorry that I maybe didn™t do enough. What we tried to do and we could. Q: Did you tell your children about your experiences during the war. Did you share Œ A: No, not when they were young. Now I did. Now when they were, when they understood already, I did. My husband spoke more about it, what he went through. And he was but he injected the belief and he showed me many times in life I thought it™s not going to work. It™s not going to be good. My husband was sick and I was pregnant with my third child. I didn™t know that from the beginning he struggled plenty too. But everybody does. So he told me and he said but you said he had a small heart attack. He was in besert so he said to me don™t be scared. You see God takes care of us. And if God will want me to live, I will live and don™t worry. God provides for everything. And he injected into the children the belief and trust in God. And we, the truth and it™s a true thing that he could only trust in God because he takes care of us. Because ourselves, we think we™re smart. We can do. It™s not what happened that night a friend of his went to a wedding and he passed across the street to the subway to get the subway from East Broadway and a motorcycle came and on the spot he was dead. So he said there is no insurance in life for anything. If you are supposed to live and you have to live, God helps you. But if you are supposed to die in one minute, you are dead. So the n I said whatever it was, we managed Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 73 and life it™s what you want from life. You™re not here just for our pleasure. We have to be here for other people and whenever we had a friend or my son went to school away to Switzerland and a man came. He was also a Holocaust survivor without a hand. And the principal directed him to our house. It was holiday. So he came. He wasn™t an easy person with one hand and my younger daughter had to take him across the subway. He was scared but my husband said he is a guest. You have to treat him better than yourself. And if he needs your bed, you give your bed to him. So he injected it into the children too. And thanks to him we have good children. Q: I think not only thanks to him but probably also thanks to you. A: Yeah but yes, I did too. And whenever he brought somebody home, I never said, I always took him with a smiling face and made them feel good. I guess I got it a little from home too. Q: Thank you so much. I have appreciated that you took the time to share your story with us. A: Yeah but I appreciate you. You™re such a wonderful person. There isn™t many like you and I really admire you as a person. I didn™t know you but I wish you all the best. They claim to say that Holocaust survivors have the power to bless people because they went through, that™s what the rabbis say because they like. Q: Thank you very much. Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 74 A: I wish you a happy long happy and good life and you should have joy that life should bring to you. Q: It™s a real gift thank you. I will say with that , that this concludes our interview, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mrs. Marcia Loewi on January 8, 2016 in Borough Park, New York. A: Thank you. It™s a pleasure. I learned from you a lot. Because there isn™t many people like you. But thank God there is people. Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 75 (file 2 Œ RG-50.030.0870.02.02 Œ audio; duration: 22:11) Ina Navazelskis: this is United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mrs. Marcia Loewi on March 6, 2016 and this is in addition to the interview that we conducted with Marcia Loewi earlier this year in January and should be considered as one interview. In this addition, Mrs. Loewi would like to add some information that she forgot to mention during our first inter view. So now I am going to turn it over to you Mrs. Loewi. Tell me about these points, these things, these experiences that you wanted us to record and give me a little bit of context of what happened. Marcia Loewi: I worked in that, in a small furnitur e company and one day we came to work and the night shift, the night. Q: This was in the Lodz ghetto already? A: Yes , yes, and the night shift, how do you say it. Q: The night shift is perfectly fine. A: The night shift people were sitting and crying. We came in like 8:00 and so and there was you know like blood in the street. There was a hospital for mentally ill next and there was next to our factory so at night the Germans came and evacuated the hospital. There were children. They came with trucks an d they threw down the children like objects with their heads down. Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 76 Q: From the windows. A: From the windows of the hospital. It was called the Visola street hospital. It™s for mental ill and they said what they saw happened. Animals, animals wouldn™t act like this. In essential and people that were not capable. And they had mental illnesses and that™s affected us very badly because what is a human being. You take and throw it down with their heads. You, so you break the heads and scalps of innocent little children. That were born with defects. Q: Were these, did anybody have family members perhaps who had been in that hospital. Did you know of anybody who had a dear one or a relative Œ A: You see I was a teenager in those times. I was maybe 15, 16. So I, we didn™t, I wasn™t connected to a different area than we lived. We lived on the other side of the bridge out from the here in the center of the city. Was a, like a round thing and there was a pomnik , how do you say. Q: A statue. A: A statue. There was a statue and from this round circle went different streets. This way, this way and out there. That™s how the city was running. And we lived on this side of the city and it went down to the lower streets, to the Œ Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 77 Q: Outside the ghetto when you had Œ A: Outside the ghetto. No I don™t, I didn™t know people that and the factory was you had to go over a bridge to the other side of the road and the middle was barbed wire. And there a bridge that was there that you shouldn™t have to go through th e traffic. It was like a highway. Q: And was it one part of the ghetto connected to another part of the ghetto. A: Part of the ghetto yes, but I think this bridge probably was built before the war because it was a big bridge. You went up steps and ther e was a walk. Q: What was the name of the hospital. Do you remember. A: Visola . Q: Visola and had it been a hospital before the war. A: I™m sure. I don™t™ know but I™m sure they didn™t build hospitals during the war. Q: No, but a building could be taken over and made into a hospital. A: I think it was famous, that™s how they called it Visola hospital and our factory was on beside, so it was like one next to the other and there was also a cemetery in back of our factory. Was a Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 78 big cemetery . Sometimes we used to go there in recess time. So we walked and we talked you know but I didn™t™ have connection with the people. We just heard it and it was a terrifying thing. The way they explained like they threw down the kids like with their heads down. Q: Do you know was this also Polish children as well as Jewish children or do you think it was Œ A: No it was part of the ghetto. So I don™t think that the Polish children was in it. About the hospital yes. Yeah I don™t think they were only children that probably couldn™t stay home and they needed the attention of a medical attention. Q: Well you know the Germans had this euthanasia program with in Germany itself for Jews and non-Jews but Œ A: The ghetto was separate. The peo ple from the cit y, the Jewish people there, they evacuated and took off everything , the stores. There was a lot, it was a big city of 600,000 population and 300,000 were Jewish. There were a lot of hospitals, big hospitals. That rich Jews donated to build the hospitals. There were three big hospitals . There was a very rich man they call Kozna nsky . And this Kozna nsky built two hospitals in different areas of the city. Q: And all of that was taken over and stolen basically. A: Taken over and then, everything they pushed out. And you see people are mean to them because when we were in the ghetto, we were before the war, my parents built up. They were Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 79 wealthy. We had nine children, but if God wants he gives you, he gives you to make a living. You could work and work and nothing happens but if it™s God™s will whatever you touch goes. So my parents had a beautiful home right before the war. One thing I am, I feel my father went to a rabbi. Q: I™m going to pause just for a second. It™s very important. A: It™s jus t that everybody was so shattered by what happened you couldn™t™ imagine that people did things to innocent sick children. Like this to children. Q: Not to see them as worthy of any kind of consideration or dignity or anything. A: So and then , you see this picture. We had in our bedroom, my parents™ bedroom. Q: This particular Œ A: Not this picture. Was a picture there was once a court and King Solo mon was a very smart man and he, there were two mothers and one, one the mothers had a fight. Who™s the, one child was missing from the hospital or from whatever. And each one claimed it™s their child, it™s her child. So the king said of the child and you see from the picture we going to cut the baby in two and you get half the baby and you get half the baby. So he wanted to see the reaction. And one of the mothers went how they said, give her the baby, don™t cut the baby. So he said you are the mother and she got the baby. Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 80 Q: I remember that story. A: You remember that story and we had the picture in our bedroom. And this was left and I don™t™ know but my mother said she ordered it. Took a couple years to paint it. cause there™s a lot of detail on it. And that expression on the faces was very good. You know the way and their mother was running, don™t, don™t™ do it. Stop it. Q: Don™t hurt the baby. A: Yeah you heard us talking. We had this painting. Q: You had it at your home in Lodz. And did you lose that painting when you lost everything else. A: I don™t think we lost. We came back. there was nothing ours. Nothing was belonging to us anymore . Somebody lived in our apartment but he hardly let us in. Q: Really. A: And they were neighbors before. They lived on the fourth floor and we lived on the third floor. They went, that nasty but t hey just weren™t very happy that we came. Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 81 Q: But they had taken over your apartment. A: You see the expensive furniture that we have, they took to the ghetto. There were like two, they had a place for horses for cattle. So they, the people that lived the re they had friends of my cousin. He had a store that was selling wheat and food for horses and animals. So he exchanged the houses. So we took the expensive dining room set, we took it to the ghetto. But once somebody was showing, if somebody showed who was rich Jews and who has who might have money, then they came to the house and they looked in the whole house. The children were standing. And my father told us don™t look the direction where I have some, the older children. The younger didn™t know. So w e had like medicine cabinet. In that medicine cabinet my father because somebody denunciated that were rich. So he said don™t look in the direction where I have something because they look in the places and then they follow where everybody is nervous abo ut so there was in the bathroom was the medication we had some diamonds. Because my father when he gave up the business for the first year they needed a textile factory to make uniforms and they paid for it something. And my father had the raw material. Not finished textile. So they paid something for it and let him stay in the city for a while. Q: This search was still in your original home, not in the ghetto. When he says don™t look in the -- A: It was in the ghetto. Q: It was already in the ghett o. Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 82 A: Because the Ripo , Criminal Politsar went to look for rich Jews. Ripo Criminal Politsar so my father said he had two rooms, how much did we have in the ghetto. We had two rooms, we™re nine children and the kitchen. Q: And they didn™t find the diamonds. A: No we tried to look how to win them but they took away the expensive dining room set. Was gorgeous. You don™t see it really. Q: Who knows where it™s ended up. A: They took it and then, and then they called my father once to the Ripo . They beat him up and said what we have we should give. So he saw that dining room was in the office over there where they took him in. They took it out from the ghetto, from the warehouse and they took it. It was beautiful, unusual. It was like African wood and the mahogany veneer was laid out like lion™s heads and because that African wood has like a Sara: a pattern like a zebra. Like I have on my Q: This is Sara your daughter saying that Sara: Like that™s on my vanity like crouch mahogany you™re talking about or like zebra wood. Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 83 A: It was you see this is a copy. I bought the door that we had. It™s deep dark mahogany. It was gorgeous. Sara: like Crouch mahogany, like clay mahogany. A: And the doors were lined with marble, was like a winery where you kept the bottles of wine liquor and it opened this way. Like on hinges. It came apart when you opened it. Sara: is that the wine rack like the wine cellar. A: No, like you see sometimes you have hinges you pull out. Q: You can see that becomes like a surface. A: It comes like a table. Q: Let™s finish up with that point then. So your father then is sees this dining room set at the Ripo headquarters. A: Because they came once to the house and they looked all over and they found it there. Pro bably people, they told them about it. They probably paid them some to say who the rich people were, people who had where they could take things. People were jealous too you know. Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 84 Sara: What about painting. A: The painting stayed in the house. I don™t think we had work taken, but they took it away because it was a historical painting. And there was even wider than this because Œ Q: And this one, if we look at your painting here it is a painting of animals and landscape. A: Now this my husband picked up here at an auction for $20 when we came to America. He had my, he imported like antique, you see like this Bloom vase I have here. We were importers , we imported and sold antiques. You see I have here a Meissen vase and a ll this. It was mostly for business but he didn™t sell it so I have it. We didn™t go out to buy these things. We had more imported but we couldn™t sell it because the Americans didn™t like to buy silver and all this. We had to give it away. We needed money. So it was, this is not so important but the dining room set was nine, several thousand dollars they paid my parents. That was a piece of art. The table. Sara: The 1930s, a few thousand dollars is like today like 50,000 Q: It™s a lot, it™s a lot a nd it shows Œ A: And it was very unusual, very beautiful. But this they took away. We took it to the ghetto as out of the house. Now so they looked all over and he took it away and when they took my father and they beat him up, he should say what he has to give, where he has his money so he saw it Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 85 later on in the Ripo house there. Where they take the people for investigation. People were jealous to him. People are mean, people are jealous, was hungry, but you couldn™t™ eat the furniture. Q: Was there anything else. Hang on just a second. Let™s take a look here. A: The hospital that I thought was important. Q: It™s very important. Is there any other point that you had wanted to bring up here. A: No, the little kids like five, six, seven year old kids worked in the straw factory. They were what. Weavers of straw. They made Q: What did they make from the straw. A: Baskets. Baskets. I don™t™ know because they little kids, they used the kids because whatever they could they did. They didn™t pay anything for it. You see like probably we got soap and we got a piece of bread, this size like for a day. Q: So that would be something like 4 inches by 2 inches. Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 86 A: Yeah, this way, this way. You cut the bread and we had to buy it, loaves and it was so heavy because they left it wet. It should weigh more. So the people that, the bakers could take a little flour. It™s still in the oven, much of the same. Q: I™m going to pause for a minute. I™ve turned the machine on again and I just want to be able to ask if there was anything else you wanted to add to your interview or any final thoughts that you have about what we were talking now or the other time when I was here. A: You should learn something from mistakes of people before. We shouldn™t re peat the same thing because this wouldn™t™ bring any, the world no place Sara: Anti -Semitism and (both talking) A: not only anti -Semitism Sara: discrimination for any A: Any people. Sara: Discrimination is a bad thing for A: For any peo ple. Interview with Marcia Lo ewi 87 Sara: And again my thing is that we should have America should be you know give us the merit and the good, continue saying that living well is the best revenge. Q: ok so we have heard now also from Sara Loewi as well as Marcia Loewi and with that Mrs. Mar cia Loewi I thank you very, very much. A: Thank you for all your work you put in. You really build up an example for the world. Q: In the name of the museum we are very grateful to hear that and so this concludes the addition to the United States Holoca ust Memorial Museum with Mrs. Marcia Loewi on March 6, 2016 in Brooklyn New York.
