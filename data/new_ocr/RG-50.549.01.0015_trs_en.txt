And most of my family left, only not my uncle. One uncle. My father didn't want to leave my grandfather, so we didn't go away. But th at man would, create, what 's the Englis h, squeeze... Q: Squeal? A: Squeal, he would squeal on Jews and at the end he finished in a camp anyway, but he squeals a lot on Jews . Not on my father, my family, because his wife used to work for us. So, he came to my father, he say, "I won't squeal on you". Q: What did your neighborhood look like? Did it look different? Did, how was it different? A: The neighborhood was not Jewish, there was only a man on the fourth floor, it was four floor __________, and he was __________ Americ an and he told my parents to go away from the house. That was after two months, I left the house to be hidden. And that woma n had two daughters who we re, excuse me, whores. And she came down and she said to my father, "Look, I owe you. I'm __________, it's nothing or nothing, I don't have the money to pay you and I squealed. And I'm sorry I squealed, so I want you to go away because Jews there, at 8:00 they're going to come to take you". So my father say, "You, my friend , my wife just made you a cake, I don't believe it. I don't believe it". And, be lieve it or not, 8:00 Tuesday they came and my brother, who didn't want to leave t he house, that the neighbor wanted to take him in and put him under the bed, and he didn't want, so he closed himself in the toilet, and they broke the toilet, they took him along.

A: I was a very nerv ous child at the time. And my br other didn't want to leave and as my friend said, "I have an aunt who lives out of town and she will take care and why don't you let her th ere?" So they decided , and I'll never forget, I went by train, my father took me by the, to the train, and in Belgium, in Antwerp, if a German walked in the street and y ou were Jew, you should walk in the middle of the street, not on the sidewalk where the German. My father must have been excited that he leaves me, who knows if he'll see me again, he didn't know, it would be so bad, we walked on the street, a German came, stopped and gave him two beatings on the face. And I had a very big respect for my father and I started to cry and shout because who would slap my father? I never saw it, I never heard of it __________. That's it. He had a store fi rst, but he went with me to the station to take the train I should go to the people wh o were hidden, hiding me. Q: __________. A: Nothing, you wouldn't da re to say something because my best friend that I tell you, her mother had a stor e and one day I met, there we re German coming into her and what kind of friendship she had with him. And he liked me because he had a child the same age as mine and he liked me very much, he wanted only to give me a kiss or a hug and I didn't want. So, o ne day I wore my David Star and I went in the street with my mother and I walked ac ross the street, I saw the German. He didn't know I'm Jewish. So I run in the first store, my mother didn't understand the reason. So the second day he came to my friend's mother and he said, "I could have given any amount of money that I saw that little An ny, but it was a Jewish girl, it's not Anny, but she just look like her". He saw me but he, he couldn't believe it was me because I'm not Jewish, he didn't understand. I didn't know what he would have done if he would know, but he was sure it was me. And it was me. But I disappeared, I was very fas t, I disappeared when I saw his face. All that I had in mind is go, go. That's what I did. Q: So you're describing already some new rules. You ha d to wear a star. A: Yeah. Q: Of David. If you saw a German coming, you had to get out of the street. A: Yeah. Q: What were some of the other rules? A: The rules that children couldn't go in the regular school. Ch ildren couldn't go in the library. Couldn't go to any doctor they wanted, only to certain doctors. There was a lot of things you couldn't do, a lot of things. Q: And how did your pare nts explain it to you? A: They sat down and they told us that because we Jewish, they look, not Jews like we, Jews that are the third generation they check. And th ey explained to us and that's it. And I always said I could write a book, lo t of stories because I went through, during the hiding, a lo t that I didn't even say my tape. An d that's it. And now I don't get a penny from th e Germans, I do n't get a penny. Q: __________ explore that, not righ t now, but when we do the whole __________. So how soon af ter the Germans, do you remember hearing that the Germans had invaded? Do you remember that moment? A: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Q: What was that like? A: That was the 10 of May, 1940, they invaded Belgium. And as I told you before, the Belgian Jews didn't know how bad it is , we ran away. And then when we came back, they said that the Jews from Belg ium, born in Belgium, would not be taken away, the Queen announced. And my aunt was born in Belgium and she didn't hide or nothing. But my unc le was sitting there and he lived three days, everything closed, they took them away and he was left because he was hiding. Had a child one and a half and six years old. Then after three days when he came down, they were gone. And he was closed in the apartment, in the house, it was a house. Q: But, so, the scenario is this, that the Germans invaded, many, many Jews left. After a few days they came back and they found these new rules. How long did you live like that before your parents decided it was not safe? A: Two years. Two years. It started and started and people would go away and go away, and my parents wouldn 't leave my grandfather a nd that's the reason we stayed and that's the reason they were taken away. An d my grandfat her was taken away and then he was 78. My grandmother was taken to a hospital where she lived during the war. But my father was a very good son, as you can understand. From all the five sons , he was the only one who didn't want to leave. That's it. Q: Did that cause arguments between your mother and your father? Did your mother want to leave? A: I don't think so because she let him decide and she di d what he wanted. That's it. Q: Did you ever talk about it with your older brother, you and your brother might be sitting together? A: Maybe not much, he took me much youn ger than I was and fe lt he's older, he shouldn't tell me, he shouldn't talk about it. But, that's all what I remember, maybe yes, but I don't __________ spoke a lot. We didn't talk. Q: Did your father ever try to explain it to you? A: No, he explained to me that I'll be a short whil e by these people, then they'll come and pick me up to be home. Q: So, let's talk about this. Was there any one thing that made your parents decide that you should go into hiding? A: Yes, they said that a lot of my friends were taken away. My best friend, she was a little older, she said, "Oh, I am so happy to go away, I'll be able to put blue on my eyes and lipstick". And she didn't know where and what she's going. And my parents said we want you to be somewher e we know where you are. We don't want you to go with her or what. Because I wanted to go with that friend because we were very close, a Jewish girl. S he never came back. She never came back. Q: So a lot of families were beginning to send their children away? A: Yeah, yeah. Q: But there wasn't, I mean, one thing? One day this happened and the next day you went into hiding? A: No, no. No, no. Q: Tell us about your friend, Raphael, who beca me, you assumed her identity. A: Yes. Q: Just tell us, imagine that we don't know anything about it. A: She was very good, she was an only daughter, s he liked me and when I was hiding, she went to my aunt, that I told you was Belgian, she went to bring her food. She went to my grandfather, she went to my parents while they were staying in Belgium, and she was extremel y good. She would put on a Star of David and go in the Jewish neighborhood, s he had black hair so she look ed Jewish, so everybody took her for a Jew, but sh e could have been arrested and taken away because she wore the David Star and the Da vid Star here. So, but she said in her mind, "I want to help". She re ally was helping and doing most she could. Raphael __________. There's a little French there. And that's it. So my uncle, wh en he was taken away, lived with nuns in a convent where ther e was 50, 40 nuns, nob ody knew he is a man, nobody knew he is Jewish, only the Mother Superior, the Superior Mother. The Mother in charge from the whole nuns there. She knew that he's a man and he's Jewish. But the nuns didn't know and as he had black hair and a beard, he shaved four to five times a day, he wore the clot hes as a nun. Q: He was a nun, he pretended to be a woman. A: Yeah, as a woman and a nun. So four or five ti mes a day he would shave and eat only kosher. Q: What was his name? A: Israel Livingston. Q: How did he get into the monastery? A: The woman who used to work for him, the maid, the housekeeper, she knew that monastery, she talked to them an d when he was closed in the house, she went through the roof and went into the house and put him on clothe s from her husband who died. Gave him the identity card of her hu sband that didn't look at all like him. And she took him by train to the monastery in Brussels. So she put her life at stake, too. And they went to Brussels and the Mo ther Superior knew about him and that's it. And he stayed there a year. A full year in the monastery. Dressed and lived like a nun, five times a day he shaved. Q: And he did this after th e Nazis had searched the ho me and taken his wife and children away? So he knew he was in danger? A: No, he didn't know that same night, that Friday night, they were religious people, they didn't know they coming for him. Th ey thought they coming for them, not for him, they coming for him, not for them. So they said all the time, stay where you are, like hysteric. He was upstairs on the third floor. They were downstairs. When they opened the door, they thought somebody squealed on him and they looking for him. Like they looked for me a few times when I wa s hidden. But it was not true. They looked fo r them and not for him, they didn' t know he is in the building. So they took away all the family. And when they saw good furn iture or good things, they would close from outside to inside the house, nobody should go in. So they seal the house til th ey take out a family. So they sealed it and he was inside. Q: Let's go back to, do you remember yo ur mother talking to you before, the day before you went away or t he night? What did she say? A: She would say, "Look, we have to send you away. It's for your own good, we hope to be together soon". So we thought so. And af ter the war, we prepared 12 bedrooms, full bedrooms, and nobody came back. Twenty-eight from the family were taken. Close, you k now, father's family, close, aunts and uncles and cousins. Very close, 28, were taken away. Q: What did you take with yo u when you went into hiding? A: Maybe three dresses, two dresses, because I used to go to church every Sunday, they made me go. Because the people in the neighborhood, they __________ I'm a niece from out of town. And that dress I would wear Sunday, then nothing, a skirt and a to p, maybe. Nothing special. My socks were all hard from mending, not like now, they mended the socks. I would need the socks, wear them. And they got money for me every month. And once my parents were taken, they were worried. The money will stop. I don't think they would give me up or what, they wanted to adopt me after the war because they had a sick girl, retarded, they wanted to adop t me and my uncle didn't want me to become Catholic. And they had respect for me, there was never pork in the house while I lived there. But, they were very strict to me, very strict. If I break an egg, I wouldn't get an egg for three days. And the food was not too much. When I had once an accident, they wouldn't call a doctor because they were afraid. So, it was not easy when you're very spoiled from home, because I was very spoiled as an only daughter. And that's it. Q: Did you take anything from home like a doll or photographs? A: No, only the diary, only th e diary, no jewelry. Only the diary, and now I'm more in touch than all these years was a cousin of mine that went last week to the Holocaust Museum and I got a ticket and she... [end of side A of tape one of three] Q: You were talking about your cousin. A: And now we got in touch very much and we're very cl ose again. We were very close as children. And she started to call here and I ca me now and I said, "I want to give you that page from the diary, if I find my diar y". Then I started to looking. One day I'll give it to you, make you a copy. But she painted me a sheep and she say, "Our love is forever". It was the last thing I saw her for many, many years, maybe 30, 40 years I didn't see, didn't hear. Now she lives in Houston, Texas. But in the war, no, she was in Ecuador, she wa sn't in Belgium. She didn't go through anything. And when we met a week ago or two, she didn't believe that I don't get money from the Nazi war because we went through so much, we said, "Ours was our daughters". And I told them , I don't know if I said it in my tape, I don't think, how they look to me and so on during the war, they were sitting and crying. But I went through __________ losing my husband that I can't cry. It's not good, it's healthier when you cry. But I cried a lot after the wa r and then later I can't. It's inside, you see, some people cry fast, but I can't. I just can't cry so fast. Q: Who gave you the diary? It was your already? A: I kept it all the time in the war. And then when I mo ved from Israel here to get married, I got married. Q: No, but I mean, how, when did you start it? A: I started in Belgium, my pa rents gave it to me, like diary with a little mirror. And I started to write, to give it to my friends, and they all si gned, most are not there. You know, children. And then, at the end, in the diary, if yo u see, it's written about my parents, my cousin who was taken away and how I feel an d how I, and it was very sensitive. But then when I made the tea, I say, "If you want I gi ve you that copy". So they say, "No, I want the original". So I ga ve the original. Q: Describe arriving at your new home, where was it and how, what kind of room did you have when you were in hiding? When you were s ent away to a family of your best friend? A: It was a bad feeling. It was a feeling like lost because I always had my parents near me and I was spoiled a nd loved and cherished. But th ey tried to be very nice, the man was very, very intelligent and he wanted me only to study, study, gave me private lesson in German. And then he put me by the nuns to study, studied English and French lite rature. He wanted me only to study. And by the way, last week I wrote a letter to Ellie(ph) Vazel(ph) about somebody and I wrote about me and he wanted me only to stud y and know more because he knew a lot. And they had a retarded child, as I to ld you and the marriage was no t very successful. And I was very naive because when the army came, the English army, we had an Englishman living there, started a little, st arted with his wife, but I didn't know because they brought me up, I was at the age 15, 16, like a little girl of seven, eight. He wanted me only to study, only to study. And I must be thankful to him, the languages, what I know now, is all thanks to him becau se he insisted I should study. Q: What were their names? A: Collette and Henri, French names. And the family name was very French, Gramoulet(ph). Big, __________, like in Holland and Belgium, __________. Q: __________ A: Yeah, Gramoulet, big windmill, transla te word by word, bu t that's a name, a family name. Q: So did you speak French with them? A: Yeah, only French. Q: What did the house look like? A: Oh, they had a bea utiful home. Beautiful garden. But a lot of shooting during the war because it was near a train station and they said to the neighbors that I was a little sick and I cannot stay in a big city, so they, it was around 50 miles from Brussels. They, I cannot stay in the city with my parents, I have to have fresh air of the suburbs, that's the reason they took me. And they want me to stay with them. But I had a lot of, lot of accidents. That being the first and the wo rst accident was that I went to a man who ga ve me an identity card. You need cards for food and identity. And I saw that big truck with people from the German and I couldn't hide and I couldn't run away. But inside the truck was a boy who knew me from Belgium, from Antwerp. And his par ents wanted him to stay, __________ they didn't know him and they didn 't want, so he said to somebody in the wagon that I am Jewish, not Catholic. So they looked at me, but I had disappeared. I wasn't there, so the German looked fo r me after that in every house they came, there was maybe in the street, five like houses, villas they called it. And they looked but they couldn't find me because it took five minutes to st retch between the tennis, you and I play tennis, there is the, you know, what's in between us, the net, that's between us, goes like that, so when you turn it that was like steps and I took it up on the attic, I took it up. Q: Wait. You crawled up a net? A: No, the net, we used to take the net and put it here a nd that is the attic, I would go up. Q: You would make sort of a stairs. A: Yeah. I would go up the kind of stairs , take up the net, close the door and that was the attic, you could not put a ladder, you could not put a chair and go up, you couldn't reach, only with that net. Q: You sort of climbed up a rope net? __________ A: You did it. And closed the door. I was small, but stayed there three hours. When I came back, I was half fainted because it was a chimney, like a chimney, you know, for the coal and so I was half fainted when they took me out from there. They looked thre e-quarter of an hour in the house. Q: And what did that sound like when they were looking for you? A: At the same moment it wa s like, just I'm going to faint, that I felt like I'm going any minute to faint because it was hot from the coal and it was hot from that going up in a rush. It's not that you take it easy , you go slowly, I had to make it in two minutes, go up, take the net, cl ose the door from inside, it was all, and do n't forget, I was very childish. It's not that you're grown up and you know what you do, why, what, when. But at the same moment you do it because yo u feel you want to live. You want to stay alive. And the second day... Q: Let's stay with this just for a second, though. So are you standing up... A: No, laying, laying. Q: Laying down. And what can you hear? A: I can hear not good bec ause the door is closed, but I ca n hear a little . A little. Like screaming saying, "To hell with it, where is she? Isn't she here?" "No". But I have a feeling she's here. "Is she here?" "No". And it would go on and go on for half an hour. And you would stand just here and I am just on top of you. So any minute I thought you'll find out, but you had no way. If you're smaller, you had no way to come up, because it was too na rrow and too small an d you couldn't come up. And then the second day fr om that, they didn't give up on me. They say they know that they have a Jewess at __________. So it went so fast. Q: So the Germans said that they were sure... A: Sure there was some __________ hiding a Jew. So they came unexpected, I didn't have the time to go up, so they put me in the gard en and then like buried me. They put earth on me and I was there. Th e same time, the next day. Q: Oh, the next day. Who took you in the garden? A: My aunt, my aunt. They digged a hole, th ey put me in, they covered the hole and they were looking in the garden, but there was no sign, there was nothing, you understand? Because there was no sign that ther e was somebody, there was plants and there was po tatoes or something. Q: Did you resist being buried? A: I don't know, I remember that I was sick for two days after that, I was staying in bed and I was crying all the ti me. Because I didn' t know why they did it to me. She say, "It's for your own good". She was very , very nice, very st ingy, I remember, but very nice. Very warm person, but stingy, very stingy . That was all in one week. The attic, __________, and the third day, it was not finished. I was supposed to go to the man who gave me the identity card. And it was not like from here to the corner, it was not far and he had to change something on my identity card, it was in Raphael's name. So he, he saw I am yo ung and he take advantage, he say, "I insist, you should tell me that 's your real name". It's not my real name. I say, "It's my real name". __________ I wasn't so stupid. And he insisted, I wouldn't tell. So then he say, you know, "Leave me your identity card here. Next Monday, I'll give it to you". And I had a feeling, sixth sense, not to give him, I say, "I'll give it to you Sunday". I came home and I cried, I say, "He want ed that card". She says, "You didn't give it to him?" I say, "No, I had a feeling not to". Sh e say, "My child, do whatever you feel". The next morning she came to me and she hugged me, she say, "You know, they killed him". He was on his way somewhere and he had identity cards, 25 or 30, and all these people were taken away. You didn't know if he worked for the Germans and for the American, for both. Q: __________ double? A: Double. So they neve r knew who killed him. Bu t the people were all taken away. She was very, very hap py that I didn't give him the card because there was the address and the name and the age, everything on the identity card . So she was very happy. Q: I want to go back to, I mean, how little were you? How quickly could you dig a hole for you? A: I didn't dig it. They digged it maybe two or three days in advance in case they needed it. They prepared . I didn't dig it. Not I knew, not I would. No, I didn't dig that hole. Q: Did you close your eyes? Did they put a blanket over you? A: Nothing, nothing. Just plain, yeah. Just alive. Q: And how long we re you underground? A: Maybe half an hour she to ld me. But it was like a year. But it was only a half a year, a half an hour, that's all. No, and I could never hav e a doctor like one time I made soap and I burned all my hands, here I have signs and they would not call a doctor. All that boiling water and soap, we didn't have soap, so we made soap ourselves, they couldn 't call the doctor because they were afraid. The only thing is, I went Sunday to church and that's all. For now. She used to say, "You pray for your God. I know you don't pray, but you pray for your God". I say, "Not supposed to pray for your God in a church". I said, "You have to go to a synagogue, you cannot pray in a church". She say, "You can". Q: Do you think that's true? A: I don't think you can pray in a ch urch for a synagogue, I don't think so. Q: Who, when you say like af ter you were buried alive, that you cried for two days, who comforted you? Or did anyone touch you or __________. A: They comforted me, but not like a mother. Not like a mother. I don't know how you feel with your mother, but it was missing because it was not the comfort of a mother. But they tried to ca lm me down, make me calm. But, it was not too strong, the comfort. Maybe at that time, at t hat moment, going th rough what I went through, I was a little hard and I overcome this. You understand? But, you know. That's what I did. Q: When you were in the hole, with the dirt on top of you, could you hear the Germans looking for you? A: No, but I felt like, go, a certain moment, it was like they go on top of me, but otherwise, I don't know where they are. Bu t when they walk near me, it felt like you walk on my head. Bu t that's all, but I didn't react. Maybe I was too weak or maybe I was mixed up or maybe I was anxious and nervous from what's happening. They would say in advance, I would sa y, "I don't accept, I won't do it". And then I did it because they wanted me to do it. Q: They had warned you that that might happen, and you said, "I don't want to be buried?" A: No, they say, we might have to do that. I say, "I would prefer to go up in the attic". She said to wait and see what situation will be. Then the situation didn't come to go to the attic and they had no other way than to do that. Because if they don't save me, they would be taken away to one because all the __________ of the family, we gave somebody, and the son squealed on the father, they took away his father and all the silv er of the family. So I told her to __________, I read it in the paper what, so she said, "You see, God forbid if they take you, they take us away, too because we wanted to save you. So we also in danger as much as you are". She explained to me, she says, "So, you have to do what we tell you to do because we just in danger like you are". So I decided to do what she tells me. Q: What did you call her? A: Aunt. Q: What was a regular day like? Did you think every day, maybe the Germans will come looking for me? Maybe just describe a regular day. A: I got up in the morning and I was, I was in a very bad mo od because I didn't know what the day is going to bring and they had a, like a maid who would take care of the daughter and th ey would let me help her. And they would teach me how to take the dust, not like that, like that. How to clean house. All that what my mother never asked from me. She said, "One day you'll be on your own. If you're rich, you'll have a maid. If you don't know what to do with yo urself, you won't be able to tell her how to do it. So I want you to know , I want you to do it. And then you can give orders to somebody else. But first, you have to teach yourself to do it. You have to decide your own, because you never know, maybe you have no parents one day". She knew that it mi ght happen. She wanted to prepare me mentally, as well as her husband who, I told you, was very intelligent and was very realistic and he thought it might happen that she will be alone left, so let's prepare her. But, I didn't want to think about it. Sometimes yo u know it's going to happen, but you don't want, you don't want to think it's going to happen, you don't want to accept it. But that's it. Q: How long did you live in hiding with these people? A: I lived two years. They wanted, also, after the war, not to give me back, they wanted to adopt me when my uncle ca me and stayed. Bu t the aunt was not pleasant because she left her husband and went away with the Englishman and for a long time the husband though t that I had something to do, that I helped her out. And I didn't know, I was very naive. They used to go everything, Monday, to Brussels, and they t ook me along, we went to movie, we went shopping, after the war, the wife of my uncle, my aunt. And then one day I became sick, they went by themselves, they never took me again. They liked to be by them self. I didn't know why, they had an affair, I didn't know what's an affair. I didn't know what's an affair. So he was a little angry at t he end, he say, "I give so much of myself to that girl and she didn't be thankful to me". So my uncle said, "S he was naive, it's not that she was mean or what. Sh e didn't understand". Q: Your uncle thought that somehow you had a role in his wife? A: The uncle, the non-Jew. Yes. Q: The pretend uncle. A: The pretend uncle thought I have a role by helping them to get together while I didn't understand and I didn't want to say that on the tape , I'll tell you later, I didn't understand. That I'm helpi ng or not, I didn't grasp, I wasn't like that. Q: Were you able to hear anything about your parents during, when you first moved in with these people who hid yo u? Did you keep in touch at all? A: A week or two, that's all. A week or two. Two weeks, that's all, not more. Q: So how did they keep in touch? A: The people who lived nex t door to us would call him at work, my uncle, my pretend uncle, but then they stopped calling. And when they were taken away, and the money finished, every three months th ey paid for me, they paid money, they should keep me. So she us ed to say to me, "How wi ll we get the money?" Because they also took me a lot because of the money they needed, naturally. So the man, the owner from th e apartment, non-Jew, used to send the money every three months like before. His own money. Q: A friend of your father? A: No, the owner of the ap artment where we lived, my parents, he sent his own money because he said later, he was afraid maybe I'll give me up or what and he send the money every three months. And we in touch with his son, he's dead. His son is in touch and he would say the nicest thing in every letter for Christmas and New Year that he writes me , "My father didn't save you to go to a country where there is war all the time. My father didn't save you". Every year he writes me the same sentence. A nice man, he's around my age and he's nice. We used to play when we were young and he's very nice, he writes me very nice letters. And such kind of people I like get in touch and like to be in touch. Q: So how long was it after you went into hiding th at your parents were deported? A: Half a year, four months. Four months. Q: How did you hear abou t that? Who told you? A: A long time after that th ey told me. They didn't tell me that when it was fresh, months after that, they didn't want me to know, they didn't know what reaction I will have and they didn't know. They didn't tell me that when it was fresh. Q: When they did tell yo u the story, who told you? A: My aunt, my aunt. It was Raphael, yeah, Raphael to ld her a few days after because she didn't live far aw ay, but she told me. She first prepared me a little and she say, you know, "They're deporting a lot of Jews from Antwerp", and they would never had been deported so fast if not that woman because in the street where we lived, was two Jews, a man and a family and we, like I told you, it was not a Jewish neighborhood. But if not that woman, maybe they will stay til after the war or maybe a few months, but it was not a Jewish neighborhood and all the people knew each other and they wo uld never squeal like she did. She really squealed on them. Q: How do you know what happen ed, how did you get the details? A: Somebody after the war told my uncle that they were taken to Auschwitz and that's it. That's it. Q: But the story that you tell, for instance, abo ut your brother hiding, how did you... A: There was that woman on the third floo r, was like, how do you say, easy, easy going, and after the war went to her office and suddenly I feel a woman giving me a slap on the face and shouting and __________ and everybody turns around. She didn't know that I'm alive and that I wa s hidden and she, when the German came, wanted to take, like I told you, my brot her, hid him under her bed, didn't want. So she knew and she saw when they were taken away, sh e told me ever ything then. Q: She hit you? A: She got so excited, nervous, she didn't know that I was alive and at the same moment, she remembered that she wanted to save my brother and he didn't want to stay with her, so she was so, I don't know how to say in En glish, she was very, she was out of herself seeing me in there, it was not that she hi t me from anger or what, she was so, she couldn't believe that it 's me in the stair. If I, it would be 20, 30 years you can change, but that was three, four year s, so I didn't change so much in the four years, that she didn't recognize me. And I was with my uncle, my uncle didn't unders tand, too, and then she excused herself, we went to drink a cup of coffee and she explained. And she told us that an d then at night, the same night, I was very hysterical. And what my uncle did to calm me do wn, but I was very, I knew they not coming back, but the way she told us in there, it was reopen the wound they call it. It was like reopening a wound. That's it. Q: But also maybe helping to close it, possibly. A: Yeah. Q: You were getting some informatio n that you didn't necessarily have. A: It was bad information and you wanted to know, so it's both together, you understand? It was info rmation, good and no t good. It can be sad, if it's good or not good. Q: When were you told that your parent s were deported? Ho w old were you, do you remember? A: Around 16, 16. Q: After about a year or two? A: Yeah. No, when I was, a month or two after they were deported. When I heard they wouldn't come back, we used to ha ve 13 bedrooms and then every two days my uncle would sell another bedroom be cause he saw there is nothing, nobody coming back. And we had saved a few apartments from the family, we had a big house with a lot of bedroo ms. So every night I woul d come back, there would be another bedroom for me. Se e and it was very demoraliz ing, very. And then my uncle took his package and went to Sout h America. And I stayed in Belgium. Q: Who told you that they had been deported? I mean, where were you? A: I was with my uncle and it was... Q: Pretend uncle? A: No, no. It was my real uncle, after the war and they, I don't remember, it was some friends of my uncle that they heard from somebody else th at was in the camp with my parents. And they saved themself. There was a few, very few, people that came back from Auschwitz, not many. Maybe if my brother wouldn't have gone in the line for my father, beca use they took younger people separate, he would have lived, but he wanted only to be with my father, he was very close to my father. And he was young, they would have kept him, they would put him to work or, but he didn't want. Q: He was like your father who stayed with his father. A: Yeah. Maybe. Q: I just want to get this clear, though. When were you, you weren't told right away that they were deported, who told you that and were you still, you must have still been in hiding? That they had left your home. A: Oh, that was months after, two months after I was hiding. My pretend aunt. Yeah. The man, who later on paid for me, must have called or written to her about that. And if I didn't get any mail, I neve r looked at the mail, understand. Q: What did it mean, did you know then that they had been sent to Auschwitz? A: No, no, no. I knew they were deported, but at that time we di dn't know what and when or Auschwitz, no, we didn't know. Didn't know . Some of the people who went to Auschwitz, I read a lot about it, didn't know. They didn't kn ow. But, like again, I tell you, if they would have, if they would take me, they would take my pretend aunt and uncle because there were a lot of people that happened to them. And some Jews squealed on other Jews, like that boy who wanted to squeal on me. He said, "Why should I go, why shouldn't she come?" I don't know what an interest, I wouldn't do it be cause why should I take you? It's enough I, but people are selfish so they want you to be in the same situation... End of Tape 1. Tape 2 Q: This is an interview with Anny Kas t, K-A-S-T, conducted by Katie Davis on August 5 in Silver Spring, Ma ryland. This is tape number two, side A. Did, was your friend, Raphael, whose papers you had, you were pretending to be Raphael, was she ever able to come visit you duri ng that time that you were in hiding? A: I think she was th ere once, that's all. Yeah. Because they tried not to have people over, they say they brought over their niece, me , and they didn't want. Because she was also a child, she can say something that she shouldn't or what. Neighbors and it was not, no t recommended. Probably that 's what the aunt said, I will have to ask when I see her, God will, how many times or if she came. But I don't think more th an once, if I remember well, but I'll have to ask her. Q: Did you ever feel someti mes, you're a young girl, di d they actually call you Raphael? Did they say, Raph ael, when they called you? A: No, when there was no one strange, they wouldn't call me, my name is Anny, they wouldn't call me Anny, they would call me a short cute name, Annime(ph), that's my Anny, but if you would be th ere or a stranger, they would call me, Jeanine(ph). She changed my name from Raphael, J eanine to Raphael. My name, at home and at school was Jeanine, it was a French name. And then she changed it when she went to France and she wants only to be called Raphael. Must be that her real name now is officially Raphael, because when I send her a check I write Raphael, too. So it must be. Q: So was there ever a time when you felt like telli ng people, I'm Anny Kast, I'm not, was there ever just a rebellious... A: Anny Rubenstock(ph). Q: Anny Rubenstock. A: No, never talked. No, you see, that man wanted to know, I never told, because she told me, "Never tell anyone. Yo u are Jeanine __________, and that's it. Nobody ever has to know that". She never, she didn't let me and I didn't do it. And I went to the nuns for the English less on or what, sometime s they would say, "Jeanine". I would look, I wouldn't know, you know? It reminds me they wanted to take me in Israel to the __________ and spy. After the war when I came to Israel because I know language and I went through so mu ch. So one of my friends spoke to somebody about spies, so that man came and he asked me, would I be interested to be in a, woul d I be interested to be in another country and work for Israel? I say, "Yes". They went throug h with all the, now I d on't like to go to a doctor, I went to doctors for months, I went to psychiatrists, I we nt to everything. But when did I fall through? When they say if I knew to hold a gun, I say, "No". I say __________. But they would go and find out who are my friends, what's my family, they went in the ba ckground. But then when the called the hospital, they called my name, I don't reme mber what it was, I jump ed up, I forgot it's my, because I didn't go to my name. They di dn't want me to know. It reminds me when they said, "Jeanine" in sch ool, I looked like, it's not me. And the teacher says, "Jeanine". And oh yeah, it's me. Q: You had a photograph with you. You did have a photograph __________ didn't you? A: At that time, yeah. Q: Who gave it to you? A: I don't remember. I don't have one picture from my brother, not one. I don't have it. That's it. Q: Do you still have the photograph of your parents? A: Yeah. I have of my parents __________, my mother, she was a beautiful woman, that's my mother. It's beauti ful, no? Yeah. They say she dressed beautiful and she wa s a beautiful woman. Q: This is in the 20's maybe? A: Probably. But look at the clothes. Q: Gorgeous. A: The long clothes. Q: Yeah, it's very long. A: Yeah, that's what they wore then. Q: Do you think your father made that coat? A: No, no, no. Q: No. Do you remember, what did yo u, what was your idea of what was happening to people when they were deported? Did you have any sense of what was really going on? A: Nobody had a sense. At that time , nobody had a sense, nobody knew. They didn't talk about it so much, they didn't know that, we knew it's not good, it's not a good sign because I was reading. I will tell you an example, my aunt, __________, her mother was English, Polish and her step-father was En glish, she was 82 years, very religious man, she was 45. She married him for his money. Really. Q: __________. A: My aunt's mother, my aunt, real aunt. My father's brother's wife. And the man was 82, extremely religious , the woman had only one daughter, my aunt, and wanted to leave when she would die, everything her daught er. So she married that man to be rich. And I was sitting by my aunt, make believe, and I had a paper, the Belgium, __________ was a German, went in the house where she lived, cut her tongue and made him a cripple, and they both died. I read it in the paper, my aunt never would have known. I gave her the paper years later. So, __________, got the money and she married that man at age 43, 82. I remember as a child, he had a white beard, he was a very old man. You know, when you are 15, 14, 13, and a man of 82, an antique, but it was also a for her, she wa s 42 years, she married a man of 84. Just for the money and then he died, she died, she never got the money. She had to stay with a man so ol d. So, and then, you know, a man 82 was old, now it's not th e same, but then, especially a re ligious and the beard and the... Q: Do you remember beginning to hear or think maybe the Ge rmans are going to be defeated? A: We heard about it and they bombarded a lot of the time, the little town where we were near the train and they bombarded, we were all t he time hiding out in the cellar. And during the bomb ardments, the end of the wa r, and we say maybe the problems will be solved. We didn't know, you know, maybe the people will come back. Maybe, the problems will be solved, let's put it this way. But, we didn't know what to expect. No, you didn't know. You didn't k now what's going to be and what's going to happen. Not at all. Q: Tell us about when things changed, when the Germans were defeated. A: When they were defeated, so my make believe aunt went with me to the nuns and told them that I was Jewish, but I liked their behavior and that I studied well and they helped me a lot in life and I went then and I bought a big plan t, flowers for the Mother Superior, who was very nice to me. We were happy. Because they never knew, she never told them. It was nice. Q; What did they say? A: They were stunned at firs t, they looked and they didn't really believe that they did such a thing because they knew as well as she, if I would ha ve been taken, the same would happen to he r. She, they knew it and sh e knew it all along. But she has to hide me but she has to hi de that she has me in her house. Q: How long did she wa it before the German s were defeated to do that? Did she feel confident right afterwards? A: I think she waited about a week or wha t, something, to tell them. And to tell them this whole story and my parents were taken away and we don't know what happened, what will happen with me because we didn't hear yet from my uncle that he was alive and she said to the nuns, "I'll be coming", because she wants to adopt me. You understand that that's a decision that she and her husband made, but nothing came out. Q: Do you remember, was there like a very distinctive memory from liberation, of Allied troops? A; Oh, yeah. Q: Tell us about that. A: It was something very, very plea sant, the whole town and everybody. Especially, I was extremely, extremely h appy and jovial, how do you say, because I knew maybe I will see my par ents soon and my brother, my family, so it was my wish. Everybody had anothe r wish, to see their beloved or wh at, but I, I just thought about that, that soon, __________ to me I will go to my pa rents, that they will be better than her. You understand? But it took time. Then after a few weeks, my uncle came and, we ll, he came from the nuns and he had taken his house back. Q: Who had been in the house? A: Nobody. Q: Okay. A: They had taken out a lo t, the German furniture, go od things, antiquities, but otherwise they left the house and it was not __________, but it was a terrible feeling to go in the house because I re member like now, ther e was a long hall and there was a little shoe of the little girl they took away, a year and a half, it was on the floor, that she lost. __________ So, a million and a half children they killed, what do you want. A million and a half. That's a lot. Q; So you went in the hous e with him and there were so me of these items from, it was like going into a time capsule? A: It was terrible. An example, the po t was on the gas for a year and a half. Because it was Friday ni ght and they made food, it stays overnight, cooking __________, you know what it is because they wouldn't cook on Saturday. And that pot was on the, you know, it's like you leave now al l dead and I come back and see four empty glasses while nobody lived here. Who we re the four people? Who drank from that. So it's a very, very unpleasant fee ling. So then, when I met people, they didn't go through nothing, they stayed with their husband and children and they saved themself, they're gettin g money from Germany and how much you want. So it hurt me. Becaus e I say, even if I wouldn't n eed the money I'll give it to Raphael, but it should co me to me more than to you that you had your family, you stayed all over the war with your fa mily. That's a big plus. Right? Q: Do you, what was it like when you first saw your uncle? A: It was a good feelin g, good feeling. But, I still, at that time, I suffered a lot from my eyes, I cried a lot, I crie d day and night. And I came to my uncle and I say, "I want to see you, but I want to see my parents". The he took me to see my grandmother who spent all the war in the hospital, I told you and came out. She was the first funeral, Jewish funeral in An twerp when she died. But before she died and I used to come to her, she was a little mixed up, bu t still she would say, "Why doesn't your father come to see his mother, why do you come to see me?" Understand? She didn't grasp the situation. I didn't know then. But she was the first funeral, my uncle was very upset. So, he said, "If you don't st op crying, I'll put you in with your grandmother because you have to stop crying". But some people can cry when they're told enough. It's a thing that's inside. Or you cry or you don't cry, right? Q: It sounds like you did cry. A: Oh, a lot. Q: You cried. A: Cried a lot. Q: Cried yourself out. A: Yeah. Now, when my hus band died, I cried a little bit, I can't cry and that's bad. I envy these people who crying, crying, crying, for no reason. And when you __________, you cry, it's good. It's very healthy th ey told me. Q: So what did your uncle say? I mean, obviously, w hat did you uncle say about your parents? And th en what might happen? A: He didn't know at the time . He didn't know. He only said, "Let's hope they come back". At that time, there was still a lot of hope. You und erstand? Everybody hoped it will go okay. Q: So you didn't go, did you ever go to your family apar tment? You were in your uncle's house, but did you ever go to the apartment where you lived with your family? A: I went to these people who paid for me and I was very nice to them . What a gift. And my uncle paid them back for all these years that th ey paid, you know, they were very nice. I w ent to say hello to th em. But it was a half a year after I stayed with my uncle. And all my friends started to go out, have a good time and I never had a good time. Because I worked. My uncl e opened a store in Belgium and I used to sell the American , the English, [phone ri nging, pause in tape]. Q: So it was just your uncle and you? A: Yeah. No, it was, after that, came a nephew from his wife, from Treblinka. And he was Polish and didn't know Belgium, bu t he heard somebody is __________ and he stayed with us. And my uncle when to South America, he wanted everything, everything. He came back from Treblinka where he saved himself. And that's it. He came like from nowhere. Q: Did he talk about what it was like in Treblinka? A: I don't re member because he used to talk very badly Jewis h, a lot of lot of Polish and I didn't know a word of Polish. But he spoke very little. When he came, he weigh maybe, he was maybe like that. So later he gained weight and he became more person. But when he came he was very depressed and my uncle helped him a lot. But otherwise, it was the two of us, that's all. Q: How, tell us again how you finally rea lly heard about your parents. When that was and how you heard what happened. A: I tell you, I heard that they were taken away a fe w weeks after I was hidden. And then only after the war, a month or two, maybe later, they started to __________ us that people were killed and gassed and so on. Before that, people didn't know, we didn't know what happened . Then we were, started to understand and to know. Q: What were your thoughts when you first heard this story? A: My thought was that it happened, but not maybe to them. At that point, and __________ very selfish, but I thought, no, it didn't happen to them. It happened, but not to them. See, you d on't realize that it can happ en to your own, too. You think it's only to , that's all. Q: And who was it who to ld you, who was there in Auschwitz with them? A: A friend of my uncle came back who saved himself. Q: Tell us who he was. A: I didn't know the man, it's a man who knew my un cle and who came back and who said that he had been with my parents and my brother, and he knows they gone. He knows. How the man saved himself or what, I don't remember, I can't tell you. But he saved himself. Q: And did he tell the story of how... A: My uncle never told me . Maybe he didn't want to hurt me or maybe he didn't want me to know or anyway, in short, he never told me specifically what, when and how. He didn't. I think he didn't want it. Q: You think he knew? A: I think he knew. More than he told me. Q: Did you want to know? A: Yeah, I asked a few times and I insisted a few ti mes, and he would change the subject and tell me, "One day s oon I'll tell you more if I know. If I meet a man". But I didn't ask, I know my uncle, he asked, but he didn't want to, didn't want me to ask, you understand? Q: This was your father's brother? A: Brother, right. Q: Did he know how his wife and children __________. A: Yeah. Also, some body told him and how they, it was his father, his wife, his two children and his parents-in -law. They had another daughter who was pregnant seven months who went to France, they went to the France that wa s not occupied and they paid a fortune and they was taken there with somebody, but they were shot while crossing the border. With th e money they paid and everything and she pregnant, walking hours at ni ght, they were shot. And she was young surely, 26, 25, I don't know. Q: How did you feel towards, did you ev er see anybody who ha d collaborated with the Nazis? For instance, the family that squealed, as you say, squealed on your family? A: No. We didn't... Q: __________ A: I never saw them, I never saw them. An d then when I came after the war, that woman and that man that were with th e American who saved himself and worked underground, they say they had moved shortly after my parents were taken away. Maybe they were afraid, I do n't know, she moved. She wa s there living with two or three daughters, I don't remember, but she was, I'm going to smoke a cigarette. Do you mind? Five minutes. Q: Did you, were you ever able to go back into your house, the house you grew up in with your parents, and get anything? A: Oh, no. They had some things, but people they never gave back. And the strangers that I came to wouldn't let me in. No. And meet my sister-in-law, Patty. Q: Hi. So you went to the house where you grew up and who was living there? A: Strangers, people. That I never met, they didn't know me an d wouldn't let me in. The owner of the house, I stayed a while with him, he say he can't ask them, if they don't want. So I wen t. But I went to this neighbor , who wanted to save my brother, and she accepted me really, the one who wanted to slap my face. She was very nice. She didn't slap my face because she was mean or what, it was a kind of excitement a nd surprise to see me. You know? If you think that person is no more and suddenly you find out the person is ther e, it's a very big, it was something she'll neve r forget as long as she lives. She was an old woman then, she must be dead, but she was very, and then it's her na ture, she was very excitable in general, I remember as a child , so when she saw me and that uncle of mine, she, she got so hysteric al, I'll never forget as long as I live how hysterical. From happiness. Q: Tell us what it was li ke to see your best friend, Raphael __________, who you, whose identity you assumed. What was it like to se e her for the first time? A: It was, it's a pity you don't know French, otherwise I would send you copies, she wrote me like, now that my husband died, and she writes to me very often. The way she writes, she writes very well. She has nobody, no sister, no brother, no nothing. And she's very, ve ry, very warm and close to me . She, for da ys and days, she wouldn't leave me. She' d come to my uncle every da y in the morning and stay til at night because she was so happy to s ee me and be with me and that. And she loved Israel. We went to the Hilton in Jerusalem and my husband wanted to stay overnight. She wants to go to a kibbutz. She doesn't want to stay. Very simple, but very nice, very nice. And she happe ned to be a very intelligent girl that her life changed now, but she was over-excited so in 1960 my aunt __________ went to Nice in France and she took care of her house, because with a lake and a swimming pool and everything in Nice. And I lived in Israel and she wanted me to come. She told the man, "In case you want me to take care of the house, there is condition that I have to bring her over, I wa nt to see her for six weeks". So I went there, everybody in Israel thought, she must be rich, she goes to Nice for vacation for six weeks. It was a luxury then. Now, everybody travels, but then it was a luxury. And she invited Raph ael, too, for six weeks. Bu t she wouldn't take a cent from me, you know, she love s me. But she would take from my niece. So I remember, I paid for the niece. Q: What did you talk about when she, when you first saw her after being in hiding and she was spending so much time __________. A: I was telling her, I was telling her what I went through and that her aunt was very nice to me. She wa s very, very, very stingy, very demanding I should learn and study and do and kept me busy all the time. And she sa id, "I know, that's the reason I never wanted to live with her". But, thank God, she say, she did something for you. And she was happy and she's happy til now when I write her a letter. And when I was sick and my husban d died, she would call me from France and Israel twice a week and she really can' t afford it. So, and she came to Israel, she took out a hundred dollar bill and she said to my hus band, "Can you change it in Israeli money?" He said , "What do you need money for? Anny pays for you". "No, no, no. I want to get her a gift". He says, "She doesn't need it". So we gave her cash when she left, a few hundred dollars, she wouldn't take, she says she wants a check. She's so primitive, a ch eck she won't lose, the money she'll lose, maybe you want to buy something. She' s very, but she's not demanding, oh, she's so nice. She's very artistic . She wrote to Belgium to a friend of hers who paints, to paint me a scarf, hand paint on silk. She would send it from Belgium to France, from France she would send it to me. Very artistic. And I say, "What do you want?" She wants a Star of David. So I send her with somebody, a Star of David with a gold chain. So when she came to Israel, she say, "Can I have a silver David Star?" "Why?" "One for the weekend and one for the week". So, but she is a very good, very warm person, very warm person. Q: Did you stay in touch with your pretend aunt and uncle? A: I told you. After the war, she left him for the Englishman. An d he was a little angry thinking that I had so mething to do. Wh en my uncle called him and wrote to him a few times because he wanted him to be on good, on good terms with me, but it was hard to make him belie ve that I didn't know. He told him, she was innocent, she was very naive and so on. And he wouldn't accept it, wouldn't accept it because he was a very, very cultivated, serious man, while that Englishman was very primitive. And that's t he end. And it's a pity he di dn't believe my uncle or me that I had nothing to do with that. And that's it. And sh e used to write to me after the war and she used to be in touch with me, wanting to know what I do and so on, but that's it. [end of side 1 of tape 2] Q: What was life like, you're in Antwerp no w, right? Was it ha rd to get food after the war? A: No, not so bad. Not so bad. It was hard after my uncle left, I was left alone. Q: Tell us about that, why... A: My uncle left to South America and... Q: When did he leave? A: In 1947, six, after the war. Went to his brother's. And he married, children. And I say I want to stay in Belgium because I wa nt to go first to Israel to meet my family I don't know and then come to South Americ a. And meantime, I stayed in Belgium, 18, 19, wanted to say in Belgium. But, my dream was all these years, to go to Switzerland to study international translation, instantanic(ph). I couldn't afford and I was too proud to ask my uncl e. And I'm sorry to now because they say if I would have asked, they would have helped and I would have a g ood thing to go on in the world. I could use it anywhere I want. But I didn't do it. So, in Belgium, I really didn't have a job for work and there was that store where they sold blankets and suits from the military, the American, it wa s very heavy beds, hard job. I went in and I said the man I want to work. He say, "You so little, what will you do here". But it happened to be the father of my friend, I told you before that said, "Come with me, we'll put lipstick, we' ll go out". And he had remarried and __________ child, but he knew I was his daughter's friend, so he gave me the job. And he kept me, I didn't work too hard, just ma ke believe I work to give me salary because I was so good with his daughte r that died. She was a beauty , she was a beauty. Her name was Betty, I remember. Beautiful gi rl. And then I went to Israel. Q: You say you went, but how did you get there? A: Oh, I didn't get a ticket because my uncle from South America paid and went to Israel to visit my uncle, I had an uncle, br other of my mother and two sisters. Went to visit them and then I stayed there, and that's a mistake I did in my life. Because I didn't want to stay with them and I started, like I worked for nine years in a French library, only French. So, my uncle wanted me to go and study Hebrew, but I saw they don't have money and th ey need my help, so I went and I worked, 10 years. Then we opened another store, in a library, in a lending librar y in Haifa, and I became the manager, was the only one, only French. Q: What kind of store? A: French books, study, studying books, novels, magazines, only French. And then I became the manager. And I used to go to South Amer ica and come back and go to South Americ a and come back. And then I had a bad marriage of three years, four years. And no children or what. And then my family wanted me to stay in Uruguay. But I said a condition is if I can work and keep up and just come for the weekend to you. No, they want me to st ay with them and not work. So I took my package, I went back to Isra el. And I found ou t that working in the lending library and that was too many hours from eight in the morning to seven at night. So I wanted to get shift wo rk. So I worked in Israel for five years and I enjoyed it very much, in the censor, you know what censor. Q: A censor. A: A censor, in international calls, so I used to work with five, six countries at once, they were so happy with me. And I loved the job. And that was anot her job I work at from two to nine, from three to ten, no t all day long. You k now. And that's it. And then I met my husband here in Israel. And he was a professor in Hebrew. Q: What was his name? A: Isaac. Q: Kast. A: Kast. And he want, he didn't want, they wanted him to work in the Library of Congress, he didn't want, he finished English and French, Hebrew. He wanted on to teach Hebrew, so he went to a privat e here in Washington , Yashiva(ph) Hebrew Academy, if you've heard. And he worked there. And when I came here to live, lived 27 years here, so when I came to live here, he didn't want me to work. But I didn't want to stay home 24 hou rs with no children, so I started to work, manager of a thrift store Haddasah(ph). And I used to send $100,000 a year for Haddasah Jerusalem. Q: Haddasah? A: Haddasah Hospital. Q: Oh, okay, yeah. A: But I worked as a volunt eer and we made money, $100,000 a year, after all the expense. And I worked there a lot. Q: Where was this thrift shop? A: In Silver Spring, it is. Q: It's still there? A: Still there. Yeah. Q: Let me go back to, how did your mother's family get to Israel? A: They went as y oung girls, shortly af ter my mother went to Belgium with my father. They got married, had family. My uncle was... Q: They were in Palestine? A: In Palestine. My un cle was the only son and there were five daughters. And then at the end, before he died, that was __________ sad, had a big job in the government. And he had his family and they had a fami ly and that's where they lived. They used to write to my mother and my father, please come here, we'll send you the paper. So my uncle at that time worked on a train, I remember, he was the conductor. So my mother told me, "When you go to Israel, you'll go on the train, your uncle will be the conductor". And we not ready for such a life. They begged them to come. If they would have come, they would ha ve been saved, but they didn't want. They had pity th at they had such a hard life because then in Palestine you know it was all primitive, it was very hard . Not like now, it's luxury. So, that's it. Q: What, I mean what were your feelings when you went to Israel? Did you, did you go after it had been declared a state? A: Yeah. Q: Okay. A: Yeah, I went after it wa s a state. I liked it very mu ch, I liked my family. But I found it a hard life to live, it was hard. It was very, very primitive at that time. But, I felt good with my family and in the coun try. I just did. Q: What did you speak? A: I couldn't talk to them. My cousin didn't know any Yiddis h, he knew Hebrew, and I didn't know it. Didn' t know any English. So, we spoke broken Yiddish, my uncle and me. But then, with the time, I learned the langua ge from the street like they say. And then I went to a boarding school for six months and I learned Hebrew. And my Spanish, French is better than my Hebrew, but it's okay. I know how to talk. Q: Did they, did they remind you of your mother? Did they seem like her, their mannerisms? A: Yeah, yeah, no, no, they looked a little like my mother, they would always ask me questions and so on. But, they were no t, they had another kind of life than we had in Belgium. And then I went to, nearly every year and a half or six months, to South America to my family. Because they wanted me to be there. And __________ the uncle who was with me, lives in Israel, and my th ree other uncles live in South America. Q: Your uncle... A: The, yeah, he lives in Israel. Q: He's still alive? A: Yeah. He's old, he's losing his strength. Q: What is his name again? A: Israel(ph). Q: He must be a fascinating man. A: Yes. He's very nice. Q: This was your mother's brother? A: No, my father's brother. Q: Your father's brother. A: Right. Q: Yeah. I just had a question, I have so many questions. Where do you feel home is? A: I'll tell you the truth, I feel good here with the childr en of my sister-in-law, but I feel better in Israel because I have a lo t of friends now and I have my family, mostly, feel better, just that life is a little harder. Even now, with all the comfort that you have, you have a lot of comfort like be fore, used to work without air condition and it was hotter than here. But now, everything is beau tiful now and it's good. And people say, "You're not afraid?" And I'll tell you on th at answer, you never know where to be afraid beca use I had a very good friend, by the way, who lived in Israel and her son finished college here. And he came back to Israel and they didn't want him to go to the army because maybe he'll be killed or what, God forbid. So they moved to New York and in a few, many years ago, there was something near the, near the, some people went in in the lunch room and they killed some people. And if you will reme mber a few years ago, and he was on e of them. His wife was pregnant eight mont hs. So he was killed. Maybe he would have made the army and not be killed. So you cannot be afraid beca use it won't help you. And you can't live in a country, every minu te you be afraid or you'll get crazy. Q: Were you afraid a lot when you were in hiding? A: I was all the time tense, as young as I was. And mayb e for that I'm still a little nervous, but I don't show it. Because now my sister-in-la w is not so well, but why should I shout or be angry on her or what, I'm not that type. I was not brought up like that. But inside maybe I'm nervous because I went through a lot and it hurt me a lot when I didn't get more, or how much did I get? Four or five thousand dollars, that's all from the German. While all thes e friends that I know, are getting monthly good incomes. One of my fr iends went and she said that she's not, her mind is not good. She's a year younger than I. So they made her a, an exam. She said stupid things, she's very smart. An d now she gets eight or ni ne hundred dollars a month on Germany because she's incapable. That's what they say. She's much more capable than I will ever be, but she succeeded by lying and I'm not the type who will lie. I'm not going to lie for money. I'm not going to lie for money. But I went through, like you heard, a lot. And people who went much less through, that I know, and they are alon e, they say, you should get more than I, or you should get, but, you should ge t. You understand? Q: Tell us, when you applied for that. A; I applied and I got, oh, three thousand or four thousand dollar. Q: __________. A: In 1952, 53 , and then they gave me the three thousand dollars, I shouldn't have taken it, but nothing to do. And then they refuse and they, now I know the reason. My uncle went through a lot, he lost a wife and two children, but I had a lawyer in Belgium, he was no good. That's the mistake. If you would go, it was then, you know, agencies took care of all that, and they would help you and do it. I didn't go, I went to a lawyer who took a lot of money in advance, who didn't go anything. Maybe he got six thousand, he gave me thre e thousand or four thousand. But all these friends of mine, I don't know if they got a sum, but they got, they get every month now. And they really don't believe, I wouldn't lie, if I would get, I would say, why, why the lying? Some people like to lie, I don't like to lie. If I don't get, I don't get. I'm not going to say I don't get when I get. Or I get when I don't get. Q: Could you appeal it, then? A: I think it's too late. I think it's too late. Q: Have you ever been to Germany? A: I've never gone. You? No, I would never go. No interest. Q: What about going to a place like Auschwitz. A: I'll tell you the true, I don't, I went through now a lot, too, last year with my husband being very sick and all the family wanted me to put him away __________ and I didn't, I took care. So maybe another year or what, you know, will be more relaxed, maybe I'll do it. Because my cousin wanted very bad to go, the one from Israel, to the place where I was born and where our gr andmother was living, but I wasn't ready to go with he r because he was sick. Now maybe, I'll take a rest a year, if I'm capable to conc entrate and relax, maybe I would do it. But not now for the moment. Q: When did your husband die? A: January, so it's still fresh. Q: Oh, yes. A: It's still very fresh. Q: __________. A: Yeah. Still fresh, so, I was all by myself and it's not easy. So, that's what it is. Q: How old was he? A: Was not young, was 78, but _________, very intelligent man, but very sick. So, he just suffered the last two months, few mont hs. So nothing could be done, so it's a pity. Q: Did you, did you purposely not have children or was that a decision you made together? A: No. It didn't come out, I'll tell you why I think. Because when we married, his mother became old, she stayed with her dau ghters, we used to go there all the time and all the time and years w ent by and you know, sometimes years go so fast that you don't know. You turn ar ound and you're middle aged, you're old, no? It's like that. Q: So you've always been with people who are always very, taking care of their families? A: Yeah. Q: __________ your father. A: Yeah, and then al so, then also I used to be very friendly with somebody, she had four children and I was th ere and I took care most of the time of the children and now I don't know if they'l l recognize me. That 's it. Some stay friends with you, but some, ignore you, let's put it this way. Q: What was it like when you go t, to go back a little bit now, to Israel , this idea that you had to hide being Jewish and you could, for so long, and they got, created terrible danger for people you loved, to be in a country where you could be completely open and proud of being Je wish. What was that like for you? A: When? When I came to Israel? Q: When you first went to Israel and you could, you could be really relaxed. A: Yeah, I enjoyed it . I enjoyed it. But I had a hard time because used to live in the suburbs and go, and go to Tel Aviv and stay from eigh t in the morning in that heat til seven at night. No t be able to refresh or wha t. And from one to four, the stores would be closed, so I just walked ar ound, I didn't have what to do. So it was very hard, you understand? So I couldn't enjoy life enough bec ause I had a hard time. And I wasn't so close to my family there because I didn't know them so long as my other family that I grew up with them. So it was very hard. But I came over that, too. Q: Tell us a little bit about life in Uru guay, which is where yo ur uncle lived. Who was there and what was __________. A: He had two brothers, he had two brothers and they h ad families. And then he got married, he had his own family. And when the children became bigger, he was afraid they'll marry, intermarriage, so he moved everything to Is rael. They should get married with Jewish girls, that's what they did. Because, you know, so much intermarriage, I don't have to tell you, no ? So, and he's very religious, so, very religious. So. Lived a Je wish life and always very nice. The women have it very easy, a maid costs you thirty or forty dollars a year, a mo nth, so you can afford two maids. And life is easy, but it's still not like in Israel, it's still, it's still different. Like here, it's very nice, but here wi thout a car, wi thout, it's very hard, I don't have to tell you. Where do you live? Q: Downtown Washington D.C. A: So it's not easy. Q: When were you ever able to say to yourself finally , my brother and my mother and father aren't coming back? A: That was a few good months after the war. A few good months after the war. When I saw the reality that the people w ho came, came alread y, and other ones won't come. And they began to talk and to show and then we sa w that you have to accept the truth. And the reality. It was not easy in the beginning because you used to see, to go, then th ey didn't go like now to Au schwitz to look and that. People didn't go like now to go, but we all the time as ked, asked, we heard that somebody came back and we went and mayb e he was seeing th em and that, that must be the way my uncle found that man who saw my parents. That he found out that that man was in Auschw itz and saved himself and ma ybe it was the same time, and he learned that it was the same time. Q: What did these people look like to you, I mean they were presumably coming back very thin. A: Very thin, very nervous, very depressed. But, they began to live and they, that's it. But in the beginning they were very skinny and very down, mentally and physically, both. That's it. Q: I know that at that time they had newsreels of the camps and some photographs. A: Yeah. Q: Do you remember ever seeing that? A: No. I never saw that __________. They were all so like the museum, they have a place in Brussels now, I would like to go and see that, if God willed, if I had the occasion, they have a very, very big place, so much taller than me, and it's written all the Jews from Antwerp and Brussels who killed where, at Auschwitz or Bergen-Belsen or, where they were killed. What date exactly and what time, what, and I wanted very badly to go. Somebody told me who saw it and my parents were in that list. Somebody told me they didn't see th e list. So I wanted to go by myself once. I want to see, one day I'll go. Q: Do you remember when you fi rst saw photograph s of Auschwitz? A: It wears very much on me, very, made me very depressed. I started to take an anti-depressant and it didn't help me because I was depre ssed mentally very much. And then I see it won't help y ou, being depressed. Talked to myself. But it didn't help, it didn't help the pills, not talking, it was depres sing because some people can see movies and so on and read , they don't mind. But it's, it's a character. Because I say I would never over live it, and some people say I don't know how I ov er lived it and they came out. Q: When was it? When was it that you first saw pictures? A: All the pictures I saw '47 and before, and '46, '47. So, that's what it was. Q: Did you ever, with your uncle, do any sort of service of sit shiva? I mean... A: No, I keep a date that the rabbi gave me, a rabbi in Israel gave me a date and I keep that day, give a, I give a donation to Schul(p h) that day and we say kaddish(ph) and that's all. Q: So you did mark a day? A: Yes. Q: And if you went to that museum, you might find out an actual day. A: That's it, then I might find exactly the day, maybe or approximative. And I would like to go there, but no chance for the last few years be cause of my husband's illness, but one day I'll go. It doesn't do me too good, in '65 I was in Belgium and I went through, went from the house where we lived to where the school was and that. The street didn't c hange, only the stores and the people change. And it did me very bad. Stayed three days and I run away. Th ree days or two days, it was too much. And I think it was too much because I was alone. I was not with a friend or, I wouldn't do that by my self any more. I would only go with somebody or that I care for or, just som ebody, not to go by myself, I wouldn't do it. Also you know, the nights to stay there in a hotel alone and re member the streets an d that. No, no. I wouldn't go back by myself, never. Q: You uncle's still alive, I mean, do you ever think about pressing him for details? A: He had a stroke three years ago and his mind is good and that, I don't think he feels like talking about it. I don't think so. Q: Do you think he'd ever do an oral history interview? A: Doubt it, I doubt it . He's saw my tape w hen I showed it in Is rael and it made him very, don't know, he di dn't feel depress ed really, feel dead beca use in my tape I say my uncle went to Uruguay and left me alone. So it was not a good feeling for people who heard and it was said in the room. You understand? And I couldn't, I couldn't change the tape, the tape was there, the truth was there. Q: Did you feel like that? A: What? Q: That he left you alone? A: Yeah, I felt lost a litt le because I was young and all my friend s had parents and I was no parents, nobody, like left alone. So it hit me a little, you know. Not much, but a little. Q: How long did you stay alone? A: In Belgium, maybe eigh t, nine, ten months. It was too long. It's the way you feel. End of Tape 2. Tape 3 Q: This is an interview with Anny Kas t, K-A-S-T. Conducted by Katie Davis on August 5 in Silver Spring, Maryland. This is tape number three, side A. I'm curious about how you think yo ur experience hiding and your losses, 28 people, how that affected your approach to life? Maybe y our philosophy or your interactions with people? A: The feeling, to tell you the true, I had is that people are alone, like me now, should take care of themself, but I'm the person that I like to give and not wait to receive. I like to give fr om myself, to be go od to people, to help people. If it's mentally or physically or materially, I like to give, I'm not dema nding and I'm not the snob that says I have or don't have. I'm not the type to complain. I had many years that I didn't have and I never complained. An d people never knew if I have or not because I made an impression I have a lot and I liked it be cause I don't want pity. I had enough pity during my first years, I don't want pity. Th at means even if I didn't have, whenever somebody came, I had cake and coffee and fruit and everything. The people came shouldn't know the way I feel. I didn't want them to know. And I'm now like that, too. Even people in Israel, especially , are very curious. They ask you such private question s that I can't accept. Q: About? A: I don't want to say mind your own bu siness, that's rude, but people there ask you, what's your income, wh ere do you live, what do yo u have? I never would think to ask somebody, even somebody I'm very close, it's not my business. And I never, and I had no father, no mother, nothing for many years, I would never be jealous, and that's a character. Or envious, that's the same as jealousy, that you have that dress that cost five hundred dollars or three hund red dollars and I can't afford it, or what. Because if I'll be je alous, it won't help me get that dress because I can't afford it if I don't have that three, five hundred do llars. And it won't make me happier if I'll have that dres s. And if I didn't pay for the dress, it would make me worse because why should I go with a dress that I owe the money and I don't know from where I will take the money. And I never had an envy or jealous character. They always ask me, are you not jealous, this co usin has this, has this, has this. Sometimes I say, poor me, I have no children and it's a pity. But t hen I see the problems my friend ha ve with their children, I say I' m very happy I don't have, what do I need this problems for, I have enough of my own. So, it won't help to be jealous. Q: Were you ever envious, though, that other people h ad their whole families and maybe they didn't know what they have? A: No, but I would be angry and am, not envious exactly, of children my age when I was left alone, they don't appreciate their parents. That, yes. Because I say, they don't know what they have, they should appreciate what they have, they have parents, they have grandparents, they have aunts and uncles and cousins and they, such a big family, they don't know what th ey have. Some k now, but not all. Not all the people know. But it won't help me. But I ne ver was, thank God, envious or jealous, never, never. I hope I will never be. Q: How do you explain that you didn't become a r eally, really bitter person who just saw darkness everywhere, yo u know, that you lost so much and other people who lost what you lost, their entire family... A: They're mo re bitter. Q: And jealous, envious. But how, where did th at come from? A: I think that has to do with upbringing and the characte r of a person. My mother used always to say when yo u're grown up and you have your own house, if people come, never put three cookies on the tabl e, put always five. Maybe somebody wants another cookie. Never say, why don't I have that kitchen set, never say. You'll have it. If you don't have it , it won't help you. She told me, I think, as much as I didn't see her long, no t to be jealous and envious. Because she wasn't. I remember my aunts had so, so much jewelry and so mu ch she didn't have. She never envious. Q: What do you remember most about your mother? A: I remember she was a ve ry good person, very good mother. She wanted me to learn ballet, what I wanted, dancing, ballet. And I went for three years and then my grandfather was so religious, he says, "She cannot dance with her legs nude". So my mother stopped my ballet. But she was a very good person, very good person. Never demanding, she had a hard life, she didn't have th e luxury we have to put the dishes and put the dishes ou t. You know? She had a hard life , she didn't have such a big apartment. I don' t know if she had maids or not, I don't remember, but I know she didn't have a washer or a dryer or something like that, that I'm sure. And also the climate was not like here, so, I don't know. We were alwa ys clean, I don't know when she washed, when she used to take us from school and bring us from school and help us with the lesson what she could and give me private teacher when I needed, when I was a little worse in some st udies or somethings. No, it was, no. But to tell the true, I don't know. She, I think she taught me not to be jealous. And I don't want to be jealous, I'm happy. My sister-in-law says a lot of times, "When will you change?" She doesn't want me to be mean to her, to her I should be good, to othe r people I should be mean. She's also, she's very jealous if I'm nice with somebody. She wants to be the first. It's a character. It's like you want everything for yourself and I tell her, "You are ad dicted to me". She say, "Yes". It's a feeling that a person has. I'm not possessive, I don't want a person to be only mine, she can be everyone's person. But why be possessive ? Will it help? No. It won't help none to be possessive. So what can I hel p? I don't want to be possessive and I'll never be. Q: Well, when you think of your parents, your mo ther and your father, what, is there one memory that is sort of like, if you're falling asle ep and you want to think of them, is there, what's the moment? A: The moment is that, they started to make a more livi ng and live a little easier when they were taken away. And what I remember, as a small child, they had it hard, very hard. And then it started to be a little better and everything broke. And they were not rich or well off or what, but they made a nice living, they had two children and that's it. But it started to be a easier li fe than in the beginning, I remember. She had to go a nd come and help my father and help in the store and cook and have all the problems. You know , mending socks and fi xing that, now all that we don't do. We don't have that life. And she had a hard life, very hard life. And not convenient apartment. I remember when I was a ve ry small child, we didn't even have a bathroom, we didn't. Now each child needs his own bathroom. No, it's true. We didn't have at all. We __________. And then there was more comfort and then when you can enjoy, you come into 40, then it was middle age, you don't, they take it away from you. That's a pity. They could have enjoyed a little, life, a few good years. That's it. Q: Do you have nightmares ever? A: Not especially. But so metimes I would see them and then get up in the morning in a very, not good mood to see somebody. Not in a good mood. But it doesn't help. Q: Because you saw them the night before? A: Yeah, saw them at night, not the night before. I saw them, it was like hours and it's maybe 10 minutes, but it seems like hours, you s ee, and then you close again your eyes, you see again. I don't know if yo u had that. You see somebody and then you want to forget what you saw, and you close your eyes again, you see it again. It must be strong in your mind that you see it again and again. But, that's it. That's enough. Q: Okay. A: Thank you. Q: Thank you very much. Conclusion of interview.
