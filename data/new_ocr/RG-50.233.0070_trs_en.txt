after the first World War and I remember him well b ecause he came to our house once and I remember him on a Sunday morning listening to the radio and because in his own home as a rabbi he did not have one in those days and he was an enormously tall beautifu l looking man with a long beard and the long kaftan and a remarkably sophisticated for th e position he was in. And my mothers younger brother became the rabbi after his father died in this to wn, Hajdunanas, but also very tall and very distinguished looking gentleman. Whenever I heard about my mother's family from strangers, visitors, people who we met as we trav elled somewhere, that they were a very special family because the members of the family were very in telligent and very cultivated people. My mother was in particular spoken of as the most intelligent of all. The kids who had worldly ambitions that she could not fulfill because she was the daughter of a rabbi. She had to toe the line so to speak and could not do really what she wanted to do, but her mind was so active that she absorbed all of the worldly influe nces not only that came her wa y but that she so ught out and she was a reader. She's read such an enormous amount. She was so cultivated and her ambition was to become a physician which she, of course, could not fulfill because of the st atus of her family. You know the very religious rabbinical daughter would not go to a medical school, of course, but she would have to get married at the age of eighteen or nineteen to a chosen groom who was of high reputation. My father was the son of a landowner, a very religious Je wish family from a small town. But an arranged marriage came ab out because he was an outstand ing Talmudic Ye shiva Bucher. How do you translate Yeshiva Bucher? [Yeshiva student] Rabbinical school Rabbinical school and he had an extraordinary mind. As people were ta lking about my mother being so very intelligent he was being talked abou t as being the most learned Talmudic student and indeed he was really famous. Even to the point if today I go to one of these weddings, the descendants of these peop le who come from my mother's hom etown or my homet own or any other part of Hungary, they would remember this very intelligent Toby, my mother's Yiddish name. Toby Tereza, Terry Maria Tereza was her Hungarian name Maria Tereza? Maria Tereza, evidently she was named after the Hapsburg queen and my mo ther named me after Queen Isabella. I don't know what th e association is the royal hangup. Could you please spell your mother's name? I think it was T E R E Z A . And her last name? H A L P E R T And your father's? My father's name was Menhir. I h eard it spelled as Menyhert the e has an umlaut [accent], Katz K A T Z. And he was a very handsome looking man, a really beautiful face. He was totally different from my mother. My mother wa s steeped in this quiet worldly knowledge and cultivation of music and literature and my father shut all of that out entirel y and was only interested and focused in on Hasidic and Talmudic matters and Talmudic world. That was his world. So they were really two opposites, yet giants in their own rights equally matched in level of intellect Yes the level of intellect was on par evidently but one was in total opposition to the other. What kind of schooling did your mother have? Probably public school and probably not much schooling beca use that was forbidden also in that circle but tremendous self educat ion. That was probably on par w ith any college eduction that we know. The six children who came to this insane world of Auschwitz and some of us survived, then to America - whatever we are is what my mother poured into us; not my father at all because we were not interested in his world bu t my mother poured so much into us that I feel we have had an education on top of whatev er little education was available to people in our station. It was so hugely enriched by my mother who endowed us with it, never sto pped. I remember we would ask her questions and she would say "How would I know. I was six year s old a long time ago." Two minutes later she gave the answer, of course. She had the answer to almost everything . We all talk about her with such rich memories and admiration and I am sure it is justified. So many people cannot be wrong. So many people who still mention her with such reverence. I personally was unquestioningly like my father. There was something ab out her and he was now here near as good and gentle as my mother. He wa s much rougher in many ways but somehow I liked him. I always had criticism from my moth er but I didn't like many of the things, many of her ways, but I am my mothers daughter and I am trying to fulfill her exp ectations of me, almost to tally ignoring what my father might have expected from us. As a matter of fact I think al l of us are fulfilling the expectations my mother had of us and trusted that we would come through with those values that she poured into us that were so important to her. And I think we did come through intact almost with her values and her ideas ab out life both in humanitarian me thod which was the number one issue in her life - to be an abso lute humanitarian. Although she was fully aware of the cruelties that man is capable of. I think that probably she didn' t know the details of Auschwitz. She never even heard of Auschwitz because maybe in this country there were head lines in the New York Times but we never heard the word Auschwitz. We lived in a totally repressive count ry where fascism was the order of the day. We didn't kn ow anything. We only knew what Hitler fed us in the controlled press and the controlled radio. So we had absolu tely no way of knowing a nything and we certainly didn't know they were burning people and because we were the last country occupied, all those years passed us by with depriv ations. We did not ge t enough potatoes or enough bread because Hitler stole everything from my country. But we lived in our homes and we had no idea. We never heard the word Warsaw gh etto, only some of these people who were in leadersh ip positions all over. The world knew a great deal more than we knew. We are ev en accused today. Why didn't we do something? Why didn't we go . Who knew anything a nd certainly who would expect that the war is not going to end and we will be alive. We have suff ered deprivations, separation from my father and everything sounded terribly om inous and frightening from what we heard of Hitler's speeches which were on incessantly and that he hates the Jews but none of that added up to a crematorium and we knew that certain people were caught and interrogated and beaten. We heard these stories from people who passed by trying to escape from neigh boring countries which were occupied by Hitler, like Czechoslovakia and Romania. They passed through and told us some horror tales. Those people were interrogated but no one said anything about people being transported in cattle cars to another planet named Ausc hwitz and burned. When we he ard these gruesome stories we were as incredulous as people are today when we tell them about the holocaust. Who would believe it? What kind of stories did you h ear from refugees? Were they coming from Poland or Germany? No not from Poland or Germany. They usuall y came from Slovakia and Czechoslovakia and Romania. Those around us who passed by managed to escape an d they found a nice lodging in my home because my mother wa s always in the forefront of aiding the disadvantaged. So as children we listened to some of these ta les but there were not that many people who es caped and found their way to our home and how much do children believe; today there is television to show them what happens in Ethiopia and children star ving and all these horribl e things that are. But at least it's shown on TV. It is more believable . But then the kids go back to school and go and listen to their rock and roll music and figure it is far away, it's not where we are; it's not going to happen to us, we are human beings. Speaking of school what kind of schools did you attend? Can you tell us some thing about going to school in Kisvarda? Yes, there was a Jewish elementary school that my fam ily was not allowed to attend because my father was an anti-zionist. And they taught about zi onism in the Jewish school. It's kind of crazy. My father sent me to a non-Jewish school, the town elementary school,then we would go to junior high there. And it star ts somewhere early. We didn't go to gymnasium, but very few Jews attended the gymnasium and it wouldn't ha ve been people like my father 's children because he wouldn't allow us to go for that worldly education. Wo you kn ow it starts somewhere after Junior High and maybe it starts early enough, before eighteen. Fourteen or so? Probably there were some kind of courses that we were attending. I remember that one time Hungary was friends with Italy when Mussolini was still the good guy and there was something called Istituto Italiana di Cultura and we attended courses like that and there was a tremendous amount of self education and r eading and a tremendous amount at ho me and my mother's prompting and the kids all were very interested in all of the worldly matters and that ki nd of education went on in the home forever. Wh en my father went to America we were able to send Rachel to a more.... Rachel being your younger sister? My younger sister. My father was no longer there so my mother was able to send her to further schooling. I don't know how far she got but then when it came to my youngest sister, Potyo, it was the antisemitism. When Hitler came was at our doorste p I know that she was brutalized. Her school life was cut short wi th real brutality. I think she was thirteen and a half when she was killed. I think she was thirteen in January and she was ki lled in May in 1944. Bu t as she was going to school she was - I don't kn ow a year or two, sometime before they deported us I don't have the time frame - she developed the - what is this thing you get? Appendicitis? Appendicitis, and she had to be operated on. In those days an operation like that was a major event and you had to stay home at least six weeks after the operation. I don't know how long she was in the hospital but she had to be removed from school and had to have surgery. When she was at home recovering and was getting very lone ly and anxious to go back to sc hool and my mother went to her school. They refused her. She was not permitted to reenter school because she was out. Once she was out for that long time they got rid of her and that was another Jewish kid they got rid of and they don't have to take her back. She was no longer in th e school system. They refused to take her back and I remember the child su ffering enormously, pleading with my mother that she should go back to school and beg the principal to take he r back. She was lonely and she was not learning anything and all her friends were in school and it was a tragic time. In the end she wound up in Auschwitz and she never went back to school. But I reme mber it with great pain, how she suffered from not being allowed to reenter school. Now some of the other Jewish kids probably continued but this was a good way to get rid of another Jewish child. Th ere is lots to say about my sister Potyo who was truly a child of wa r, as we all were children of war, but none more than she was because she was really born into the war. She was 13 years old. I'm talking now about 1944 so she must have been born in 1931. Her name was? Her name was Helen but we called her Potyo that's some kind of endearing term for I don't know "the little one" The baby in the family? Yes, the baby in the family. And that's spelled? POTYO O with an umlaut [accent]. And she was a very beautiful child and different from the other children in my family. Hitler was riding high already when she was growing up and she didn't even know anything else than a life that is colore d by Hitler and his speeches and everything else. She was a different kind of child from the rest of us, tremendously se lf- centered and obviously a very intelligent child. You know I have great pain ta lking about her even now and by now she would be well over 50. She would be an old woman an d it would.... Over 50, that's not old. But to me she is that child, that beautiful 13 year old lean child who evidently knew nothing but fear and love in her - this enormous love for the family and this fear of what Hitler's era did to her and the war came. She was 9 years ol d when the war broke out and I can only think of her as fear and love and by fear i mean the fact that she was so terrified of bein g torn away from the family. She was already a tall little girl a normal not a little bit of a child, but a growing little child and she insisted on sleeping with my moth er. When my father left she al ways slept with my mother, but even when my father was home she wanted to sl eep with my mother be cause she was afraid. I remember I do not know if other members of my family remember her crying out in the middle of the night having terrible dreams and it was Hitler, something about Hitler. So this was a child of fear and love. The love of her family was enormous and I think her death might be somewhat the result of her wanting to be wi th her mother because I am sure that she hung onto my mother, wanted to go with her wherever she was going and sure enough Me ngele did ask her. From the accounts I heard from my sisters, my two sisters who were on their way to the crematorium because Mengela picked us out separately. He picked out Chicha and myself first and my older sister, Cipi, and Rachel kept going to the crematorium and th en Mengele turned aro und the group and made another selection. I think Rachel still to this day does not remember if it was Potyo or she who answered Mengele's question of "Du kleine, wie alt bist du?" and you little one, how old are you? And the indication was that he asked her for her age to cont emplate to pick her out. Had she said 15 he probably would have put her out to the life side but my sister R achel does not remember if it was the child who answered, Potyo, that she was only 13, not saying that I am 13 and a half but lying a half a year, or she, Rachel, said it; and that sentence haunted, has been haunting Rachel all her life and she still doesn't know if she said it or the child said it and she's never free of guilt and its been a terrible life for her because she ha s been suffering tremen dously. And Potyo want ed to go with my mother. Whether Potyo was killed with my mother in the crematorium or whether she was put in the open fire that they built in those days when the Hungarian Jews we re brought in. The crematoriums were working day and night in Auschwitz and they burned according to the Kapo who told us, who was there many years before. Sh e survived a number of years. Eventually she was killed also, but she told us that never had she seen in Auschw itz this kind [ph 510 homage] as when the Hungarian Jews were brought in. And whereas they used to burn 10,000 people a day they were burning 10 to 24,000 people a day and the crematoriums . I think there were 5 of them. Four or five of them were not proved sufficient en ough for the daily carnage so they built open fires and evidently Elie Wiesel saw some of these live children being thrown into the fires because there was no room in the crematoriums. And I am still haunted because I don't now if Potyo because she was a child was thrown alive into the open fire or if she wa s put into the crematorium but I do know this much that I saw the flames and I heard the shri eks and it was obvious that in addition to the fire that was burning in the crematoriums there was a nother fire to accommodate the extra world of the extra burden of Jews th at they felt had to be burned up so there was a lot of live burning. Do you recall the date? Oh yes it was May 31, 1944. Just a day after your birthday? No, we left Kisvarda on the May 29 and my birthday is on May 28 and that's the day we were packing for what they called the deportation and we didn't know what the he ll it meant, deportation. But we were packing ge tting ready for this. Who ordered you to pack? Who ordered us to pack? The sixteen year old SS who came into the ghetto of Ki svarda with a silver pistol and a dog. I guess a German Shepherd and this is the first time we saw the Germans because after that point Hitler marched into Hungary on March 19, 1944 Sunday afte rnoon then in quick succession because they have learned their ow n method of madness by then so well of how to kill Jews. First they started manually killing one by one then they developed these incredibly sophisticated ways of burning them and gassing them and burning them and a ll that, and by the time it came to Hungary what they starte d in 1939 what they started in Poland, let's say, ended up in Hungary as a push button system an d that's how they were able to desecrate the Hungarian Jewish population in a matter of three we eks I believe. 600,000 Hungarian Jews I believe, it was a highly developed system. But Hitler marched in on March 19 1944 and probably about fo ur weeks later, which was the day after Passover they allowed us to stay in our homes on Passover, for Passover, and the day after Passover we we re herded into the ghetto. By the Germans? By the Hungarians. By the Hungarians? By the Hungarian Gendarme s the most cruel creature s on the face of the eart h with their high hats and feathers and ri fles and shoulders. No Germans in Kisvarda yet? No. It was the Gendarmes - the I don't reme mber much activity by the policemen but I do remember the Gendarmes. I remember clearly two Gendarmes took ea ch family into the ghetto. They came to each home - two Genda rmes - and delivered th em into the ghetto with their fifty kilos on their backs. And we did not see the Germans. Evidently the machinery worked in such a way that the Germans had no authority on the fate of the Hung arian Jews until just before the deportation and then they seemed to co-mi ngle with the Gendarmes - the Gend armes and the Na zis, the SS. The first time we saw th e SS was on Sunday aftern oon May 28, 1944, on my birthday. And he came in with the Gendarmes and they lined up all of the ...I remember this beautiful sunny afternoon in May and we were ordered out of our cramped quar ters and I think in each courtyard they lined them up - I think the gendarmes did that and the ghetto police and people who worked in the ghetto in some kind of leader ship positions - and we were to a ppear in the courtyard and then the Nazi came and he announced each name. As he called out the names, the names that were called out had to move over to the other side. How did they know the names? The names were collected well in advance by the Jewish manageme nt -people evid ently the Nazis had dealt with from Budapest throughout th e country with this. They had various..... Did you have a council? Yea, they had a council I guess. How far back was this council set up? Oh this was after Hitler marched in but before we were taken to the ghetto because this was when we were in our home yet. And they had an actual census taker - one or two people assigned for these jobs. Whether they were paid jobs, I don't re member. But I know that they came to our home. They went to each home with a fo rm and they listed each person living in that home. So there was no escape from that. You couldn 't lie and say Mrs. Ka tz lives here but her children are not living here - everybody was listed. And they compiled this - it was a regular census taking of Jews. Only of Jews? Only of Jews, of course. And no one susp ected anything? Noone suspected anything. We knew that Hitler is doin g his things but what this would result in, we didn't know. This was another craziness that we had to comply with. And a lot of the orders prior to taking us to the ghetto were handed down to us by a town crier in the center of town, in the circle; the town crier with his drum and his little funny hat and his uniform with a very important air about him. He was an absolute idiot but he kne w how to tap this out and how to read enough to read the orders that came to him from Budapest or from the council, ce rtainly from the Nazi machinery. And he would read out these orders. Whether you were in the town square or not you had to know the orders. Not knowin g the law was no excuse of course like it isn't here either. The kids would run home and tell their parents that thes e were the new orders and all that and then an hour later he would appear again a nd give out new orders - Jews cannot have bicycles. You have to take them into the town hall. Jews can have no radios. This happened all the time and larger news came from the Fascist newspapers that we were sti ll able to purchase in which they what the Jewish star has to be made of - how many inches of the yellow star, wh ich side of the coat you have to wear it on. All of these things came from the news papers and then they were repeated by the town crier and the restrictions - ev ery minute something else - every hour something else. All of this was heralded through the radio while we still had the radio, before we had to turn it in - and the newspapers and the town cr ier. We were bombarded with it day and night. You had to move out of your home, didn't you? We did not have to move out of our home until they to ok us, until the two ge ndarmes came and took each family from the home and took us to the ghetto and then we ... So you lived outside of the ghetto? We lived on the main street in a perfectly beautiful home. And you weren't forced to move into the ghetto? Not for - it happened so fast. He marched in Ma rch 19. I don't know when Passover was then. April Well, we had our Passover at hom e and the day after Passover th e two gendarmes came to each home with the list. In this home in this addre ss these are the number of Jews who live. And we were given orders to take 50 kilos of our best clothing and best food. Of course which they confiscated immediately. Th ey made us bring our fine st clothes for the Germans. So you brought your best clothes? Oh absolutely. I remember what I was wearing when we boarded th e cattle car. I was wearing a beautiful big flowing cashmere coat with brown sued e platform shoes made to order. They were beautiful and I had a beautiful big handbag, beige, matching my coat. It wa s summer. It was May, it was hot but we didn't know wh ere we were going. We da red not take our best coat. They didn't tell you wh ere you were going? Deportation, to the east. Whatever that meant, we had no idea. Do you recall what your mother was wearing? I"m afraid I don't but it seems to me that she was wearing a wig usually, but this time she was wearing a kerchief on her head instead of wearin g a wig and I remember he r frantically shopping for last minute food. They had kept the Jewish food stores open until a minute before they took us away, ten o'clock in the morning or whenever they had to close the Jewish shops and I remember my mother sending me out to the store. That was very fancy, like a delicatessen kind of store right outside of our courtyard on the ma in street. And she sent me out for a quarter pound of butter or something and I remember how th e lady (by the way lived in our courtyard also, the people who owned the store, and they were very successful and it was a very elegant store.) She was counting the pennies how I paid for the butter. In that respec t it seems like insanity that I had to give every last penny that the butter was pr iced at because I gu ess she thought she wa s coming back. Of course, she was killed immediately. She was a young woman. Her husband and her two children, they were all murd ered immediately. And then the gendar mes came and rolled down the iron roller the way they used on the stores th ere. Shut the stores down. Bu t I remember my mother went out to the market. There was a marketplace where you wo uld buy live chickens, fr uits and all kinds of things while they were available. I clearly remember that my mother , a woman who came from such a religious background, we nt out to the market and bough t ham because she wanted her children to be well fed in the train on that trip going east b ecause there was no use trying to be kosher anymore. At least to her it was more important that her children should have some nourishing food than that it should be kosher. I'm not even sure that she ate it but I remember that she bought ham for us - so that we would have a ham sandwich on the train. We didn't know then that it was a cattle car. You expected to travel in a passenger coach? We had no idea because we didn't see these cattle cars before they pulled up. As a matter of fact we never saw them until they pulled up because we sat out at the railroad station on the sand. We were kind of lying down an d devastated by heat and thirst and th en we were guarded by Germans and the gendarmes and everyone with rifles and we just c ouldn't stand on our feet so we lay down on our backpacks. The insanity began but we didn't know what we were waiting for and we waited all the way till the afternoon. I think they took us away in the morning from the ghetto to the railroad station. We didn't know what we were waiting for. So we were at the railroad station but there were no cars yet. There were no trains. And then these cattle cars pulled up. That's what we were waiting for all day, evidently. And the cattle cars pulled up and they shoved us in and the little window in the cattle car was barred with iron bars and then we found ourselves 75 or maybe more standing in this cattle car like sardines. And then the fun began. This was when you were separated from your baggage at that point? No we were separated from the baggage - I am ta lking now about Kisvarda - we were not separated from our baggage until we arrived in Auschwitz. So the baggage went into the cattle cars with you? Yes and we were trying to sit on those baggages. I remember my mother was sitting against the wall, the far wall of the cattle car on these baggages that we had arranged for her and she was sitting there with my sister, Poty o, and my brother kind of laid down in front of her, he placed some other backpacks - it was 50 kilos each of us carried and he laid them down. But there was not enough room so he lay on top of that and we sat on top of him, so rt of. And of course there were no sanitary - there was some kind of a.... A barrel? It wasn't a barrel. It was someth ing smaller than that. That's wh at we used for a toilet and it was splashing all over A bedpan? It wasn't a bedpan. It was one of those big [kubel] 803 we used to call it, [kubel]. Then it was splashing all over. By this time the whole thing was out of this wo rld. People screaming, and I had my period and I couldn't cha nge my napkin, and people were dying already and going mad. Did anyone argue or resist in a ny way before getting on the train? I imagine the moment you saw these cattle cars, must have been a shock of some sort. We were surrounded by me n with rifles. They all wore ri fles, the SS had the ----------[814] those pistols. And all these aides, Hungarians and Ge rmans, they were all we aring rifles and we knew they shoot immediately. You know if your spine was crooked they'll shoot you. So you were too af raid to complain? Oh there was no way to oppose, to do anything because these we re not fighters. These were children and old people. The young men were all taken away long before into th e labor battalions. And these were all young people and women and ch ildren and old and sick. What were you going to fight with? Your entire family? The six of us. The six children and my mother. My father was already in America. But my brother did try, fought the best he could. He went over to the Nazi at one of the stops, when we were already choking because there was no air through that barred window, and he tried to make a deal with him to take off the bars so that more air woul d come in. I think that there was one at this end and one at the other end, I don't re member. And he tried to pry it I think with his hands apart to get some air. And as the train stopped he dared to go over to the Nazi and offer him so me kind of bribe and for some reason I seem to reme mber, but he could tell you this better, there was some kind of a scissors they needed, or something or other, I wish yo u would check with him. He gave them a scissors or something and then he didn't keep his promise. He was going to pry the window open but he didn't keep his promise. He took the scissors . I don't know if I'm te lling you the story right. It's something that you might want to check with him. But he fought to get us air, I know that. He fought as best as he could. And th e rest of us I guess want to stay alive until we finally arrive at this "east" place that we are deported to and where the families will be together we heard. And they will have good treatment. We will work for the war effort but we will be treated well. We heard these talks somewhere along that we will be treated well and work for the war effort and families will be together. So all we wanted to do is arrive at this precious place, you see, this east where we are deported to and the families will be together. So lets get this in sane trip over with because after this everything will be all right. An d after that, two days later, we arrived at someplace that said Auschwitz M[861]. And we had no idea what that meant. And then it all bega n, you know. Mengele and the crematoriums and the whole thing but you probably don't want to hear about that. You have enough of that. All over. My mother, I remember, sitting thr ough those two days from Monday afternoon through Wednesday afternoon. That's how long the trip took. She sat against that wall cuddling my little sister and her eyes were filled with perception of this thing that we are in and that we are going to and ther e was no question that she knew in her soul what is happening. She knew that this is the final roa d, the final trip, that th is will result in death. I don't know how she could have known there was a crem atorium or a gas chamber but in her soul it was obvious that she knew everything and there was only one prayer in her eyes as she kept looking at her children that they should survive this, that they should outlive this madness because there is a world out there that has humanity still locked in somewhere and this is a passing madness of a madman but there is goodness and there is dignity and there is life and there is purpos e and man has a mind with which he can create wondrous things and we should live up to those imag es in her head, those ideas that she had rather than what the mome nt is which is evidently the uglie st part of humanity and that we have to go beyond that and look for that in man which is noble and creative and good and has intellect of mind. All of these things were written in her eye. She spoke to us silently. She knew everything. I remember her having kind of a resigned look. I will not live but remember that there is so much to live for and you all should live for what can be not what is now here in fr ont of us. To me it was unmistakable that she never stopped transmitting these messages while she was rocking in that hideous cattle car. That car was jerking like this. I just have no doubt about it that she spoke to us all the time without saying anything. And I think her lega cy was heard by us and understood and in some mysterious way it added to the effo rt that we made to stay alive. Had we not come from such a noble heart as she ha d I don't know if we would have been ab le to make that kind of effort to survive. But there's no question that she handed down that legacy. Now you can say this about all mothers, that their love carried through those who survived and they remembered their mother's legacy. This is the way I have to talk about my mother because she had such largness in her heart. I can't put it any other way except that for two days she fed us her vision of a humanity that's greater than what Hitler has created. It seems like she had two visions, the vision of death and the vision of the triumph of humanity. She had the vision of her own li fe and the triumph of humanity. Was she the only person in your car to imagine that this was the end? No, I shouldn't think so. I don' t know if we saw it as the end. Remember we were young and healthy and not willing to bow our head to Hitler. There is the fight ing spirit for you. Determination? Yeah, we were not willing to accept Hitler as the last word. There is something else out there and we're going to destroy this Hitlerism, this Hitler world when we're free an d we can add our voice to those who create a better wo rld. And I guess we always tried. We heard. After all it's that spirit that moved me to wheel the stro ller through the Washington marc hes in the Vietna m days. I took both my kids, my husband and my two kids and we protested th e Vietnam war. It was that same spirit that we have to fight for a better world, and I fought. Were there discussions in the tr ain? Do you recall any discussions among the vari ous families? You probably knew some of the other people. There was no way to get to anybody. No, within your cattle car. Yes but within the cattle car there was no way to move to the other end of the cattle car so we were in this spot, in this tiny little spot, the seven of us and you couldn't even go to the left or to the right. There was no room. But you recognized some of the other people? I don't remember anybody or anything. I only remember this little group huddled together trying to make it through the night. Very little talking? Remember the clatte ring of the cattle car is very noisy. Prayers? I don't remember praying. I' m sure people were praying but I remember hearing screams and nightmarish screams of all kinds. People were going ma d and people were dyi ng, and the moans of the sick. Who can ever describe th at kind of ride. You know it is very hard to tell after so many years but I think we were focused in on my mother's soul and that soul must have been incessantly feeding us messages of life , not death. That's how I see it. You will talk to my brother and I don't know what he will say but this is my inner interpretation of that trip. No, we didn't see anybody. It was dark, wasn't it? Of course it was dark. You had no windows. No light. Who could hear from the scream s and the tremendous noise of the rattling of the cars. You couldn't hear your own voice . You could only hear your inner voice which gave you a mandate to live or end it right here - let me die or go on. Philip was an extraordinary force of strength. He was all of 19 or 20, 21 and he knew that he was the man in the family that he's responsible as like he was the father of these six women. He was just great. He always has been. He is still the father of us all. He is treating us as if we are his children an d that my mother or dered him to shield her children. And he was shieldi ng us all the time and he tried. How he ma naged to talk to the Nazis, I don't know, but he trie d to do some kind of negotiation. His story might be entirely different than mine but these ar e my inner interpretations of wh at my mother was and my baby sister who couldn't breathe. Probably wouldn't le t her finger go. She must have held on to my mother with her entire body and everything within her. My older sister, Cipi she was one of these suffering mo re grown children because there were only the two little ones and my brother who was shielding ever ybody and then there were the three grown girls and she had the bewildered protective look about he r if I can remember. But she wa s very protective also, always. She was a very good-hearted woman who had a tendency to speak first and think about it later. But the first instinct was always good - to be good. I reme mber when somebody ca me into our house as they often did, the gypsy lady wh o had nine [ph] 1048 million ki ds and she woul d come to my mother and say my children are hu ngry and my mother would pack things in her potato sack that she came with. My older sister had a tremendous amount of goodness in he r. I really remember one Friday the lady came from a very poverty ridden area of to wn - a Jewish woman and said that it's already Friday afternoon and sh e doesn't have fish or chicken or largeness (shabbat bread). She doesn't have it because she doesn't ha ve a penny and it's getting too la te in the afternoon and she still doesn't have anything for the shabbat. They were so religious that even if they had someth ing on shabbat they wouldn 't cook it so it had to be Friday afternoon. And I clearly remember that my older sister ha d a gold ring with her name in it. I don't remember what they called it but it was very fashionable in those days that you would have a ring with a kind of circle here and your name was imprinte d in it and she had this gold ring that she's gotten for a birthday or something or othe r and when she heard this lady come and cry that her children are hungry, she doesn't have anything for the shabbat, she just took off her ring and gave it to the woman. She was extremely good-hearted an d she acted upon the first impulse. She thought about it later but she would always act im mediately and some of her acts were acts of native goodness. I was so focused in on my little sister that outside of the strength of my sister Chicha who after all is responsible for our survival, there is no question ab out that. I reme mber her for her strength and I remember my brother for his bigness not even all of this wo rld but also of another world of great ideals, goodnesses. I was duly focused in on the little one most but I remember my older sister. There was always so me kind of envy because she had the best clothes and she was the one to be married off and she wa s very elegant and very well ke pt and you had to pay homage to this older sister always. How old was she? She must have been 26, 27, 28, someth ing like that. She was a grown woman. But not married? Not married because there were no men around. They were all in the Munkaszolgalat, the labor battalion. But I remember her most for her determin ation to live. She was the one, of course, who didn't survive but I clearly remember in the second camp, not in Auschwitz but in Birnbaumel when she was wearing this blanket, some kind of blanket that we had and we tore to pieces and each one wore another part of the blanke t or sometimes we had a whole bl anket and she was bundled up in this blanket, frozen to death in the January snow and frost of Eastern Germany wh ich is like the North Pole. I just remember her standing with that blanket on, weighing prob ably 50 pounds, a frozen skeleton that's still alive. She said to me armless, legless, but I want to survive. Even if my arms freeze off and my legs freeze off, no matter how much of me is left , I want to live, I want to survive. It made a tremendous impression on me becaus e I didn't think of her as deat h. I thought that she would be more depressed because I remember at one time that she had a failed love story where one of these men who came to my town with this labor battalion and she was in love with one of them and then they took him away. The w hole thing busted and she was terribly depressed. This was when we were still at home. She felt like life was not worth living without him. I don't remember his name. But she looked like she just doesn't think life is worth living without him. I remember I was surprised she was so tremendously pro-life, how she wanted to live, even if only part of her is whole. And she's the one who didn't make it. That much ca n be said for determination and human spirit. It's just another indication that there is absolutely no way to tell - you cannot tell what made one survive. There ar e no rules to this ga me that can be detected by any normal human being and while psychiatrists make these idiotic utterances that survivors guilt I am supposed to be feeling. On top of ever ything I carry in my battered heart I am supposed to be feeling guilty for surviving. Survivors' guilt. I have never yet been able to co nsciously put my finger on that pr onouncement because I feel guilty about everything I do today; if I say a cross word to my husband, if I mistreat my children, if I insult anybody, if I'm not kind, if I'm not sensitive and Gd knows I am sure I do th ose things. I feel very guilty about those things but I have never consciou sly felt guilty about surviv ing. When I hear these learned pronouncements and these ps ychiatrists seem to know so we ll why we survived and how we survived and what we feel and all that. What comes to mind is always what Golda Meir said once, I heard her on television, who said that she feels guilty not because I didn't do everything within my power but because I wa sn't there. So I was ther e. I have no reason to feel guilty. If there is a survivors' guilt, it's mysterious to me. Maybe they know something that I don't know but I didn't kill six million people. You didn't kill anybody. I didn't kill anybody. I didn't kill my mother. I didn't send my family to the crem atorium. Hitler did. I can't see why I feel guilty. I feel guilt y about all kinds of other things. I think I feel very guilty about the fact that what this whole experience left me with is that I may have treated my children in the way not other people treat their ch ildren but with more wo rrying, more caution, and infinitely more anxiety than norm al parents who have not had my ex perience. I think that in that sense I have victimized my chil dren. I think there is no question in my mind that children of survivors are deeply wounded by th e experiences of their parents and they refuse to admit it but this tremendous drive to excel, nothing less than Harvard would do for some of them is always making up for the pain and deprivation that the parents have experienced. I think our children are in some ways more sensitive because of the tales that the pa rents have told them but it's a very complicated issue of guilt between the parent and the child. Th ey feel guilty for what ha ppened not out of their volition. It's not their fa ult, but what happened to their parent was something far more gruesome than happened to any other parent unless in individual cases they ha ve hideous experiences. But on the whole their parents have experienced horrendous gruesomeness in life. Two really great victims of this outside of those of us who survived - because those who perished are no longer even victims, they're just nothing anymore, bu t we are the living victims. I thought the two really innocent victims are our children and their children - th e perpetrators - the Nazis whose children and grandchildren have to live with this knowledge though they don't know anything usually because their parents won't tell them. But they suspect it. Maybe my father is a murderer. And which child wants to be fathered by a murderer. Afraid to ask, they don't get any answer s. Generally, I suppose that's what happens. And I used to say that they're the true vict ims, those childre n and ours. And then I've had quite a number of terrible experiences with German children and I stopped saying that and I say it's only our children who are the real victims. It's not quite true probably because there are probably a lot of se nsitive German kids who are suffering tremendously. But I had two or three lousy experiences, so I stopped saying it. I just focus in on the fact that our children are terribly punished emotionally by being truly the extension of Auschwitz because wh en we are gone, long after we are gone, when none of us will be left, perhap s decades later, these children will be the nearest thing that you can touch that is connected to Ausc hwitz. It is them they will ask how was it to grow up with a mother who wa s a survivor of Auschwitz. You know I'm talking 50 years from now. I expect that our children should live longer than we live in our age. But you know, 20, 30, 40 years from now there will be nothing as comnmonly visible as it is today that you can find a survivor here and there. So they will be the ne arest link to the reality of Auschwitz. I don't envy them. As a matter of fact I have noticed in some of these gatherin g that we have had in Israel, in Washington, in Philadelphia , the survivors, that the media was kind of wise to that reality because I have noticed how they go after our child ren rather than us. It's as if we were already gone and let's better ask those who will be here w ith us for a long time, their children. Who knows what it is to be the child of such a person. I want to hop back to some of the antisemitism th at I grew up with that was really mother's milk to me. Being a Jewish girl in a Hungarian school in l933? Yes. First of all I had to be sort of the best student because I was this terri ble minority of one or two there. I think there were two of us in the cl ass who were Jewish. So I had to be the best student. So was my friend. We were both extraordinary students. Jewish friend. This Jewish friend of mine. Did you have any non-Jewish friends in this class? None that I could trust. I might have had so me superficial friends. I might have had, but I remember this one. Leah, I don' t remember - something like that - was her name but her second name was Halpert I think an d her father was equally... Not related to you Halpert? No, not at all. But her father wa s so terribly religious, as mine, and did not want her to go to a Jewish school which would teach he r something about Zionism so sh e was very bright and she was a good friend of mine and she wa s decent and darling and intelligent and the two of us just simply had to be the best students. Bu t you couldn't win because you had to be the best student because you were such a minority and if you were the best student they hated your guts because you were just a damn Jew who was sm arter than the next guy. Was this all girls? No, it was a mixed class. Boys and girls. Yeah. These very same kids that I was in school in the afternoon if I walked out later in the street, I just heard them say, "Dirty Jews, dirty Jews, dirty Jews." You can't be a winner which is what I apply as well to the fact that we cannot win this ugly reality of our life that we are survivors of this madness because vis-a-vis our childre n. We cannot win be cause so many of us have shielded them from Auschwitz. We did not want to tell them anyt hing about it. So there were those parents. And they were losers be cause the kids came back at them. Why didn't you te ll me? I know my niece did and so did others. I had told them and my husband was ve ry helpful and tried to impart some of the information because they we re seeking it out. But I must tell you they wanted to know it and they didn't. Early in their lives they were already torn by conflicts because they wanted to know so much but they did not want to know so much. I clearly remember when my ch ildren were going to school, this Fieldstone we just mentioned, and we were walking di stance from the sc hool. We lived in over there. I remember my older one Peter who said one morning, "M ommy, how did my aunt die?", referring to Potyo. They h eard that maybe she died in an open fire alive they threw her in. Mommy how did my aunt di e, Potyo? And I realized that as he asked me the que stion he had his hand on the knob. He was opening the door to leave for school. So he wants to know but he didn't really want to know and he left without finding out. But this te rrible conflict was already imbedded in there at such an early age so the end result is that there are no winners in imparting the knowledge or not. Those of us who did lost in a sense and those of us who didn't lost. There's no way to win something as big as this, you cannot. I would imagine too that you foun d it difficult to think of Potyo as an aunt, thirteen years old. Clearly, sure. That's a very good point. As a matter of fact when I was saying aunt I was wondering who I was talking about because she was just a child. But indeed she was my children's aunt. And would have been a lovely wo nderful aunt of some fifty odd years. Not to mention a beautiful wife and a great mother. And a mother herself, yeah. There's not even any point to talk about th at. But in that same vein as I mentioned some further antisemitic winds that I got - In Hungary? Yeah, I must tell you the story that pained us, or pained me, I don't know if the others know it the same way. But the way I know the story of my two brothers, twins, their names were Shmuel and Barry. Barry? Could you spell it, please. I don't know how you would spell it but it was Beryl and Shmuel. That would be th e Yiddish name. Would that be Samuel? Sam would sound right and maybe Bernard. But I don't remember their non-Jewish names though they had them because they had to be registered by their non-Jewish names. So you had three brothers, then? I originally had three brothers. I don't remember - it seems to me yes, they were born before Potyo. They would come between Rachel and Portyo. They were not iden tical twins. They were two delicate little boys that I remember in their swa ddling clothes. I didn't know about this because something evidently happened and they shipped us away from home and they sent us to my grandmother in Nyiregyhaza. When we came back we found that we only had one brother out of the twins left. My mother was kind of totally dest royed. And they were telling us that we came home because something terrible had happened bu t we're going back to my grandm other and then we're going to come back home again. They sent us back and we didn't come back agai n because something terrib le happened again and what happened was that the twins had a wet nurse and the wet nurse's child got ill with some kind of lung inflammation of some sort - I don't know what it was, maybe TB for a ll I know - but her milk was infected with whatever this was and her child recovered. She was breast-feeding the three children. Her child got ill and recovered and our two children got very ill. My parents had a philosophy in life when somethi ng is wrong, when somebody is ill , you seek out the best possible care at any cost or any religion or any anti-semitism, no matter what it is you will get the very best care. So you go to the most famous man in the field. The mo st famous man in th e field, evidently, was in this children's hospital which was very famous in the country, in Debrecen which was near the town where my mo ther was born. My mother and father immediately took the children to this hospital. One died and my mother came home, I think, to sit shiva. You know what th at is, I think. After the dead, you have to sit for a week on the floor, and that sort of thing. It was the time before the child died that they sh ipped us off to my grandpa rents. She evidently left the other child there ill in Debrecen. And I guess left the other child there and a week later or so the other child died as well. And somebody, I don't remember who, told us that when the other child died my mother left the hospital and charged out to th e street absolutely crazed. She was screaming. She was totally crazed by it. And then sh e came home and fina lly we heard the story of what happened and she was absolutely convinced or she had facts, I don't know, because con ceivably she had friends. My mother was a very social person to whom people talk ed. She had real friends. In any field, people she touched trusted her and confided in her and everything. So I su ppose she must have heard this from other doctors, young doctors, perhaps Jewish do ctors, colleagues of - ther e were a lot of people involved evidently in the two cas es of death of these children. And my mother was absolutely certain that the children were victims of antise mitism; that they had experimented on them and treated them as Jewish children, not necessarily to be saved, but to learn from. And that they were sacrificial lambs. She ne ver recanted on that. She maintained fo rever that the children were victims of anti-semitism. Back in those years, which goes way back, I do n't remember when those children were born, but this was before Hitler. But curiously the place, the hospital, was known for a sense of anti-semitism. So it wasn't he r imagination. She either had proof of it because th ey were twins that they were a subject for experimentation. How old were they? They were eight months old when th ey died, within two, three weeks of each other. Of course my parents could never be consoled and that's how Philip remained the only son after th at. My mother's instincts were to be trusted on the whole in all of the big issues. One for instance which stan ds out in my mind always - I sort of cannot live it down. In a sense it does add to my pessimism wh ich my family will testify that despite the fact that I show strength and have survived and all that - I am a afflicted with a sense of pessimism. And G-d knows at this stage, I have enough to be pessimistic about, all of us, because the world is taking from bad turn - always seems to be making worse turns than last time and G-d knows what will become of the world now. Antisemitism rising everywhere in the world. So there is enough cause not only to be skeptical but to feel deeply sad abou t the state of the world and particularly in regard to anti-semitism and I always thought I should be invo lved in the activity of leaving something behind for future generations about this whole event of the holocaust because I was there, I' m a first hand person, I have a certain responsibility to leave the truth behind. I have done it very much at my own expense and undoubtedly at the expense of my children and my husband. I paid very dearly. They pay very dearly for what I have done in or der to leave enough of the truth be hind so that when the revisionists make even bigger noises than th ey have made all thro ughout these years after my survival, our testimonies will be there so that we can counteract their evil pronouncements regarding the holocaust. The holocaust never happened. Do you believe in G-d, Isabella? No. I have had tremendous tro uble with the question of G-d because I never saw him when I needed him and I really have ques tions only. I have absolutely no answers to any of them. How can I have any answer to them when I rememb er standing in Auschwitz on a summer day when evidently planes were flying over head - probably those were the pl anes that were going to takes pictures of the Krupp [Buna] installments. Those ar e the pictures they have of Auschwitz itself. The allies have had those pictures and they didn 't bomb Auschwitz, as we know now. They didn't bomb the rails. It must have be en those planes that flew overh ead that we saw way up there. Whichever planes they were, I re member standing in Au schwitz in Lager C on a very hot summer afternoon in 1944 and as the planes flew overhe ad raising my hands in pr ayer saying G-d, please let them kill us with their bombs. I'd rather die by the bombs of the west or the fighting forces or whatever I might have said - I don't remember - but I'd rather die by the bombs than let Hitler have the joy of killing me in the crematorium. I don't want him to have the last word. I really wanted to die. There was no way out. Cert ainly there was no way to imagine that I'm ever going to survive that. Since I have no other fate except dying, why shoul dn't I die by the bomb s. And the planes flew over us and never bom bed us. It was only this much that I asked of th at almighty G-d in those circumstances and I wasn't grante d this much. I cannot gi ve you an answer on the question of G-d because I will as long as I live ask where he was hiding when they burned 24,000 people a day in Auschwitz and we, the few survivors, had to live wi th the stench of 24,000 people burning a day. Even G-d has to forg ive me for asking this question. Where is an answ er? Give me an answer to that question. Where was G-d when the smoke was so thick, so gray, so dark. There was no sky. There was nothing blue to be seen on some days. Nothin g but smoke around the clock. My children throughout the years have be en very conscious of thick smoke. I remember riding along in the car with my question via New Jersey and there would be a big fire in these - I don't know where they keep these gasoline tanks or something... The oil refineries. Yeah, all kinds of fires and as soon as the thick smoke appear ed, my children look ed frightened, and looking at me and looking at the smoke and trying to find out what's going on inside me because I see the smoke that I used to speak of and my children were frighten ed for their mother to see smoke because it reminded her of the burning mother. If it could remind them, it certainly reminded you. You can imagine. So is that a way for children to grow up? And then I can ask, "Where is G-d? Why doesn't he protect my children from having these terrible feelings?" And you were brought up as a religious girl. And I was brought up in a very relig ious home and I cannot answer your questions nor anybody's. I don't know what to do. A religious girl who was forced to attend the public school because of her father's religion. And coming from a long line of rabb inical background. I am sure th at in my mother's side, I have nothing but rabbis as great great great great great grandfathers. I"m sure that that's the whole lineage - is rabbinical. But I welc ome any of my ancestors to send me a supernatural message if you will about the question of G-d and Auschwitz. Under norma l circumstances I perhaps would not have had to question. Who helped you survive, if anyone? My sister. My good sister. I go back to Chicha but I must tell you about my pessimism I started out with. My mother was so accura te in her pessimistic outlook vis-a-vis Jewish survival. She was also optimistic, remember? Yes, because she hoped that her children would live and she expected them to live. But my mother, throughout the war years while Hitler was making his big noises and big moves and was dancing all over our graves all over Europe, even before the wa r broke out in the 30s wh en I was old enough to remember, my mother used to say (all the time I heard this) Hitler will lose the war (there was no war yet) - Hitler will lose the war but he will win it against the Jews. Nobody put it more accurately, more astutely than she and she fed our young minds with this absolute truth. She proved to be absolutely right. And she had this submission that could not be placated by any kind of foolish talk ab out what Hitler will turn out to be. Is this when you decided to seek visas to leave Hungary? No, my father had co me to America on a business trip in 1936 in connect ion with the World's Fair. 1936? I think it was '36. '39 I know there was a Wo rld's Fair in New York. Yeah, but he must have come earlier to make a rrangements for a Hungarian wine pavilion. He was a wine and liquor wholes ale merchant. He came to America to make arrangements for a pavilion and one of the Hungarian ministers (I understand from my brother an d he can give you the accurate name) made a comment afte r they issued the necessa ry papers to him. He was quoted as saying, "It's a dirty shame that a G-d-damn Jew should repr esent us on the World's Fair." Antisemitism was in the highest places and lo west places an d everywhere. Your father heard this? Well the quote was hand ed down to us enou gh so that my brother rememb ers it very accurately. He remembers the name of th e Hungarian official, some very high of ficial. In any event, my father came early before the World's Fair to make arrangements for a Hungarian pavili on and he returned within ten days to Hungary. He came on a visitor's visa and he returned. In those days, anyone who came to America would never drea m of returning. They came as visitors, whichever way they came, they stayed here. That's all they wanted was to escape those poverty-ri dden lands of Poland, and Hungary and all of them. My father was the only one who retu rned. And because he returned within ten days and he came back because it was Pa ssover and he had to be ho me for the seder. The American consul trusted him so much because he was a weird person to re turn from America that when he came to ask for another vi sa they just issued it to him w ith no questions asked. He was very trustworthy. So he finally went back to ge t a visa because my mother urged him to save his family and go to America. My mother saw this very early. Was this after the ou tbreak of the war? No, before the outbreak of the war. Hitler was already too powerful and my mother was too frightened. He got the visa and he had the visa in his breast pocket. People were offering him all kind of monies to buy the visa off him and somehow convert it to their own names or picture or whatever it was. My fath er of course wouldn't give up the visa but at the same time he refused to come back to America becau se he kept saying that America is not the kind of place - you don't want to bring up Jewish children ther e - they have people from all over the world - there is not enough Yiddishkeit, Jewishness and religiosity. I think now there seems to be a lot more of surges of Jewishness and religiosity. These kids going around with their sku ll caps and everything. There's a lot going on that's very Jewish c onsciousness. I welcome that. But he was afraid that if he brings his family here his children would not be Jewish enough. They will absorb too much of Americanism rather than Judaism. He was reluct ant to come back. My mother constantly urged him - you must save our ch ildren. You must go back. Finally he agreed to come to save his family. He came back and arrived with pr obably the last boat that brought him here. The war had already broken out. Courtesy of the great Franklin Dela no Roosevelt who was such a great president. He didn't have a Jewish soul. He didn't want to save the Jews. He wa nted to win the war. The Jews were not uppermost in his mind and we know now he refused to bomb the Auschwit z rails and he did too much that was terri bly, terribly wrong. One of those thin gs was that when a Jew such as my father from Hungary who wa s already in this country and applying for his papers to remain here to eventually become a citizen, and aske d for papers to bring over his family of se ven so at least they could save those seven people from Hitler's murder . He, I understand, spen t all his waking hours knocking on the doors in Washingt on at the various authorities - give me the pa pers - give me the papers - save my children. And th ey managed to postpone it long enou gh so that by the time they would give him the papers, Hungary had declared war against the United States. Witness the beginning of the statement I said that on December 7... Yes, I recall. So two years to get papers? They dilly-dallied. They would have had to give him the papers immediately. Let's save one Jewish family. There is some legitimacy he re because the father came here for that purpose and some of us were underage and co uld have come under his auspices. They managed to sabotage this Jewish family and they managed to sabotage all of the efforts to save Jews. This is not my story but it is well documented in G-d knows how many books. So Hungary declar ed war against the United States and there was no American consulate because we were allies of Hitler. So were the Japanese. The whole thing was aborted. So then my father eviden tly spent another year and a half or two years - 41 until 44, I guess - to try to get papers to come to Israel since the American plan didn't work. So he was knocking on the doors - get me pape rs to go to Palestine. British-controlled Palestine. Yeah. And he was desperate. Da y and night he worked to get them papers to go to Palestine because America was out of the question. And he finall y succeeded again with so much postponement from these gentle souls who were not in terested in saving at least one Jewish family. By the time we got the papers, Hitler had occupied Hungary and I remember the papers had arrived and there they were - seven documents to get this family to Is rael and Naziism was already in full force in Hungary. I always say I don't know what we used it for, toilet paper or what, but it was worthless. And instead of going to America or to Palestine ...... How did you finally escape? I never mentioned to you that Phili p, my brother, was to rn away from us immediately in Auschwitz but his last plea to us - actually it was a very dramatic and very unus ual act of defiance on his part - that when men and women were sepa rated and we made it to the life side and we were led into this huge wet monstrous place where they shaved us and threw a rag at us in La ger C - no it probably wasn't Lager C - and we saw two other monsters - this was Chicha and I - and we saw two other shaved monsters in rags who we barely recognized, but they looked famili ar and these are our two sisters whom Mengele was original ly leading to the crematorium a nd then he changed his mind and took them out to the life side. As we were shav ed and looking absolutely hideous some kind of a magic force appeared--my brot her Philip who by now was wearin g a striped uniform. He was shaved and evidently his group was re ady to be led to the camp where they were going to lead them - whether it was A or B or wherever they led the men. Evidently he kept looking for his sisters and he knew already that his mother was no longer alive. There was somebody wh o shaved him and he was evidently a prisoner in Auschwitz who was one of the people who sh aved him and it was somebody he knew. He co uld tell you more about this. And he said to him that your mother is already dead, or something about th e smoke that there is your mother . My brother evidently passed down the word to the othe rs, to the next gu y and the next guy. Tell them to say kaddish. We no longer have parents. He was evidently looking for whatever was left of his family hoping that the girls, because they are young and healthy, that they are on the life side and he kept peering through this window and this incredibly brave human being, despite th e Nazis all around, managed to climb through that window becaus e he saw us and he flew into the wi ndow. How he did that I don't think he knows. And he put his arm ar ound these four naked-headed mons ters, his sisters. And he shook us and he said, "Listen to me! Eat! Eat everything they give you. If they give you shit, eat shit, but you must survive. We must live. We must pay them back and create a better world." And he flew out. He was back throug h the window and he was gone. We never saw him again until we were in America. But he managed to - talk ing about resistance, what this ma n did, we never ever forgot - I don't know if he remembers the wo rds he said to us. I clearly remember them as these words. How the others remember them , I don't know. These ar e the words I remember and whenever it looked like we were finished, there is no more life left in us, somehow this vision came up of Philip saying you must eat no matter what they give you because we mu st survive. And then for three weeks he was evidently in Auschwitz. He was the most ingenious pub lic relations man or communication man probably in the world because he found pieces of wood in his camp because they were still building the camp and there were pieces of wood. He somehow managed to barter his bread probably to a prisoner who had been there longer and probably had a little chunk of a pencil. He carved every day on a piece of wood - you must live, you must live, you must survive. And he would say on that, my sisters are in Lager C. Their name is Katz. Whoever finds this piece of wood please toss it over the next camp, Lager they called it, until it reaches Lager C. And these band of resisters, these prisoners, managed to thro w it over the wire, Lager to Lager, until it reached Lager C. And we got the message ev ery single day for about three weeks. Who would catch it? Somebody would find it in th e same spot the same way and we would go there looking for it because by now we were trained. It was a secret language of the most power ful underground communication in the world and we found the piece of wo od or somebody brou ght it to us because by this time they knew us so there were some people who kne w us. They brought us this life message and then one day it stopped and then we we re certain that he is up in smoke or Mengele took him to another camp. We never heard from him again until we arrived in America. An American soldier found hi m in a hospital and wrote to my father becaus e the only thing - we didn't have any belongings - the only thing we were all schooled in at home, by my mother, I guess, or by each other, that if we ever live d through this war, we should rememb er one thing - my father's address, l66 Ross Street, Brooklyn , where my aunt lived, and my father lived with his sister. And that's what we reme mbered, this address. Th at was the only document we had, that wa s the only paper, which was not a pape r. It was in our head, engraved, 166 Ross Street. He gave this address to the American soldier who liberated him. He found him in a hospital with a bullet in his leg. He was in six concentration camps while we were in two. He tried to escape, after he tried to make a deal with the Nazi who he caught changing his clothes, I believe, be cause he wanted to escape when the Americans were so near that they were overhead and they were in the cattle cars shipping them further into Nazidom. But this is something he would have to tell you. Bu t in any event he shot him in the leg . He didn't want to kill him, it looks like, but he shot him in the leg and this American soldier found him in the hospital. We didn't know anything about him, this whole saga of six concentration camps and the bullet until he arrived in January 1945. I will return to how we survived. When Auschwitz was be ginning to be liquidated in the fall of 1944, we spent all our energies - whatever was left in our 40 to 50 pound hu man being that we each weighed, 40, 50, 60 pounds, and I had typhus throughout the nine months that I was in the camps, whatever energy we had we spent it on only one thing - to run away from Me ngele's selections, because if Mengele will select the four of us, one would go to another camp, one would go to the crematorium, one would go yet to another camp, one would stay here. We cannot afford a se lection if we s till want to be four sisters. We were a rather large family. There was another family who had six sisters. We were probably the next largest because they were decimated. Families were totally decimated. Because we were close in age, young and healthy, he picked us out. So the four of us made it all the way through six months of Ausc hwitz in the worst times of Auschwitz and escaped Mengele's selection even if we had to run, as we did one night, and he shot after us , but he didn't get us in the dark. So we remained alive. We tried anything and everything to remain together. We made it sort of to the entrance to the crematorium where they were going to take us out of Lager C in November on a bitter co ld night and put us in the crematorium and then as it happened so many times we were unable to figure out what they were going to do and they changed the orders once more. Instead of putting us in the crematorium, they put us on trains, on ice-cold trains, with heated cars for th e Nazis and ours were ice-cold. They took us to another concentration camp called Birnbaumel, or that's the way I remember the name, in Eastern Germany. We trav eled, I don't know how long , frozen to death and st arved. We arrived in a place called Birnbaumel where they had a thousand prisoners in a forest in umbrella-like paper-thin wood structures with no floor. It was only ice. The walls were ice and the floor was ice. It was eastern Germany in a forest. What were you wearing? Rags. Chicha was wearing a wood en shoe and one regular shoe. The only thing they let us keep were eyeglasses and shoes and the shoes wore out and somehow all kinds of wooden clogs appeared. My sister had one wo oden shoe and one regular shoe. Coats, blankets? Rags and whatever we could some how manage to - maybe they gave us something or we bartered something. We had a lit tle more clothing than we had in Auschwitz but certainly not enough to keep you warm in the fore st. Every morning we had to go to the other end of the forest through the town where all the Germans saw us. They said they never saw us . They were going to work and to school. Twice a day they saw us coming and going. They had to stop traffic for a thousand of wretched skeletons to walk through the town to reach the other end of the forest to do Schatzarbeit [Schutzarbeit ] digging ditches for the tank traps. In the frozen earth, if we wanted to start digging, we had to heat up the earth firs t because the earth was frozen. The Germans stood there with their incredible coats and uniforms and ri fles and they would warm their fat rumps at the fire and they would chase us away with the butt of their rifles because heat the earth, not the Jews, you know. This went on all winter from No vember to January and we got thinner and fra iler and sicker and my typhus was raging. How I didn't di e, I never know. I had typhus fo r nine months. The doctor said under the best of care at home I would have died in days. Fi nally after digging the bloody German earth and watching how the Nazis were so gentle with their murder ous dogs and what they did to us. Finally the end came. We were in Birnbaumel in these icy huts and on a Sunday afternoon on January 21, they gathered us in a tremendous hurry. The word was always los, los, schnell, schnell, fast, fast, whatever the hell it meant. We had to line up in funferreih always five in a row. They counted us and within minutes they marched us out of the camp. Had we hidden then, which we didn't know, had we hidden anywhe re, they had no time to come looking for us and the people who were in the so called hospital which was called the Revier with their legs frozen off and they had gangrene and they couldn't take th em out and they didn't want to shoot them because they didn't want to leave the evidence behind - dead bodies. Those people were the ones who su rvived because if we had hidden anywhere we would have been lib erated that very after noon because the Russians were that close but we didn't know anything about that. We only knew that we ha d to go very fast - run, line up, and march out of the camp. We were out on the road on Sunday afternoon, bitter, bitter cold, snow and ice al l over and we had to march fast and fast and faster. We we re led out of the camp and we were marching towards the west wher e Hitler was ostensibly ruling. We didn't know where we were going. We marched until the evening. In the evening they had put us up in another evacuated camp where a thousand girls had been take n out of. We spent the night there and that was Sunday night and Monday we marched another day in these hideous conditions. Rachel was coughing. It sounded like she had TB. It was terrible. But the four of us were still together. Tuesday morning we trie d to fight back again. One night we were h oused in an evacuated concentration camp an d the second night they put us up in several barns. The cows were in one barn and the straw and their bedding, I guess, was in another barn and we gathered enough strength, inner and physical strength, to try to make it once more an d we hid ourselves in the straw, on the top level. We thought if they come with their pitchf orks to drive us out of our hiding place well then that's the way we'll die bu t let's try it anyhow. We successfully hid ourselves. Several other people had done the same thing. They had no time to pitchfork us out of the hiding place s. They knew that some of us must have b een hiding in these straw refuges. Cunni ngly, as always, they began to boil potatoes. It's not that they wanted to feed us but the smell would lure us out from the hiding place and that's exactly what it did. The four of us who struggle d so hard to remain four together gave up our hiding place because the smell of potato was irre sistible. To eat once more was more important than perhaps freedom and we volu ntarily gave up our hiding place a nd lined up for the potatoes, the four of us together with the others. By the time we re ached the kettle in which they were boiling the potatoes, there were none. Th ey were all gone. But by no w we were prisoners again. How did you get away now? This was Tuesday morning. Sunday we slept in the camp and Monday we slept in the barn and Tuesday morning on the 23rd, we were prisoners again, and we lined up and we marche d again. By this time a great many girl s had died and anyone who couldn't march was shot right there. It was Tuesday morning, I don't kn ow what hour it was, late morning probably, they were marching us. We were in this town called Jaga dschutz and there were three sister s in the back of us who escaped so the guards who were in the back guarding us in this marching line and the guards on the two sides went all back to shoot two girls, as we late r found out, and the third on e had to dig a grave for the two sisters. Only the guar d in the front remained. My sister Chicha, who was the heroine always, was at the end of the line as we entered this little village called Jagadschutz. There was a little house of a blacksmith and she had enough presence to figure out that if no smoke is coming out of the chimney - they didn't ha ve any sophisticated fi re, heating arrangements - if no smoke is coming out then they mu st be gone. They mu st have escaped from the oncoming liberators, whoever they were - Americans or Russians or w ho knows what; we didn't know anything about the status of the war. Bu t they have escaped evid ently and she bolted and ran out. She had made another attempt to escape but by th is time we agreed that ostensib ly we're not going to be aiding each other in the same way as we always did. There was no question that we were always going to do the same thing. This time we said somebody has to survive. Whoever can, let's make it. So she bolted and she ran into the little house and she ran up to the stairs. Nobody was in there. It was ice cold. She went up to the attic. Rachel was marching right next to her and she ran. Nobody looked back. Nobody said anythin g. I saw Rachel and I ran and I was certa in that Cipi standing next to me would do exactly the same thing. Rachel and I ran into a little dogh ouse. The dog was gone. They took the dog away. We hid in th e doghouse crouched. Su ddenly in this deadly silence and snow and it was a snowstorm but it was beautiful, white, it was Christmas time like Christmas time, peace on earth, good will toward s men. We were crouchin g in the doghouse and th en we heard these steps in the silence, this absolute silence and snow. It was the oberschutzfuhrer, the Nazi with his dog. He was walking on the road cursing the Jews mu mbling things at who escaped behind holding him back from marching ahead away from the liberat ors and taking his precious cargo along. Whether the wind blew our scent away, I d on't know, but the dog ev idently did not smell us and he passed us by. Evidently Chicha was watching this from the window in the attic and she yelled out all our names and said Cipi, Rachel, Isabel la ar e you all here. And we said yes, well we're here, Rachel and Isabella but Cipi is probably in the next house because she had to do exactly what we did. Once the obershutzfuhrer was gone my sister yelled down, "Come on up here to the attic. Here I am and I found a frozen cabbage and it's delicious. We ran up and a few minu tes later the door was slightly opened and there were three other wretched creature s who escaped and they ma de their way into the same house. But it wasn't Cipi. This was the 23rd of January. We stayed in this house and had another anti-semitic experience when a forced labor worker from Poland, th ey were working around in Germany, they were forced laborers. He came and he wanted to chase us out because he wanted to take the contents of the house. He threatened us that the Germans are a ll around and they are going to kill us and we'd better leave. I think Chicha told him if this is what you want in the house you can take everything but let us stay here and eat some before we die. Leave us alone. He finally left. We stayed there Tuesday a nd Wednesday. Wednesday night the lights were cut. Chicha was smart enough to say the Germans must have left. They cut th e electricity. Sure enough it was true. It was Thursday morning. We were in our warm bedding, bare footed and sudd enly we saw a tremendous army entering the village, blood splattered soldiers, fighting soldiers, spent completely, and all kinds of war machinery, a nd we didn't know who they were . They didn't look like the Hungarian soldiers we knew and they didn't look like the German soldiers. Who were they? Suddenly we saw the sickle and the hammer and the red flag. We kn ew that was Russian. We ran out barefooted in the snow and we started to scream. We are liberated , liberated. It was an insane sound. You probably heard it on 42 nd street. Then we started to cry like nobody ever cried. We are liberated, we are liberated. But wh ere are they all? They are all dead. And Cipi? And there was no Cipi. Now that we were liberate d we went looking for Cipi. We spent six weeks there on the road waiting for all the survivors wh o survived pass through our town going towards the train and all we looked for was finding Cipi. We never found her. All those bastards who say today forget it, it happened long ag o, I have only this to tell them. To me it happened yesterday because it took me thirty some y ears before somebody related the stor y to me of what happened to Cipi. I looked for her for all those years. If I saw a familiar walk I followed that for blocks. I went to buy some bread in a bakery and I thought maybe this old lady is my sister who disappeared thirty some years ago. And even today when I know that absolutely certain that she's dead, if I see a head that looks familiar, I run. I never had any peace from that but I know from this eye-witness, one of the girls who was with us, her name was Eva [Phili p] [ph][385] who told me that 30 some years later when I told her now you can tell me. I met her a couple of years be fore and she started to tell me what happened and I br oke down crying so terrib ly that she stopped the story right there. But I told her now I am sitting in my kitchen and I'm very comfortable. You won't see me cry. You're talking on the telephone. Please tell me what happened. And then she told me that Cipi followed me some minutes later and they ca ught her and they beat her so br utally that she thinks she went crazy. She wanted to die. Three more weeks they marched in the most wretch ed conditions and they refused to kill her. She begged them kill me, kill me. They knew that her sisters were gone. She said she doesn't want to live, please kill me. They refused to kill her because they knew that she suffers more alive because her si sters are gone. She lo st them to freedom. Over and over she begged them to kill her and they refused to kill her. There were no more barbed wires so she had no way to kill herself. Another indication that you could not die when you wanted to. You could only die when they wanted you to die and only die th eir way, not your way. They dragged her to Bergen-Belsen for three weeks in that condition. Somebody saw her there. All she could say was my sisters, thank G-d they're in Am erica probably. They're free. At least they live, at least they're free. She was lovingly ta lking about us to this person who later on was liberated, came to America, and she couldn't cope with memories of Auschwitz and hanged hers elf. But she left us with Cipi's words. Then she was liberated. My sister Cipi was liberated. And then she died. And in those heaps of Bergen-Belsen, those m ounds, those miles of bodies that they were churning up with machinery, one of them wa s my sister. And it was that same Bergen-Belsen that that damn Reagan went to Bitburg and I don't wish him a good day because he did that . He went to Bitburg to honor the SS forty-some graves and it was my sister Ch icha who went, not along with him, to BergenBelsen on the same trip to protest him because it was that Bergen-Belsen that he was at that they wouldn't let my sister in, I think. He went to Bergen-Bel sen also. He went to Bitburg and edBelsen. My poor sister went to protest Reagan's atte ntion to Bitburg. Coming to the same edBelsen where my sister perished and I will always be angry about it, always, always hate him for doing that, for going to Bitburg. You wrote a poem about your yo ungest sister, did you not? Yes I did. Would you please read it for us? By the way I want you to know that we were the very first survi vors of Auschwitz to reach this land. We were put aboard a me rchant marine ship called the Brand Whitlock in Odessa. Finally we made our way to Odessa by Apr il, from January to April. We were put aboard this ship and we were through half the world for nearly five weeks and arrived by some mysterious coincidence on the very day the war ended. We arrived on May 8, 1945. That made us the first survivors of Auschwitz. You want to hear the poem that I wr ote about my sister: Ri ng around a rosy, six million is only a number, but each somebody's mother, somebody's child, somebody's lover, somebody's bride. Potyo was just thirteen; she was my sister. She had the wisdom of a child of war. She was full of fear yet ti ptoed with tenderness, laughter and love in a world of madmen. She was a weeping willow, a song of so rrow, a poem of infinite beauty . Why does Hitler hate me? Why does he love hate? Mama, I am only thirteen. I have songs yet to learn, games yet to play. Give me time to live. Give me time to die. Mama, how can I do all the living in just an inch of time? On a wretched piece of earth, alien land of terror and chaos, on another planet called Auschwitz, Mengele points at Potyo - Ring around a rosies, pocket full of posies, ashes, ashes. -- That it was. Thank you, Isab ella Leitner.
