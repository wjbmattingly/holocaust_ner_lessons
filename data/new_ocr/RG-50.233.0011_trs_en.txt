Q: And what had happened to your mother? A: In the meantime she gets a job. She was sitting on the steps on the Swiss Consulate because this was a little safe place.

And then she came home having lunch and she asked the superintendent to take off her name from the list, what was on the door when we come into the house. And she said, until you are in this house, your name has to be on the list. Later the Germans came and they took her, my mother. Not just my mother but many people until forty years of age.

Who could help, they helped. Q: Now you said this was a Red Cross house. Which Red Cross? A: This was not an official Red Cross.

Q: Did anyone come to visit your Red Cross house? A: My grandmother came and she brought a few matches and two soaps and she gave it to the lady leader and she kneeled and she asked to take care of us. Q: Where was the real Red Cross at this time? A: The real Red Cross, later on they told to the Red Cross that we are there and they came to visit us before Christmas, the real Red Cross, the International Red Cross. Q: The International Red Cross, not the Swedish? A: This I don™t know and then we were studyi ng all the chorales and all the songs for Christmas. And we had a nice Christmas tree and we celebrated it when they came showing that we are not Jewish people because they did not know that we are Jewish children. 21 Q: So you were masquerading as Christians and you had to pretend to be Christian even with the Red Cross? A: Yes. Q: These people, which country did they come from? A: I think they were Hungarians. Q: So you couldn™t trust them. A: No, in this time you cannot trust anybody. Q: What was it like living in he re? You were all children? A: Yes. Q: People that you knew? A: Where, in the orphanage, no. Q: You didn™t know any of the children? A: I had to take care for two children plus the kitchen because I was older. I was thirteen almost. I took care of a sick girl. her name was Regina; she had no shoes. I took care of my two brothers and we get better. It is a sickness what you get from dirt. We had three kinds of lice because there was no hot water, we cannot take a bath. It was always the air raid because or the Americans came or the Russians came or the English people came and it was a rebuttal, it was a fight and unfortunately a German tank was sta nding in front of the house with German soldiers and they were firing like crazy for the airplanes. It was impossible to go out on the street, mainly for a Jewish. Bu t the water was on the other side of the street. There was water. And then my brother dressed in my coat and in my hat because he said if somebody has to be aliv e then I am the one that has to be alive because I have to take care of my younger brother. And he went to the other side and he brought the water in a big pail. Q: So you were in this Red Cross home when the battle for Budapest was–? A: Budapest and the battle was on. Q: And was there fighti ng right near the house? A: Yes, near the house. And then one German, a young German died and we brought his body in and the other German asked us he want to escape in our 22building. But we were very afraid of hi m because the leader said that so many guns he had that he can kill all of us becau se we was hiding then in the coal, in the cellar. And then we did not let him in. Q: Did you see Russian troops? A: Many, many, many, they came in. Q: When did they come in? A: We was liberated January the 18 th in ™45. Q: You remember the day well. A: Yeah, we were very happy when they came in. Q: Did you leave the building? A: We did not leave the building because we did not know where to go. But my brother dressed again in my clothing b ecause for a boy it was not so good to go. He dressed like a girl and he stumbled on dead bodies and stones. There were many dead horses on the street and pe ople were eating the horse meat on the street. And my brother went to the ghetto to visit my grandmother and my aunt and they were alive. They were very thin, they looked like two girls, they were so thin. But they were alive. But they couldn™t take us home because the house was bombardiered, the part of it of the apartmen t, and it was winter. It was very cold, so we had to stay in the orphanage longer time for a few other months. Then my two brothers went to the orphanage home and just me , I went home with my grandmother. But for a while I went also to the home. Q; Were you near the Danube? A: Yes. Q: Did you see any of the mass acres along the river front? A: Really the massacres I did not see. I s ee the blood in Danube. I saw the shoes. I saw the dresses floating in the river, that I saw. Long time after the war till it was red. Q: Did they kill people along the river? A: Yes, to the shore because they was very angry. They was wild in the last part. Q: These were the Arrow Cross? 23A: Yes, yes, they was wild. Q: And then it™s only at the end of the war that you find out what had happened to your parents? A: We was waiting there years and years a nd we went to all the organizations; we did not know what happened with them for many years and we were always waiting. When I saw a lady sitting on the bench then I -- maybe this is my mother, maybe she forgets where she lives or something. But then I get a letter -- my mother gets a postcard from a hospita l in Budapest and the lady was together with my mother. She saw her. And then a neighbor in my grandmother™s house, she saw her dying. Q: And your grandmother, this is–? A: Vilma Mahrer, and this lady, Mrs. Pollack, she was dying and when she was dying she said she was together -- she did not want to tell us. But then when she was dying she told us what happened. Q: This is which..? A: My mother, Q: Your mother, this woman told you what happened? A: Yes, my grandmother™s neighbor was with her. Q: In Ravensbruck? A; Yeah, Ravensbruck. Q: What about your family of your futu re husband? Do you remember anything about what your husband™s experience was like at the end of the war? You mentioned that he was sent to different camps. A: Yeah, different camps, yes. He was 28 kilo and was very sick, tuberculosis, diarrhea, etc. etc. They put him in the hospital. Q: And then he was sent to Sweden. Was he sent to Sweden from Hungary or from Germany? A: No, the English army liberated him in Bergen-Belsen. Their job was to carry the dead bodies to a big, big grave. That™s what they were supposed to do, by the wrist, you know. And then he was so weak he couldn™t do it anymore and he lay down among the dead bodies. Then when the English army came in, the soldiers take his pulse and he said in English because he knew a few words in English, 24don™t leave me here I am alive, he says in English for the soldier, don™t leave me here, take me in the barracks because I am alive, 6631 is my number and my brother™s number is 6630. Take a look where he is, find my brother and bring him to me. And accidentally my son was bor n in 1966 April the thirtieth, the same number what this Gyussi had a nd therefore he is named Gyussi. Q: Now your husband, he went to Sweden, wa s he sent to Sweden by the British or was it the Swedish Red Cross? A: The king himself was very much moved wh en they saw the pictures. They gave a ship and I think the Red Cross, I don™t know, they took them to Sweden. Q: So your future husband went from Bergen-Belsen to Sweden? A: Maybe first he was in the hospi tal but yes, he was very sick. Q: So he went to Sweden and then he came back to Hungary after–? A: He was there two years. Q: And then they reopened their store a nd then sometime later you met him there. A: Yes, I was vacationing over there. I met him. He had nobody and I had nobody and we got married. Q: And then the family grew. A: Yes. Q: When you think about all of these even ts in the Holocaust, what comes to mind above all else? A: I think it was a big injustice what happ ened because we were really ordinary innocent people who did not hurt anybody. We did not ta ke nothing from anybody and we did not hurt anybody and really it was a big injustice. Q: What do you say to those who claim that it never happened? A: We have to read them all the stories wh at people are telling them and if they listen to the stories they will believe it. One person can lie, two persons can lie, but so many people cannot lie. Q: Do you have any other reflections? A: Yes, I say that not everybody is a bad person and you have to look in everybody, the nice and the good, and in myself , in my person, I don™t hate anybody. 25 Q: How did people survive? What was the difference between surviving and not surviving? A: In my case, in Budapest, the only thin g that I was lucky because I could die or from the bombardiering or from the hidi ng, every day I was in danger, and I get sick of it. I get thyroid problem and I™m on psychiatric care. Q: Your sense of this time, did you and fa mily members, was there a determination to survive? A; Everybody wanted to survive, yes. That™s what it is -- determination. It doesn™t matter how and why and where but we have to survive. Q: And what were you thinking of the futu re? Was there any discussion about the future whether this would come to an end? Was there any feeling that perhaps the Nazis would lose? A: There was a feeling that they would lose, yes.. Q: From the beginning? A: From the beginning, yes. We ha d a feeling that they would lose. Q: Did your parents, for example, did they think that this was a temporary disaster? A: Yes, that what they were thinking. Maybe they were wrong but they were thinking that we just– Q: A storm, a passing storm? A: Yes, and it will pass. Q; When did you realize, again you were a young girl, that the war was almost over and that the suffering might soon come to an end? A: I™ll tell you something, when my mother was still at home in November, we put our ears on the pillow, and we heard the guns and the fighting. It was not too far from Budapest, already, the Russians were very close. They were really close, we could hear them. Unfortunately they we re not close enough and it took time then to come. Q: The irony is that your parents who di d survive so long were taken away just before the final liberation. A: Yes, almost to the end. 26 Q: Well, on behalf of the Holocaust Muse um I would like to thank you for your time and your help. A: Okay, anytime.
