The second day of Rosh Hashonah we wanted to leave so the Rabbi sa id you are already on the run, never mind you can go. We will stay here and see what's going to happen. So we went another maybe 20, 30 miles and we got to the Russian border. It was a sma ll town, *Lanoftsa[ph122]. This little town was maybe 100% Jewish. Also the population took care of us...in line for fruit or bread. And they said not to worry, the Russians would co me over here. We didn' t believe it. Nobody believed that the Russians and the German s made a pact to divide Pola nd. It happened so that the Russian army came to Poland. No Russian soldier came to this little town there. They went and circled it and went they further and we stayed there and again the *Byezh enski[ph134] they called us. It came Yom Kippur and we went to the shool. The whole town was there. I come there in the shool, and in the hall out side I see there a man sit ting there with a gun so I asked what is this. He says this is the only militia man we have. He is Jewish. He wanted to go to Kol Nidre and the other one is a great land owner here in this section and he had to watch him and not to lose him he took him in the shool also. Then the Russians came and we went to the bigger city there in eastern Poland, Lvov or Lemberg. The city was so filled up with popu lation. It had before the war some 300,000 population and now with the refugees the town had over a million population. ..had to go back to bring some clothing and maybe some valuables a nd I went back to Ge rmany, to the German part of Poland. I went there wi th a Ukrainian shiksa who was in love with me and another Jewish girl and we went back to Poland . But this is all complicated. Are there any major things that ha ppened at this time, episodes or incidents that you remember? The Russian soldiers, wherever they were, when somebody wanted to come this way, the Russians said go back. So we were by the border and the Ru ssians stopped us. This was already on the way back. So we told him we want to go to the Germ an side but we changed our minds, we want to go back. He said so go back. So we crossed the border without being bothered by the Russians. This is luck. And then people didn't know what chances to take. It was only to take a chance. I survived because I didn't have any illusions. As soon as we were in the wagon I pr epared for myself. I took a carton of cigarettes, a loaf of bread and a blade, a sawing blad e I put in my shoes between the soles. We knew what's going on but the people didn't want to know it. You knew about the camps? We knew about the camps maybe no t so close about it but we knew . When I jumped the train I knew that I was taking a chance with maybe two or three weeks of life. Do you want to tell us about the time when you jumped the train or wa s that much later? No this is later. I can tell you maybe skip the ghetto, how th e ghetto worked and how it was arranged. That would be interesting. What did you do there? When they started with the ghetto and they needed people to work for them. But nobody wanted to go to work. So they went out, the Germans, and they caught people on th e street, wherever they found them and they sent them to the railroad stati on. There the job was to widen the railroad tracks because the Russians have a different width of the railroad tracks. It was very hard work. There was a man, his name was Horowitz, and he was the head of the congr egation. That was a famous family. They had a tallis factory in Kolomjya. He came out and he had a big speech for volunteers to go to the railroad station so the Germans promised him they woul dn't catch nobody on the street. So I volunteered. I was a strong y oung man. I spoke fluent German. Where were you when you volunteered for this? In the ghetto. We went only to German schools. So at home we spoke German and this helped a lot maybe too. Anyhow we were ther e and everybody looked to have a bunker in the house where they lived. So we had the attic, like th is was the wall from th e attic, so we built up a second wall. We had a foot, maybe two feet space between the two walls and if somebody came up the stairs and looked left and right and he saw ju st the wall so he didn' t expect that there are double walls. So the next day I volunteered and the son of a bitche s they hit us the same as before. Also I was a little experienced with it. But anyhow I went home and I said no more volunteering. La ter on it was the ghetto a little organized and there came a lot of Hungarian Jews, among th em my wife and parents too and they had there a soup kitchen and they made me in charge of order in the soup kitchen. It was not an easy charge. They ga ve out maybe some five or six th ousand portions and to keep order among a few thousand hungry people is not an easy job. But anyhow they had nobody else and they made me the head of the kitchen. There among others my wife came there for soup, too. I always treated her good. It was so there were these Hungarian Jews and I didn't come in one day to work and everybody was asking fo r me because they kne w when I was there everybody had to be disciplined and that's all we n eeded because the soup they got fi ve minutes earlier or later but everybody was hungry. And it happened so later on when I escaped from this ghetto I was in Hungary and there some Jews were escaping from Kolomjya too and they heard about my name and they asked me if I was there in the soup kitchen. Do you want to tell us about y our escape? How did you escape? In this ghetto there came every fe w weeks, there came an action they called it. They took thousands and thousands of people. First they segregated. I was there on the plaza a nd I was the head of the kitchen there with my personnel an d I talked to this German and he gave me half the employees and me. After this went by, they to ok away this one day quite a few thousand people . But they always did the same thing. When the day went by, whoever survived they made believe that this would be already the end of it, that they w ouldn't take any more people. But I didn't trust them. I forgot to tell you something else, let's skip it. Do you want to go back and tell me, it's okay. The first action what there was, th ere were German and Hungarian soldiers. I had a little store there in the ghetto with sweets, bakery and so on. I we nt to work on a Sunday mo rning. I go out and I see the street is empty. I kept going and I see there's a German SS standing and he stopped me and asked me where I'm go ing so I told him I am going to open up the store. So he looks at me and he says you see over there on the ro ad there is standing maybe some two three hundred people, Jews and they were surrounded by SS men and German shepherds and he says go there and join these people. I was wearing a tr ench coat and here on the left arm I had the Jewish star and I was walking here. I didn't go on the road, I st ayed on the sidewalk. My coat opened up and covered here the star and as I approached this group they started walking towards me. I stayed on the sidewalk and I walked by. There was a gr oup of Polacks standing there and they said in Po lish, for heaven's sake you'd better go home because they will grab you too and yo u will never come ba ck. I went around there a few blocks and I went back home and this wa s the first action they took. I come home and I told it to my father so he says in honor of your grandfather they didn't take you. Out of this group none came back. Among others there was the sister or the wife of the *Judenratt[ph 303] this Mrs. Horowitz and everybody was asking go and try to get the people out. He was collaborating as good as he could and he didn't interven e for his wife. He as ked to intervene for th e whole group and they didn't want to give it to him. So this Mr. Horowitz later on when he realized that this was a lost case committed suicide. This wa s the Mr. Horowitz in Kolomjya. Do you know what year this is? This was in 1940, 41. Th is was the fall of 1941. Do you want to move on to your escape from this ghetto. You did go to other places. Is that right? I stayed in this ghetto till th e last action was there and the Ge rmans surrounded the whole ghetto. They came at night between three and four o'clock and they took everybody out of the beds and put them all on this plaza. My father wasn't there anymore. He was taken away the action previous. They kept us there on this plaza th e whole day. Only in the afternoo n we went out. I was there with four other friends and everybody had some kind of instrument hidden on him. We didn't know where they will take us because they took people sometimes in the village behind this town and they prepared ditches and they took the people there and shot them there in the ditches or they could take us to the railroad station. So we made up, everybody was voting for me, I was always the guy who got the votes, so I told the group - I said we go to the railroad station, then we have a better chance to jump out of the window or something. If they take us there to this little village then we will know that we don't have much of a chance. So we went to the railroad station, eight abreast, and we go on the road, so we knew that we're go ing to the railroad station. Here next to me was a woman with a little baby in the arm and as we walk along she takes the baby and pushes it on the Polish woman's arm. She didn't know the woman, she didn't know her name. She just took a chance. She knew that this child has more of a chance maybe to su rvive. This is what I say when it comes to discussions about the holocaust an d so on about the books that came out in the tens and the hundreds, who can describe the f eeling of this woman who gave aw ay her baby. Who can describe this? So anyhow we went to the railroad station and we were maybe in th e middle of this whole march. I see that they're starting by the end of the train and they're chasing in there some seventy or a hundred people. Then they go to the second train and they're hocking and beating everybody and then I saw one of these cattle wagons had their window taken out and repaired. So I said to my group we stopped and we let the fr ont go further and we went here and went to this wagon here, to this wagon I picked out. We went in there. Nobo dy was hitting us and we were safe in this wagon. It happened so that I was standing there and I had the feeling that I' m just a neutral observer. When I heard the people talking I had the feeling that it doesn't concern me and th e episode with the water did you put it in here before? No. There was in this wagon some seventy or a hund red people and there was no place to sit down. Only part of the people could s it down. Then somebody looks out the window and it was very hot. The sun was shining on the roof. It was only October. Then somebody hollers they're putting in bread and water in the wagons. So I said to my fr iends. You will see nobody will drink the water. They said what are you crazy. An d I said no, I,m not cr azy but I know what's going to happen. And sure enough after a few minutes they're pushing in tw o loaves of bread an d a pail of water and everybody goes and tries to grab a piece of bread or a sip of water and they turned over the pail. So I told my friends, you se e, this is what I know will happen. And we were st anding so in the corner the whole day and it got dark the train started moving. I talked to my wife's parents before we before we went into the wa gon. Then I said we have a chance to get out when we will take out the piece of wood there on this window . This was easy to take out. Ev erybody had a screw driver or a hammer or something. And I said we will jump ou t. There I saw a lot of people who jumped. Everybody who jumped from the train had here a scrape of the face like this because this movement of the train it went forwards and you had to jump backwards because you get the push from the movement. I was jumping the third. The firs t one I said you will be the first one jumping out you'll go in the direction of th e train and the second also and the thir d stays on the plac e and the rest of them goes back and we will meet here. But it happened so that I met only one of my friends. This was a young man by the name of Hammer. His parents had a paper factory in the village next to this Kolomjya. This Hammer the Germans made him the manage r of this paper factory and every day in the morning he went out w ith a group of workers from the gh etto. He went to work and at night he came back. So he says we will go there to this village and we'll make believe that we came out of the ghetto to work. We had to stay there the whole day and wait till they went back to the ghetto. He went to work and he put me there in a shack and he says I will bring you something to eat. Just stay there. Sure enough he brought me to eat and at night we went back to the ghetto like from work. And the other group came back. And we went to the ghetto. And here comes a Mr. Haas, he was the h ead of the ghetto. A Jewish head? Yeah, yeah. He says to me , Henry I want you to be the distributor of the brea d. After each action or whatever it was the Germans wanted to know how many were left an d they sent so many portions of bread in. So I said no I'm not interested anymore in nothing, only one thing I want to get out of here. This time there was maybe a few hundred ma ybe less than a thousand people there in the ghetto out of 25,000 or mo re. So he says you can make a fort une. I say I know how to make a fortune by this bread distribution but I'm not interest ed anymore. So how is the gold mine there? You got so and so many pounds of bread. I don't know, everybody got a pound or so, something like this. The one who sold the br ead had a scale - two pots, on each side a pot and one side were the weights, on the other si de the bread. It took a day to distribute a whole br ead. So here where the bread was were crumbs. I never cleaned out the crumbs. The crumbs were staying there the whole day and from every portion of brea d the crumbs may be a quarter of an ounce or something and by the end of the day everything wa s distributed and you had one brea d, maybe two breads left over. But I said not interested anymore. And there was a Po lish, a Ukrainian peasant maybe who delivered to the Germans, they ha d a place where they collected meta l, rags, and so on where they could recycle. This peasant came one day and says next week We dnesday there came the smuggler to me and he has to have ten people and he will take you over the border. This smuggler was the same that Elizabeth went with. I didn't know about it. Was he a Hungarian? No,, no, this was Poland, Ukrainian. He comes. There was a gi rl living with me in the ghetto, a Hungarian girl, not this one. They send the smuggler for her, to bring her back to Hungary. But the smuggler wanted to go on ly with ten people because otherwise it doesn't pay so I told the guys and they said they won't go, they will hire and go with the truck not with the peasant there. So I said okay you can do what you want. Wh at do you think you have such a good credit rating? The Polak will take you when he gets his money in advance. This pe asant came and I spoke to him and I told him that I will go only with this one girl and for this one girl they had the money in Hungary. The next day we made arrangem ents and this peasant ca me there to this lot where they had these rags and he said he will go through town and by the end of the town there's a river and a bridge and when they cross the bridge he will stop and take us on this buggy. So we went thro ugh town and this girl was very semitic Jewish looking a nd whenever we went by a store an d it was dark and the store was light I told her to wear a hat an d I took off my band and somehow I felt like I'm a free bird. Why should I wear this? So I took it off and the girl took it off and we went through the whole town till we caught up with this peasant and he stopped and said, get up. So we went on this buggy and we laid flat on the floor and covere d ourselves and he drove off. It took quite a few hours till we got where the peasant lived a nd we arrived on his farm and there wa s a big mountain of dried leaves. He buried us in these leaves and he said to stay here an d he will come back late r. Maybe after a half an hour, an hour, the peas ant comes and says let's go. He took us in the stable. In the stable was hay upstairs and he says go up there and stay there in the attic. Af ter a long while he comes with a loaf of bread and a can of milk and we were eating supper, so called. An d the peasant says tomorrow morning he goes back ther e and what shall he tell the peop le? So I told him you want to do me a favor I wrote him down on a piece of paper in German to trus t this man, that he is a very decent guy and not to take chances with some truc ks or something. I told the peasant to tell the smuggler that we will ha ve to go by ourselves because they don't know him and they don't trust him to go. The next day the peasant go es into town and at night he co mes back and he opens up the trap door and sticks his head in and says in Hungaria n[690], in English - in Kolomjya there's nothing left. And it happened so that I had such a feeling that pulled me out of this ghetto, out of this town. The Germans surrounded the whole rest of the ghetto what was there and they lit it up from all sides and hardly some body could escape from it. What year was this? This was 1943. Where did you go after that? After that this peasant went with us. We went to the smuggler and I told him to tell the smuggler that when we will be on the other side, on the Hungarian side, he will have to bring a piece of paper, a letter that I gave him and other people will come the next time. They want to have proof that we are safe in Hungary. Besides me and this girl was anothe r Jewish woman. She was hiding somewhere in the woods and the pe asants were feeding her and then there come another young boy and he says the next night we will go. And the smuggler says don't worry. If there is any danger don't panic I will use the gun. So we went with the same smuggler and after a few days we're on the Hungarian side. The smuggler take s the letter there from this girl to her relatives. The smuggler goes away and that night he comes back and says nobody is there at this addr ess. The people ran away and he doesn't have nowhere to leave us. So I said what does this mean? He says we have to try whatever you can but I would ad vise you to go to some gendarmes and give yourself up. This was a sure death because the Hungarians when they caught so mebody gave over to the German gestapo. They were right by the border. I had some Polish money so th e smuggler exchanged some Polish money for Hungarian. This young boy who was with us said that he's going back with the smuggler. This boy was living in the village where he lived before the war and he stayed overnight every night somewhere else. He didn't even tell the peasants that he's there. Nobody knew, but he slept every night somewhere else. He went back. So I was left wi th these two women. The peasant came. He gave me some other few pennies[*Hunga rian731] he had, this Hungarian money and he left us there. This was on a Friday night also. The pe asant went away. When it got dark, I go out from this bunker. This was built up from pressed hay for the winter for the cows, and inside was hiding us. It was hollow. He goes away and that's all and he says lots of luck. We started walking towards the village. It's light in the house and I hear singing Zemiros and I thou ght now we are safe. I go to the door and knock on th e door and the woman as ks in Hungarian who is it. I answered in Yiddish to open up the door we need help. So this woman didn' t open the door. But she was hollering so loud [* in Yiddish749]. She didn't open the door. Could you translate for the tape? Yes, go away from my door. You're killing me. So we left her and we're walking and we come to another house. There was a light in it but it was not Jewish. And I said to the woman who was with us, she was a typical aryan face you go there (and she spoke very go od the language also) and ask about directions, where the railroad station is and so on. So the woman goes in. She knocks on the door. Somebody opened th e door and she walks in and I neve r saw this woman again. We were sitting there maybe at least an hour and nobody came out. I didn't want to take any chances. We go there to this village and all of a sudden a horse and buggy guy comes by and he stops and says where do you want to go ? So I told him I want to go to the railro ad station. So he says go sit down. So we went there in this buggy and we went to this village. All of a sudden ther e's a little bar there and this guy stops and walks inside the bar and says wait here I'll be right back. We're waiting and he didn't come out either. Anot her guy comes out and he's followi ng us. We started walking and he's following us. I said let's go in here. There's a dark yard there. We wa lk in there and he follows us too in there. I stopped and I said to this gi rl, talk to him in Hungari an. I didn't speak the language. I said do some thing, try, do something. I started talking to the guy Polish, whatever I could, Hungarian I didn't know much. I took off my watch and I had a lighte r and I said here take the watch and the lighter, what else can I give y ou and let us go. So he took the watch and the lighter and he says okay over there is the railro ad station but watch out don't get caught because when you get caught here you are lost. This was right by the borde r. So we go to the railroad station and outside it was dark and inside was only a pale light. I go inside and I tell the girl not to stand in the light. There is a line there and people are standing in line for thes e tickets. There come two policemen, two gendarmes, tall guys, and they started talking to me and I didn't want to answer, just moved my hand like this, but I understand, he wants to go ahead of me in the line. So he was ahead of me and I came to this window in plain Poli sh but in Ukrainian it's the same thing. I said Two to *Rachov[ph792]. This was the next town. In *Rachov this girl had a mach tainiste[*ph799]. "In-law" Yeah, in *Rachov. So she says we 'll go to *Rachov and then we'll see what's going to happen. So we go into this train and I asked this girl how do you say in H ungarian good-night or good evening? I learned this and I said you take the tickets and I will sit here and sleep and when the conductor comes to check the tickets you handle it. Sure enough he co mes to take the tickets and *Rachov was the next station. When we arrive in *Rachov I see a tumult, a lot of soldiers arou nd. I said this is just perfect. In Europe when you go out from the railroad statio n they take your ticket when you walk out and they look at everybody in the face . In this little town everybody knows each other. When we got to the gate I said in Hungarian[* 815]. This means good evening. So the guy answers[*816] and salutes. We went out and we went to this *mach tainiste. This was again a Friday night. We get there and the girl knocks on the door and the *mach tainiste comes out and opens the door and she didn't recognize the girl. Fi rst of all she was maybe ten days in the woods and she didn't eat and so on. So she told her who she is. She started lamenting you can't stay here, it is dangerous and all kinds of stories. So I said to the woman, look you do n't have to give nothing to me. I don't need nothing, but this is your relati ve. So she says okay. Th is was after Succos. She said my neighbor next door has there a succa. Go in there and you will stay there overnight. So I said look I will stay there only if your neighbor knows about it because I don't want him to come out and catch a thief. So the woman gave us a glass of milk, bu t cold because it's Shabbos and wouldn't be heated and we st ayed overnight. I said we won't go in the succa, we'll go in your outhouse, not the neighbor's. We went in this outhouse and the wind blows and the door goes open and closed. So I took out from my shoe the shoelace and I tied up the door. In the morn ing the woman comes out and she gave the girl some money and says go over there. There's a synagogue and they will help you. She didn't help anymor e. She spoke Hungarian so I was not go od for her. She goes away and I go in the street and I go to this big building where she shows me the synagogue and I see it's full of soldiers there. It was taken over by the army and they made their barracks there in the synagogue. Further down the block I see a Jew coming there w ith a tallis so I stopped him and asked him where's the shool and he says don't go in here. There's a barracks here. And he showed me there is another synagogue. He went there. He opened up, there was a padlock on the door. He says, go inside. I will put up th e padlock from the outs ide so that nobody will know somebody went in here. Sure enough he we nt away. I sit dow n and there was a big iron stov e there, heated up. I sat down and fell asleep. All of a sudden I wake up and I didn't know where I am . I think I'm dreaming. I see all the Jews ther e with the Streimel, fur hats and so on and everybody is singing and dancing and I was sleeping throug h the whole ceremony. One of the Jews co mes over to me and asks me where are you from . I told him. He says you know what, do you see this gentleman there, this Jew, when we are going hom e, you follow him. He knows about it, you follow him. So I follow this Jew to the house and we're coming in. There are his wi fe and three daughters but he told me, don't talk to my wife , don't tell her nothing b ecause she will be afraid. I ate there and then he says to go back to the synagogue. I went back to the s ynagogue. He told me that the padlock would be open like it was in the morning. I sat down and there came in a congregation, they call it *shalisheedos[ph880] The third meal of the sabbath. That's right. They came there. They were singing an d eating and drinking and they say the next day I will go to Marmarosz-sighet. Romania. Yes but this was Hungary. So he says this young man goes to *Mar malo Sigurt. You just follow him when you go off the trai n, don't talk to him nothing. Here is your ticket. We're going to jump ahead a little bit if you don' t mind. I'm interested in knowing about your time with the partisans. Could you tell me a little bit about how you got involved with it, what you did there? Yeah, but again it's the same. It's too long. Tell me about the major parts. The major parts. In 194 4, August the 28th erupted an uprising in Slovakia. It was organized by Russian paratroopers and the barra cks of the Slovakian army. Th ere's a difference between the Czechoslovakian army and the Slovakian army. They were in th e barracks and the Russians drove in with a truck to the barracks and he said here we give you a choice, do you want to be with us or against us? So they join ed this uprising and we we re a group of 20 people. I said don't rush into something because we didn 't know who was the leader. The communist party to ok over the Russian partisan movement and the democratic government had a branch in London. We had there a Polish lieutenant, he was Jew, and he got in touch through the Slovakian army with London and the army wanted us to join the army, and the Russians wanted us to join the part isans. This whole movement lasted two months. Then the Germ ans encircled it and we went in the woods. I forgot to mention when we were taken from the ghe tto to the railroad station I learned something from the Germans right there. There came a truc k of German soldiers to the town where we were and partisans encircled and took them off the truc k. They were standing on the side of the road, about 40 German soldiers. All of a sudden they dispersed the Germans. Everybody went in a different direction and you couldn't shoot because you would shoot civilians. All thes e Germans escaped. So I took an example from this an d I told them if we go to this village if we run away, everybody has to run away in a different direct ion. But it didn't come to it. So the Germans came in and encircled this whole piece of land. It went from *Bratislava [ph955] to *Korshitza [ph955]. When the Germans came closer we decided we had to go in the woods. There was a whole groups of soldiers,2 escapees from the POW camps and there was even an American B2 9 bomber landed there and he couldn't get out of it because the lawns were wet and he couldn't start. We went in the woods and all of a sudden (I was very good in orienting myse lf by the stars or by the trees and so on ) and we all thought that we're going eas t to meet a Russian ar my but I stopped and I said no we're not going east, we're going north and north are the Germans. There's the town of *Karzhmarop[ph973] and some other towns and I stopped there one of the Ru ssian officers and one of the Americans and they took out a map and they took a soldier on a horse and they sent him ahead on the first line and told him to come back. So they ca me back and they tu rned around and we we nt east. There the Russians were there pretty close so we came there it started snowing already and we came there on top of the mountain *Prashiva[[p h985] is the name of this mount ain and the Russians sent home the Slovakian soldiers, they didn't have confidence in them and only th ey kept the POWs or groups like we that we couldn't go hom e. We were there a coup le of days on this mount ain and then they said they will go east to try to join the Russian army. I didn't like the idea and I told my friends when everybody is going your wa y I would like to stay he re. Why? I said they had the headquarters of the partisans and they had there laying around bags of lentils and in the snow were frozen big beef liver and another piece of meat. So that's all stories. I'd like to know maybe about the story of how you met up with your wife. Could you tell us that? When I went with my wife..Anyhow after this whole episode we we nt through the fro nt and in the valley they were shooting and we were on to p of the mountain and went through the front and came out behind the front lines on the Russian side. The first soldiers we met there were Romanians and these Romanians were starving. They didn't have any food. We had food but we didn't have any cigarettes so we changed with the Romanian soldiers, bread for cigarettes. Af ter we passed the front line they took us to the barrack s and the officers were mostly Jews. In the Russian? No, in the Czechoslovakian army. There were Czechoslovaks were se nt by the Russians to Siberian and then they came back with the army they organized in Siberi a. They were mostly Jews because they were running away from the Germans, from Hitler. This is the army in exile. There were two Czech armies if I'm not mistaken. Yeah. There were two Polish armi es, too. One of my brothers wa s in the west in the Polish army and the other one was with the Russians in the east . Anyhow we went ther e and I had no idea if somebody lives or doesn't live and we went to Buch arest. I heard that in Bucharest the JOINT is active but the war was still on. We met the Russia ns and we had to give up our arms and I had left around some bullets and we were there with some Romanian soldiers that we re collaborating with the Russians. The Russians gave th em guns but they didn't give th em bullets. So they bought from us the bullets and we went to Bucharest. I thought I had a lot of money there. It was quite a few thousand lei. We came to Bucharest and we went to take baths in the public baths. The money was just enough for the bath and a gla ss of soda. I got in touch with the JOINT. I knew I have a cousin in Israel, in Tel Aviv. He went out of Poland before the war. His name was Saltzman. So I wrote the address Saltsman, Tel Aviv. The first name I knew, too, Binim. We were there in Bucharest two, three weeks. After three weeks I go and th ey said there's a note there for me. So what happened. They found this Saltz man and they gave him the note an d they found out the first time that I'm alive and my one brother was with my cousin th ere. My cousin had there a tannery during the war and did business wi th the English. Elizabeth had here before this piece of paper from the JOINT. They write that I'm here and my brothers are here and one brother is there and one brother is in the Polish army and one is in England. Can we jump a little and see how close to your ti me of liberation. Where were you and what was going on and how were you liberated? Liberated? I liberated myself. I crossed the border there. When I went to Bucharest I was already liberated. I wasn't clear if the JO INT was already operating. The JOINT operated there because Bucharest was liberated by the Ru ssians before. But Budapest was liberated only the middle of January 1945. You were in Hungary? I was in Bucharest and th en we went to Budapest and then I was looking for my wife. I had the address and I walk in. The building is standing bu t there was a big hole in the building from the top to the bottom. The bomb went in but didn't expl ode. I went into the stai rcase and I see somebody is coming down and there she wa s. She did not recognize me at first either an d then she said are you that Henry? And I said yes. It happened so that she had a guy waiting outsi de for her, a date. So she didn't even go back to him. We went upstairs in the apartment. I have other episodes with the partisans. Anything that stands out in yo ur mind, a particular adventure? We were a group of Jews there wi th the partisans and they sent us out on missions to put bombs under the tracks and so o n. Among other things there came a Je wish group of four or five men. They were with the English air for ce. They came from Israel but there was no Israel yet. They were with the Hagana. They came with the idea to bring out the few thousand Jews hiding in the woods in Slovakia and they came with the idea to make a bridge. They want ed to take out by plane the group of Jews that we re in the woods. They go t in touch or we got in touch with them and they wanted to take out our group, there were some 20 Polish boys and girl s and they wanted us to be the first ones coming out. But then the war started, the uprising collapsed. There was with us a young man by the name of Chaim *Hermish [ph1165] When we cr ossed the front the Russians took out us, the Polish group, they didn't know what to do with us so they gave us to the Czechoslovakian army. There was this Chaim Hermish and another Israeli sold ier. There wasn't an Is rael then. They went to Odessa and from Odessa they se nt them back to Palestine. This was the end of Chaim Hermish. After the war, in 1950, we went the first time to Israel from Europe. This Chaim Hermish, he went to Palestine and he went on the radio and he was r eading a list of names. Among others he had my name. Somebody heard it on the ra dio, a friend of my brother's an d he called him up and he says somebody heard your brother. So he says what are you craz y and this time he didn't have yet from the JOINT. And he called up th e radio station and asked who this was. So they gave him the address of this Chaim Hermish. My brother went and looked him up in a ki bbutz and he was sitting with him there the whole night and he was telling him stories about me. This was how he heard the first time. I wanted to get in touch with this Chaim Hermish. So my brother couldn't catch him. They said he is a *sheleach [ph1207] somewhere in South America and he is not there. It took years. My brother passed away in the meantime. In 1970 my brother was hardly alive. He says to me I heard Chaim Herm ish lives in the kibbutz *Glitzon [ph1217] this is in the north near Haifa. So I called him up and th ey told me yes he lives here but he isn't here now. In 1970 I finally met him and it was a reunion. I want to thank you very much. You have had many adventures. At some time maybe we can hear more of them. I really appreciate your time.
