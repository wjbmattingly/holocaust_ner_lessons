Question: If who swindled? A: There are photographs, you said, taken by the Air Force. Q: Well, yes. A: That doesn't look to me like a photograph taken by the Air Fo rce. That is a photo mounting of aerial, of aerial, aerial view of the region and a drawing which was added on top of the, of the map, just for educational purposes. Q: It looks... A: What?

A: I've been moving from ba rrack to barrack in the whole region, including later on, _______________ new zone that was established with the new camp and I had the permission to measure each barrack, each, to take all the measurements because I pretended that I don't, that I want to do that myself becaus e I don't want to use ________ _______ original architectural drawings. Because we were smuggling out plans an d if we would have ever caught, then they would have suspected that I have been involved, yeah? So I ca mouflaged my whole operation by, by, measuring the whole model which I made, meas uring barrack by barrack and distances from 2 each barrack and so on. So I had set camp in, still in my head, I can know the numbering system, good or bad, whatever __ ______________ _______________ afterwards, I couldn't care less, but I, I produced a camp model and a good one which were sent, taken away and _______________ _______________ sent first to the, to the headquarters of the SS and then they told me it was to Berlin. And so did all my other, other work of drafts and di agrams went to th e_______________ ofttimes. But we had no fifth row in the _______________ camp flag like produced in all of those drawings. As I have shown you, I have here some publications, with correct, with correct drawings, with correct numbers. Everything else were done and copied by, by a people who were more interested in, in, in, telling their stories than to make a correct, au thentic, they are people who could not read a map then and from young people like Kitty Hart(ph), I don't where she lear ned to read an architectural map or a land drawi ng or so. And she just copies it and if go further you will find dozens and dozens, many dozens of ______.

That's interesting. So ___ ____________, when I went with her [speaks foreign language here], she instructed me what to tell_______________ girls. So she said, write home, write to your people and write to them whatev er you want, that you are here and you are alive and you are well off. Each helped us, so what I did, I said to the Hungarian girls, 8 "Look, you are told to write to your people but please don't write to the correct addresses of your people because some of them are in hiding or so. Write to the center Jewish office and ask them to forward it to certain people." And the Hungarian gi rls were mad at me beca use I told them not to write to their people, but to write through a center office. So they're running to the SS woman and told SS woman that I told them not to write. Now, then what could I do, sh e nearly, she went mad. She said, "Are you out of your mind?" I said, "No, they did not understood Hungarian." So, but it, it was, it wasn't fun. Q: ___________________. I: [speaks foreign language here]. The Nazis not believe me, but th ey believed the SS woman. And [speaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here]. That was dangerous.

From Englis h into ______________? Q: It's, it's, it's, of course. 9 I: Because that's a biography, this is the biography of Gracie. Gracie ______________. A: Yeah. [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Now I'm telling her about one situation because she's _________ _______ arrived at the end of '42, but she's did not know prior to that what I have experien ced as being amongst the very first women in the camp. And she's interested becaus e the Auschwitz people at the museum, in their whole research and report have very little reports on the day by day happenings during. We have general, general idea, but we don't know individual cases and so my case is a unique one, because as I have been spared by a camp commander of Birkenau, was only for two months, who had a secretary who was [speaks foreign language here]. She had a Jewish boyfriend and for that she was arrested. Now, there is a special, an Eng lish expression for ______ __________, you probably know it, but it turns my tong ue around and I have to look that up. In any case, if a Jew and a nonJew live together, were married together, they were either forced to, to divorce, or if they were unmarried, the man were arrested if he was Jewish a nd usually killed and the German woman ended up in a concentration camp. The in signia of the badges turned into a combined yellow-purple star, yeah and so that commander of the camp, whose name was Mill er, he was there only for two months, had a secretary who was one of those Jew lovers and, and she begged for mercy. I, because I was sitting there just to be loaded onto the trucks and while walking she walked from her barrack during lunchtime or so, to her office, which was in front of the entrance of the temp women's camp and I called out to her, "Look, honey, I'm here." And she was running up to her office and all of a sudden, a notorious SS man arrived, his name was Sht eebitz(ph), "Where is that inmate so and so?" And then they guided him to me and then he asked me, "What are you doing here ?" I said, "I don't know. I want to go back to work ." So he said, "Come with me." Took me back to the barrack and asking me to go up and_________ ______ three tier of, three rows of bed which were built, one on top of the others, exactly the one you have at yo ur museum, asking, I had Typhus and I was very sick, asking me to go up and down and up and down and up and down several times. Little he knew 10 that I was trained to, to go up and down mountains and I'm______ _________ a girl, I could climb and I, I was very weak, but still I, I, I managed. I was used to go up the ladder, by doing murals during my professional ca reer and so on. He didn't know that and I managed nicely up and down as many times as he wanted me to do and then taking me out, asking me to jump over the, the, what was this thing, ____, it's a ditch, yeah. There were ditches alongs ide the center, the central camp road, not like, ________ _______ said, [speaks fo reign language here]. A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Ah. A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here] We are laughing because he, he translated this so funny. And he's a friend of her, so. Of, now what have I, yes, so he took me over to jump over the ditch and off to the... A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Ah, she said that was, that was ______________. [s peaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] I: It was quite, and I could jump , yeah, so I jumped. So I passe d my jump, I passed my up and down and then, into the camp infirmar y. [speaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here]. In that office, th ere was Orly(ph), a German... A: Yes. ______________, Orly(ph). I: Orly(ph) ___________ ___, who was a ____________ _, no _____________. A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here]. In any case, there were a lot of girls, ___ ____________ German women from the_______________ fi rst group that my friend Enna (ph) Weiss(ph) who was then already_______________ on the doct or, physician ____ ______________. A: [speaks foreign language here] 11 I: [speaks foreign language here]. Then there were so me employees, some nur ses, everybody, yeah and the men in charge, the SS men in charge, Hein ry(ph) Schwartz(ph), yeah ? And he, he was not happy that the camp leader, sending over ______ _________ who was ______________, to overrule his desire to kill everybody and to gas everybo dy who is, who was there already waiting to be loaded onto the trucks. And while he, he, and, so he made it hi s business, he didn't know exactly how, what to do. Hirst(ph) de scribed him as the most reliable SS man in the camp, yeah? So whenever he had an order, he wa s 100 percent. That's the fax. Q: Let's wait one second. [pause] I: ...idea. Q: What? I: We had met, anyway... Q: You have to speak so I, so I will understand. I: I tell you the story which I started at the other time. Q: Okay, then finish... I: No, it's another time, it had nothi ng to do with our meeting, yeah? A: Yes. I: I have been transferred to a camp office after bei ng released from the, from... [end of side one, tape 1] Q: This is side two of tape one. I: Is, is, is that item which I gave you okay? Q: Yes.

[s peaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] I: No. [speaks fo reign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] I: No, ______________ haven't learned a damn thing and I just , she just reminded me that I've been, during my___________ ____ because that is a real hole in my, I've remember ed fragments. I become a fragmental woman like what's her name? Eliz abeth, Elizabeth Lightner(ph) or Isabella Lightner(ph)? Yeah, no, the time from, of my _______ ________ ordeal, yeah, I have a lot to memorize. I've rememorized a lot, but I lost the time, the times, time, development, step by step. I don't know what happened before an d what happened afterwards, yeah? Q: When did you get Typhus? I: Still in Auschwitz. Q: Auschwitz I? 13 I: Auschwitz I and I have been relocating to Birk enau on, crowding on those necks and arms, it was a horrible thing, but I had to do it because they were , they were killing some people who were left behind and were reported sick. Q: So you got it before you moved to Birkenau? I: Yeah. Q: In July? I: Something, something... Q: You moved into, Au gust? July- August? I: Yeah. A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here]. Yeah, in, in English, why don't you use the German word? It's [speaks foreign language here]. What are you calling ____? Q: ________________ is Camp(ph) Street. I: Yeah, but what are you using in English? Q: Well lager(ph) is camp. I: Yeah. Q: And strasser(ph) is street. I: Yeah, but if you, if you, if you write, or publ ish, what are you using, what are the people using? Q: You could say lagerstrasser(ph). I: Road, the road, Camp Road? It was more road than a street, a street looks different. [speaks foreign language here] Q: Which one, which, where is the lagerstrasser(ph) I: Always in the center of th e road. In th e center of... A: Center of the... I: ...the camp A: camp, of the camp. 14 I: Yeah. Then center road of the camp, yeah. And a strasser(ph) and a road , is that was [speaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] I: It was not an avenue, it was not a street, but it was a road. Like what I said. Q: Okay. I: You see? Q: When did you, when did you arrive in Auschwitz, Birkenau? A: [speaks foreign language here] I: '42, _________________. A: Yeah. [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here ]. Good. So she arrived... A: [speaks foreign language here] I: She got the job when she arrived, a very honorable job, she had to peel potatoes. A: [speaks foreign language here] I: That was a work detail. So potato peel commando, yeah. Q: And where did you live first? I: Block B, One A, number one. Q: Number one? I: Block One_______ ________ One A. A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here]. After she arrived and put into block one at B one A, she was selected to work in the potato peeling, in the wo rk detail and then transferred to the Barrack 10, where all the potato peelers were in, okay? A: [speaks foreign language here] I:_______________ was beautiful, because... A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Yeah, see, they were , they were exempted fr om, from _______________. 15 A: [speaks foreign language here] I: She had, but there was, was one, one disadvantage... A: [speaks foreign language here] I: They had to, they had to grow up much earlier than anybody else because they had to be already in the kitchen where the peeling took place, they were sitting and peeling potatoes, yeah? But they had to be there before the whole camp was, was alarmed to wake up and before roll call took place. So that was the only disadvantage. A: [speaks foreign language here] I: And then she turned , then she became ill. A: [speaks foreign language here] I: But she reported immediately to the hospital, but she was warned don't do it, because if you will do that, you may be subject in selection for ______________. A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here ]. I'm always explaining to people generally, _______________ times, [speaks foreign langu age here]. I always e xplain that in the beginning, non-Jewish inmates were gassed too. [spe aks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] I: But she, as a non-Jewess was three times select ed. So when I made th e statement to several groups of people or individuals, that non-Jews, Poles and Germans al ike were gassed, selected, they were selected and gassed, just like the Jews, peop le do not believe me, yeah? And here you have a witness, who went through three se lections. But then later on, some of the researchers already _______________ sometimes it is mentioned, but all Jewish people do not want to hear that, yeah. Q: And it was through ou t the entire time, or did it become different? I: In the beginning. Q: In the beginning, right. I: And later on, I don't kno w at what occasion, I wo uld say, let's listen to her. [speaks foreign language here] 16 A: [speaks foreign language here] I: They stopped approximately in April '43, when the large influx of transports, of Jewish transports arrived from Holland, Fran ce, Greece and so on. Then _________________, when they discovered another thing, not _______ ________, was they discovered then , that the Jewish numbers, the tattooed numbers, [speaks foreign la nguage here], they did not, they couldn't distinguish all of a sudden who is Jewish and who is not Jewish among the women, by selecting and when the, when the switch or the change of polic y occurred, the Jews, non-Jews should not be gassed any more, during an in-house selection, because there were no transports coming from outside, where nonJews were selected like the Jews, but I'm talking about in camp selection, there was, they stopped when the big influx of Je wish people were coming. But then th ey discovered, all of a sudden that we are carrying the same number, the Jews and nonJews alike. So how to distinguish during the selections? With a man they co uld do anything they want as th ey were marked, but a woman was not circumcised. So they had some big idea we are going to supply, we are going to include a triangle under your number for Jewish women. And then when the triangle, the tattoo triangle was invented. And no one of thos e big shots who are now in res earch, engaged in Holocaust and Auschwitz research have the slight est idea why is the triangle is there. Now they started to put the triangle retroactive, but I was hiding. I knew what it meant an d I just took, I decided if I can go away without the triangle, I do. And I'm still runni ng around without the triangle of course it could have saved my life once in awh ile, yeah, but not always because yo u were not gassed before your identity not established _______________ anyhow. But you know, that ad hoc, ad hoc selection, I escaped many times those things because I had no triangle. Q: So non-Jews, when they were selected, it was only inside th e camp, it wasn't on the ramp, it wasn't in coming in. I: Never. Only the___________ ____ transports, let me explain th at to her. [speaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] 17 I: [speaks foreign language here ]. Most of the non-Jews were coming from jails, from police stations and then transferred into system of _____ ___________. [speaks fore ign language here]. If Jews were coming from a poli ce station, they were en tered as _______________ or_______________ and could not be gassed. A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here ]. Yeah, I'm just explaining that some difference between newcomers, from jail or________ _______ or yeah. What the diffe rence was administratively, even if a Jew went from police station in front of a judge, just for not wearing a star or for stealing a_______________ or who knows, but he was, he had some guarantee not to be gassed, he could be killed, he could be starve d to death, but he was not allowed to be gassed, b ecause he belonged to the same category of criminals, like the non-Jews. A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here], the description of certain categories of inmates are described in the secretaries of death, because those wo men were [speaks foreign language here]. Q: When did you meet Tsippy(ph)(ph)? I: [speaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here ]. As a newcomer, she had Typh us and [speaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] I: She had what? Why are you laughing? Because no, she had, she felt sick and she was diagnosed as a Typhus candidate. So, girls were standing there na ked, it was hot, waiting... A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Yeah, waiting for the SS doctor . They had all temperature. If the people were diagnosed as Typhus,_______________ patient, they were killed with injections. We had an inmate doctor there, an Slovakian doctor, under the name Anna Weiss(ph). A: Anna Weiss(ph). 18 I: And she took over. As the_____ __________ doctor arrived, she re ported not Typhus, but flu, flu, flu, flu. And she was a flu patient all of a sudd en and that was the mome nt she was saved from being killed. So [speaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here]. Ah, there were no doctors on, on, on, on, at the hospital, go ahead. A: [speaks foreign language here] I: No I, sorry. I propose to speak Polish... Q: Yeah, yeah, I understand. I: ...because it's easier for her, she can express herself mu ch better, she understands Polish, I understand Polish, so I can st ill ask question in between to get the more out of her. Q: Okay, that's fine, that's fine. I: Go ahead, _______________. [speaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] I: In those days Jews an d non-Jews were together. A: Jews together. I: Yeah. A: They were not together. [speaks foreign language here] I: In the barrack of the hospital. Now you arrived, you had to find yourself a bed, there was an empty bed, so you occupied it, okay ? Nobody advised you what to do? A: [speaks foreign language here] I: They were two in one bed, bed, yeah? And [speaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Oh, oh boy, full of hum an, full of human, um... Q: Waste. I: Waste? Good. And that was more or less the environment.

I: And they were Jews and non-Jews alike. Q: And what he did, he just touched a bed and th at's, that was the way he made selections, this person, supposed to _________________. A: [speaks foreign language here] I: She was an witness in Frankfurt, that's all she wa s _______________. A: [speaks foreign language here] I: And described the whole business. A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Some, somebody else go, how do you know that they were sent to the gas chamber. A: No. 20 I: So she answered, what did you answer? A: [speaks foreign language here] I: There were trucks. A: [speaks foreign language here] I: They were loaded onto the trucks. A: [speaks foreign language here] I: That's what we were witnessing. A: [speaks foreign language here] I: And then the trucks were... A: [speaks foreign language here] I: ...direction, went into the direction cremat orium. That was it? That's _______________? A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here]. Doesn't matter what kind, th at was no proof that they went to the crematorium, so that can't be why the [speaks foreign language here]. A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here]. That was her only answer when she was asked how do you know that they were gassed?

I: 20th of July she arrived to Barrack four and she remembers that it was very dirty, full of lice place and they didn't have a floo r, the floor was just a m ound. Then later on they put the floor and let me think what, what else has been said. Well, the, the... I: We had to sleep in the beginning, outside. I: Yeah and from the beginning they had to sleep outside. I: Outdoors, because they couldn't wait until the barrack was not put into order and cleaned. Because the men were livi ng before us there and that, they were not as good as a woman would have been by keeping the barrack clean. In any cas e, it was a dirty barrack . Full of all kinds of fleas, bugs. I remember there were rats too, bu t she does not remember. Rats. [speaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] I: See how,_______________ have used some poisoned gas for th e gassing and the, the, for, my God, they are not ev en using that any more, those things. Q: What, extermination? I: For extermination of the barrack. And so it's c ouldn't even enter or sleep there because after the extermination, which took place in _______________, it was smelly and we were afraid to sleep indoors because we had the impression that's the sa me gas they have used for the extermination, but they've used on, on humans, so it took awhile until the whole barrack was allowed, of us, we were able to enter, to breathe, to sleep and to work. 40 Q: So they actually tr ied to clean the barrack? A: Yeah. Because the _______________ neglected the whole th ing and the women were afraid to enter. Q: Now were the women act ually treating the barracks better than the men? I: Definitely, definitely. [speaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] I: I am going to translate, but I'm going to hist orically answer your question, okay? Because it was not 100 percent answer to be what you want it to be. If men were, if a woma n was, if our women were better in housekeeping than previously the me n, that was your question. Now my answer and her answer combined is that wh en the barrack was assigned for the administrative, administrative work details, to work and to be housed there, it was very a negl ected one, the male prisoners left for the male camp and we were assigned to that ba rrack, which was Block four, a wooden barrack. So disinfecting took place and then the women organized the barrack to be cleaned, cleaned, __________________, we had enough of water and scrubbing material , all wooden parts, floors, whatever we had were cleaned and was, the barrack was assigned for half of administrative activities, like the camp office, as the private room of the _________________ Katya and special room for the drawing office, of which I ____________ ___ became part, not part, but in charge. We were administratively part of th e camp office adjacent, but they assigned me to a private room where I could prepare my activities and, an d work undisturbed. What _______________ underlined, which is of importance, and among othe rs, end result of my, of the beginning of my career was that any trait, professi on or activity, which had to be perf ormed, like repair of the roof, laying of the floor, of the wooden floor, repairing of any insi de work to be done, erecting some walls up between, between the, in the barracks to, to, to have some partiti ons erected actually, to have an room, you see it was in big hall and then it was divided into certain rooms for certain activities, so the camp office was erected by putting ________________ wall and, and, and dividing that into a certain size. Then the private room also, top administrative inmate, like Katya, who was, became the report _______________ and another room which I, whic h was assigned to me where I 41 could work and was called the dr awing office. They had neglect ed the _________ ______ drawing office all the time, I don' t know why, I have been known ___________, known as the_______________ from the camp office, but I was actually in charge of the drawing office, in addition to, to, to the administ rative belonging to the camp of fice. So drawin g office became ________________ office of the drawing office. So I was _______________ from the [speaks foreign language here]. But, but she, especially on the ________ _______, certain functions could not be performed by a woman, because we had no know-how, like repair ing of the roof, the replacing of broken glasses, putting a new floor, building partitions to, to divide ________________ camp,_______________ barra cks, ___________, designated to us, into a housing or sleeping, sleeping area and another area, so there we had the first time, certain ma le work details who were coming from the mens camp to perform those activities. And what I just want to add to it, that because of that, the policy was, if there's a woman who can perfor m anything a man would have had to do, a man was, if ther e was a capable woman, able to perform those that did it as they preferred, a woman, because they wanted to avoid the, th e contact between men and women and that was always an opportunity to exchange certain views, to spread certain news, or words or whatever. And if that wouldn't have been the policy, I would have never obtained my drawing office, never have been put in charge of the drawing office, wh ere I could practice whatever I have been trained for, that means graphics, okay? A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here]. I have been just explaining what I said, wh at I've been adding to her previous statement and made my remarks th at while reading, while counting the kind of professions, which women could no t perform and therefore we had to engage male prisoners, well, in addition she added painters.

[speaks fore ign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Good. Block four [speaks fo reign language here]. So we ar e back where we spoke before. Q: Yeah, yeah, I know, but what I'm tryi ng to do is get at another aspect .

End of Tape 2. 44 Tape 3 Q: This is, my question is this... I: In plain English. Q: I'll be very, I'll try to be very plain. Katya wa nts to organize a block to help the prisoners, so that it will be... I: Reorganize, or organize. Q: Well, reorganize, yes, okay? Reorganize. W ho designs Block four and who allows her, who, who allows this building to be transformed so yo u have a camp office? A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here] Q: But why... I: [speaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] Q: Nobody knows? A: No. Nobody knows. I: No. Q: Do you understand that what I' m trying to figure out is why is it that Mendel(ph) and Drexell(ph) agree with Zanger(ph) to... A: [speaks foreign language here] Q: Katya. A: Yeah, with Zinger(ph). Q: With... A: Zinger(ph) Q: Zinger(ph)? A: Not Zanger(ph), yeah, Zinger(ph). Q: Z-i-n-g-e-r? A: Like a singer. 45 Q: It's like a singer, a Zanger(ph), Zinger, Zinger. Why did they agree to create this organization? If it's Katya's idea... I: Wait a minute, [speak s foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Look, there is an existing, an existing standardized, existing standardized layout for a concentration camp indoor, indoor establishment an d, and so, so, it isn't st andardized policy, we need_______________ where we need that, we need that. Only the size had to be decided. The, the [speaks foreign language here] Q: But the men's office ha d no drawing office, yes? I: No, never. Q: So how, how come? How come you, the women had one? I: Because we were adding a room, that's all. Yeah. [s peaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] I: It's the right person, it's the right time that you add. I: She said that was something that the reason that the men didn't have th e drawing room, there was something really new and really unusual that women in this barracks had a drawing room and then because of Tsippy(ph)'s(ph) talent, she was a very talented drawer and, and, and graphic designer, so that was the reason why they opened a drawing room in, in the Barrack four. A: [speaks foreign language here] I:_______________ was organized because of Tsippy(ph). Q: That room was organized because of Tsippy(ph)? I: Yes. Q: But do you understand, I don' t, I don't want to belabor the point, but do you understand my question? If Katya comes in to Anna's barrack, no w I don't know how you got into it, so just, one, one moment Tip, and she says she wants to reorganize. A: Yes. Q: What, what is she reorganizi ng? If, if the organization... 46 I: ________________, the ca mp. Reorganize the camp. Q: All right, but what is it before and what happened... A: [speaks foreign language here] Q: So she wants to change the... A: [speaks foreign language here] I: She had no intention to change, because she c ouldn't, change the system, but she wanted to exchange the personnel in charge of the inmates to be able to co nduct a more efficient organization _______________, but to, to obtain an out, an better out, yeah, so she switched from one inmate in charge to a better one. She was a very efficient pe rson, a very success orient ed person and all of a sudden she had here on one hand, a primitive prostitute from Rave nsbruck in charge of the Polish women who were wives of officers of and, and, and the high ex-Polis h officials, where the balance was impossible, I mean you can im agine how primitive Slovakian gi rl, even from village with a highly trained Polish intellectual, she could not de al, she only could be ro ugh and was not able to perform anything of what was as ked her to do, not even a list of an inmate because they could hardly write. So he or she matched the inmate population of one barrack to the people in charge, who will, were, will be able to conduct exactly what she needed to bring her system or the system in which, which was created by the Ge rmans in a certain way, to satisfy the Germans but not to serve the Germans, to satisfy the Germans and to help us. [s peaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Now you understand. Q: Yeah, so that the, the ________________ I: [speaks foreign language here] Q: Right. Are all German, it's, it's... A: [speaks foreign language here] Q: Yeah, yeah. A: [speaks foreign language here] 47 I: [speaks foreign language here]. What is, what was the question, what's th e answer? We had a private discussion. A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here]. She mentions the word political ________________, so I said, I added, [speaks fore ign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here]. Yeah, no I explained to her that I am taking the liberty to add and to clarify certain things which 50 historians, no 100 historians in 50 years were not able to do. We can solve that by adding the wording and explai ning the difference, exactly how it is, how it was and how people may, will be able to understand. And she mentioned [speak s foreign language here]. I added to it, registration. Because the [speaks foreign language he re] meant Gestapo and we were not Gestapo, but they, they had the [speaks foreign language here] Gestapo in the [speaks foreign language here]. And that is something not you understood before and not,______________ _ understood or explained before, not th e Auschwitz museum ever printed the [speaks foreign language here], that's all.

I said we make history right now. Q: That part I understood. I: By bringing something to th e attention for the first time, the difference which was never understood, never told and never even take... People could care less becau se so what? [speaks foreign language here]. SS, SS, what's the difference, yeah? And that's why we are where we are, in a vacuum. No, I will not ta lk any more. I said enough. A: Really? Q: Do you want to say any of it in English? I: What? 48 Q: What you just said. I: I told you what I said, I... Q: No, not... I: ...that I explained to her. I also told you that we may create oppositi on ____________________. Q: That I understand, but you... I: Then I told her the same thing, then I told her we may, we now have re ached the point where we were able to compare and to explain and_______________ feel that isn't, th at is an was an very important morning and she agreed. Q: But did you, you... I: What? Q: There are two different offices? I: There are two different systems. Q: Systems. I: Yeah. Q: One. I: The camp. Q: Right.

That was all, we had nothing but [spe aks foreign language 50 here]. Every employee of the SS was a Gestapo a nd the inmates who worked there worked for this Gestapo man.

A: No, not co llaborators. I: Yeah? Correct? A: Mm-hm. I: You had certain... A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Yeah, correct,_______________ they are not colla borators.

You can, you could refuse in the ca mp by saying, oh I am not capable to do it, let somebody else do it. So she went to Katya...

I'm just wondering if there's a certain... I: We don't know that. Q: We don't... I: The SS had no sessio ns in front of us. Q: Well then did you as prisoners have meetings? I: No. You received orders. I: [speaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here] 53 A: No, no, no.

Q: What was going to happen? 64 I: When they arrive, to know wher e they are going or what is going to happen, because they thought if they are going to be carried straight away to the gas chamber and they will know about it, that a mass of people, they will be able to revolt, yeah? Or to resist. Q: To whom did they se nd these, do you know? I: To, to ________________ to ce rtain people in Theresienstadt. Q: It was contacts that they had? I: Of course, yeah. Q: And how would, do you know how these were sent? I: Wait until she comes becaus e there was Tosha(ph) involved. You see that was ________________, I, I, I played an very important part, s ee I never spoke about it, but if you want to know I may mention somethin g and I wanted to speak yester day to _________________, but she, there was no, I'm afraid she' s not alive because since two week s I'm trying to contact her and just a constant busy sign. Finally I asked the_ ______________ operator yesterday to, there was only, the telephone, busy sign, but no conversation, so. Q: All right, let's wait til Anna comes back. I: Never made it my business to, look I cannot fight, on how many fronts shall I fight? Q: Tsippy(ph), I'm no t arguing with you. I: I know, I'm just asking, I'm asking myself, on how many fronts can I fight ? I have been fighting with, fighting, I mean_______ ________ fighting, all right? Since the Auschwitz exhibit at the UN, arguing about the, about the correctness, that's better, yeah, of the insignias, which was, they were wrongly interpreted, the Washi ngton Holocaust office, the Wash ington Museum produced wrong information, the Auschwitz people in the, what's the museum in Auschwitz? Produced wrong information, cause they engage d in so-called consultants, a famous ________ ________ from Auschwitz, who didn't know the difference between an, an, Jehova h Witness and an Jewish and a non-Jewish person who had a love affair with a Jewish man, they were differently marked, the women's camp had their own, yeah and I will probably sit down with you and explain to you my activities and my functions and my work in the drawing office. And then you will understand why 65 I'm objecting to the insignias, why I'm objecting to other things, to, to the plans of Birkenau in general. I have never disclosed to anybody because I've never been asked, never been understood what I did because to be, to have, I mean the historians don't even know how to read a map, to be quite honest, they don't look for the, for any clues which could be misleading. They are looking things from an entire different a ngle and I cannot blame them. Bu t if there comes some graphic artist, who, who was trained and wo rked all her life in the profession and is trying to argue about something of, of a graphic nature with an historian, it is an tragedy, yeah? Because I had cases where, was mentioned yesterday, I had to explain what a stencil is, yeah? By explaining what I designed for a particular, in a particular situatio n. So I'm fighting against many thing, it's not fighting, I'm just arguing about it and I always, I never had a real sympathetic ear by anybody to listen to me and it's, I've developed a situation where I suffer from an certain kind of loneliness, I cannot talk always to myself. People don't know what I'm talking about. I'm not quoted in any_______________ world famous hi storical literature because I've been living a world of silence due to my handicap, where I coul dn't hear, where I couldn't comm unicate and when I finally opened my mouth it was, I was totally isolated, misunderstood and too technical for their taste. No, now you know. Now let's come back to the aerial views. The aerial views as we've discovered is that they were, I mean for the purpose of explanation and important that they have inserted the plans and, and brought out the area they were, the area in question, but why couldn't they do the right thing, why have they used and copi ed the wrong thing, that is my, I am had no, no objections that they have inserted the camp, the women's camp on their aerial views. I've given strong signal, yeah? Can I call that... Q: You mean, you mean with a diag ram as opposed to a photograph? A: With a diagram, correct . But then they had not and you cannot even blam e the people what they did because from the first day on, the very first publications after World War 2, produced in Poland, by famous researchers like Dr. __ _____________ for example, he pu blished the very first book on Auschwitz and it's a good one, I ha ve that in both languages, in Ge rman and in, in, in Polish, which he forwarded to me because I, that's always activ e and tried to keep in touch with the post-war 66 Auschwitz family of inmates, I me an, it's not the families, but we go t a small family of people who tried to stay in touch with. That was in Warsaw in headquarters of the in ternational Auschwitz committee, under the stewardship of ____. An d then there was the museum and there are people who tried to do their best but th e world was not very sympathetic, they had no money, they had no, they were not very, we were not very popular because the world had enough in those days, so there was a stagnation of interest and after awhile people started to publish correct or incorrect. But then it comes to diagrams and to the drawings of the camp, there were irregularities, they were using some, they couldn't, tools, all those_______________ by fo ot, they had no experts to perform, they, to perform a layout of the measurement instruments, they had no access to th e camp building office, they didn't even know then that it ever existed. People, the historians who were trying to start to bring the history down to paper, had no idea that there was an Auschwitz official building office and so that those, that, maps and drawings and sketch es were preserved miraculously, yeah. We know today how the camp looked, we know and, but somebody was, _______________ sit down and _______________ complain. So the first plan was used, th e first basic informat ion was used from __________________, that document of, the Berlin planning of Auschwitz. I me an they tried and they still have enough of material and they had enough of material, but it was wrongly interpreted because the draftsman who was able to read the drawings, was not reading the historical background, yeah? If they would have done what I did all my life before I had to perform a drawing for my husband for his publication, I first had to lear n the text and to translate his scientific language into simple lines and diagrams. The people who were assigned to make the sketches of the first sketches after the war, were not presented with an historic backgr ound, they're not even asked to read or to understand what they are drawing, what they are doing and so we have know the after effects. Q: Tsippy(ph) where was the, where were the, the building plans offi ce? In the men's camp or in the women's camp? I: No, you can spot that in one of the aerial views or you have to [speaks foreign language here]. You know, we have now the same... 67 A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here] and if I would no t know the camp by here in my head, I would, I'm asking her where was that, the answer. No, it was not in A, it was in B, you see, because it couldn't have been but if you, she would no t talk to me about it and I wouldn't know, it would get lost. A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here]. We are trying to reconstruct where was this, you have asked me where was_______________ and I'm asking her in ad dition, where was ___________________? A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here ]. No, what is it now? Wh at do you want to know? The underground? Q: No, let's do the unde rground in Washington. I: Good. Q: Tell Anna we'll talk about the underground in Washington, I want to ask her something else now. I: [speaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] Q: What was your relationship with Tsippy(ph) in Block four? A: Our relation was good, I think. Q: No, but no, what di d you, what did you do together, did you... A: I was Block_____________ __ and she was in [speaks foreign language here] I: I was living in the borders of the block. A: [speaks foreign language here] I: I had a studio in the block, correct. Believe me , it was better established than any other studio here in New York City. I had a beautiful room, I even had b eautiful curtains, glass windows around. [speaks foreign language here]. Now, if I wanted to be alone and undisturbed, [speaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] I:_______________ was how it looked fr om the outside. 68 Q: So tell me. A: [speaks foreign language here] I: I had a window from the outside too. A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here] was next to her room where she was living. [speaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] [end of side one, tape 4] A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here]. You see, I ha ve a very important interv iew from Katya which had to be translated into a normal language. A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here ]. Did you understood? No. Q: You want me to get this transcribed and translated? I: No, no, no, no, no, I ha ve the transcription, I ha ve it transcribed, badly. Q: You need, it needs translation? I: I need somebody to type what I am translat ing from German into German, for corrections, editing. I don't need a German editor, I can do it myse lf, because I know the way of thinking of Katya and I know what she meant. I will need somebody who will, I may dictate that into an tape recorder and somebody's going to transcribe that in German. The goo d, good edit, good edition, which I am going to make. _____ __________ somebo dy translating from Germ an into English and then we'll have from Katya an very important statement, out of her own mouth, okay? And you know who did it, the stupid Susan, stupid Susan, an id iot, she was talking all the time and she didn't know and I gave to her instruction, question, A, B, C, D, she never sticked to. You know that Susan up til now had, did not produced anything, anything useful? A: [speaks foreign language here] 69 I: [speaks foreign language here], we have been the first 10 months in Ausc hwitz in the, some women arrived, the Slovakian women and some of the Germ an women, all the women in Auschwitz___________ ____ lager(ph), the first 10 blocks a nd then in September or August, we relocated to Birkenau and... A: [speaks foreign language here] Q: August 1942? I: She's __________________. I: [speaks foreign language here] I: It's not too strong for me , but be careful with that. A: [speaks foreign language here] Q: Right, not Auschwitz , ____________________. A: One and one week after [s peaks foreign language here] I: She just finished up speaking English ___________ _______, yeah? Q: But you came in 1943? I: No, '42. Q: '42. July 20th. A: Yeah. I: July 20th, that was her birthday. I: No it was a day before her birthday. I: A day before, I said, it was Hitler's birthday. A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Could you write something do wn for me? The name of Katy a's __________________, please. Do you have one sheet of paper? A: [speaks foreign language here] I: She had an coupl e,_______________ an couple [speaks foreign language here] A: Mm-hm. I: Yeah? 70 A: Mm-hm. I: [speaks foreign language here] A: Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm. I: So what next? A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here]. Now, front, you can wr ite in Polish or in, in, in English, Katya's __________________, Katya's maid, that's good en ough. Now, what is it? Q: Anna, what do you, what is your most vivid memory of Ts ippy(ph)? When you think of Tsippy(ph) in Auschwitz, what do you think of first? I: [speaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] I: In the drawing office. Q: Drawing? Serious? A: No. [speaks foreign language here ]. It was an in teresting person. I: Interesting person, ye s. She was interesting. Q: Was she funny? Sense of humor? A: Yes, yes. She was... I: A sense of humor. A: ...sense, sense, se nse of humor is very, very good. [speaks foreign language here] I: She had a great sense of humor. Q: Yes. I: And she has. A: [speaks foreign language he re]. That was her personality. I:_______________ a special personality. Q: Did she ever give you, di d she ever give you trouble? A: Trouble? [speaks foreign language here] Q: Huh? 71 I:_______________ trouble maker. A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Anna said that sometimes... I: It didn't went, if things didn't went my way, then I wa s giving trouble. I: She was trouble. Q: And what, what kind? I: [speaks foreign language here]. I screamed because they were constantly disturbing me and I had quite an... A: [speaks foreign language here] I: ________________, I worked at night, why? Because the, the Polish bloody underground, yeah, were coming for men, during the day the male pr isoners were coming, ga thering all the Polish women in my office, in my drawi ng office, throwing me out so that they can discuss their secret connections and messages. I we nt out walking around the camp an d having fun visiting all people and then at night I had to perform my duties becaus e I had to deliver. So then, sometimes, while working, or wanted to work, it was intellectually, mentally, a very demanding job. I performed many, many things wh ere I had to concentrate, where I had to be correct and where I had to, not wanted to be disturbed because it was sometimes a very delicate job I performed. So then anybody was coming in of those little monkeys and talking to me and, and so I started to scream, get out of here, because I have to work, yeah. And that she remembers, that I have th rown out many times. A: You see? I: [speaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Yeah. Q: You remember? I: Yes, very good. Q: Now, when you were talking to, stop looking at the bo ok, you were talking about the plans being sent to Terezín... 72 I: Oh, yeah. Q: And I want the two of yo u, because, does, does Anna know ab out this, was she... I: No, listen, may I as k something in between? Q: Yes. I: Anna, [speaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here]. Is possible, but I don't know. I: All right, [speaks foreign language here] Q: You're talking about them burying the plans in her, in her room? I: Not burying, but delivering. Q: Delivering. I: But she, it must not have been to her, I think it must have been either to Tosha(ph) Biankoffska(ph) and she didn't even know what it is, ye ah? Look, I must explain, you want the whole process okay, but it we nt through her room. [speaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] Q: So you don't know? A: No. I: No. That was underground work, okay? Effective one. Q: Tsippy(ph), you once said to me that before the family camp came, you knew what was going to happen to them, how? First translate fo r Anna what I said, so that she knows. I: [speaks foreign language here]. We suspected, we suspected, we have [speaks foreign language here], that was a reason, [speaks foreign language here]. That wa s the reason why we have tried to bring that to the attention of th e management in Theresienstadt wh en they arrive, to know in what direction, what the, how the camp was established and which direction was the crematorium. Q: Did you know that when they were go ing to bring in peopl e from Terezín... I: Yeah? Q: That they were going to bring them together as a family camp, before... I: We didn't know much, we didn't kn ow, we just knew when they arrived. 73 Q: When they were established... I: Yeah? Q: ...as the family camp... I: Yeah, mm-hm. Q: Were you surprised that they kept them , the men and women, the families together? I: No, no because in Auschwitz nothing, in Auschwitz [speaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] I: We were not sure what they are going to do, [speaks foreign language here], you see these, nobody knew, I think the pe ople in Berlin didn't know what to do with them, they knew somehow they are going to bring an end to the people of Th eresienstadt, but didn't know when the time was right. The political situation, how to camouflage thi ngs, how to pretend, how to lure the people into be able to be driven into the gas chamber without any resistance. So we were, nobody was sure the Germans in Auschwitz had no idea when, when and what orde r will come from Berlin, huh? I: [speaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] Q: Or understood. Now here's another question. The Gypsy camp is also men and women, the Terezín, the family camp is men and women. What is the rela tionship of the men's camp to those camps and what's the relationship of the women's camp? Be cause all the rest of the camp is divided by sex, pretty much. I: Okay, only, only the role call. Q: So you took care of, the women's camp took care of the role ca ll of the Gypsy fa mily camp and the Terezín? I: Correct. We knew exactly how many Gypsy women, Gypsy ch ildren, female, she does know that, because... A: [speaks foreign language here] Q: And Gypsy? A: Together. 74 I: Yeah, yeah. Q: No, no. I: [speaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] Q: Does that, does that mean that there were work details for the women from, from the... I: They were not working. Q: They were not working? I: No. A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here]. Only inside, inside necessary details for distribution of food and cleaning and so on. A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Yes. That's different. [speaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] I: They had, in, inside, what I said, inside activities like food distributions, looking after the children, they had a little bit of cultural activities because there wa s nothing else to do, but there was no physical work performed, like in our so-called [sp eaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] I: The tragedy was that they made no use, du ring a war, where manp ower or womenpower was short to use the young family members, me n and women for someth ing productive, yeah? Q: You mean the Germ ans didn't use any? I: No. Q: All right. And... A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Yeah, before them, before them, before they were gassed, they were asked to write letters, predated yeah? Predated [speaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] 75 Q: This is the Terezín family camp? I: Terezín. And so we have no_______________ the possession of letters, before dated, compared with the date of, of, with the date of death of thos e people, while they were gassed, so we know only now how they were luring and pretending inside of the camp, the whole situation, to prevent disorders or disturbances. Q: Is it... A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here], nobody wanted to believe any more because the information from the camp underground, or whoever was sending _ ___________________, Theresienstadt, the report what happened and then the predated letters, th e people in Theresienstadt and the world was confused. And that what the Germans tried to do, but what you don't kn ow is and you have not reported and never mentioned, [speaks foreign la nguage here]. Katya overheard once in an telephone conversation, while she was on her own, it is actually, but I'm not [speaks foreign language here], I wouldn't like to talk about it because it's very, very described what I have to say about Katya in one of the books of _______________ wrote in his last years. [speaks foreign language here], so let's bypass Katya, we are now back to Theresienstadt, yeah. The Theresienstadt _______________ from the [speaks foreign language here]. You see we, we received the, the lists of death simultaneously, simultaneously [speaks fore ign language here], so they, when they were gassed in the night [speaks foreign language here] and they were gassed, next morning, next morning, we already had the list of death and we had to administer that and, and absorb [speaks foreign language here], I was so [speaks foreign language here], with my head [speaks foreign language here]. So I'm tell you, we knew in the morning, they were taken at night, they were gassed. In the morning we had th e list and we had to take out the women from the livings in the dead [speaks foreign language here] and I had to change my [speaks fo reign language here]. A: [speaks foreign language here] I: What have I done at night, I'm asking her, she doesn't know. [speaks fore ign language here]. I will tell you that afterward. [speaks foreign language here] 76 End of Tape 4. 77 Tape 5 I: [speaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Now listen carefully. Don't you think that I'm sitting idle. I want to show you something, yeah. I want to show her something. Hold it for me please, yes, thank you. That's [speaks foreign language here] a whole book. I ha ve here a diagram which I produced, [speaks foreign language here]. I have here an diagram. In 1942 , what I'm saying on that sheet, I carry the information what an historian needs a whole book to write. And that mean s, where are my, where is my, yeah. It says, a year by month, 12 months in '42, '43, '44 and the beginning of '45, yeah? [speaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Every camp in Birkenau [speak s foreign language here], were frowned on, where female, women were located, so you will see, in 1942, [speak s foreign language here], women were there from March til August, clear? Q: Yeah. I: In B one A, the crosses are male, yeah? [speaks foreign language here] and there were women in B one A from here to here. In B... Q: B one B. I: In B one B, [speaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Here, here we went, we arrived in that part of Birkenau in June _____ __________ and we're there til '44 October. [speaks foreig n language here] what is it? Q: [speaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here] you see, the du ration of the Czech family came, where women and men were together and then in October '44, we relocated here, from here to here , [speaks foreign 78 language here], it didn't existed any more. [speaks foreign language here] you can read in B to, B to D, there were men and B to C, [speaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Yeah, that's the Hungarian camps are so-called. [speaks foreign language here]. Look, what I'm trying to show you, it's an diagram of th e history of Auschwitz, where you can see men and women, when they were there and ho w long they were there. Q: Now why? A: It's very important. I: Yeah? Q: Yeah, yeah. A: It's very important. Q: Yeah, yeah. But Tsippy(ph), why here , in A one, Auschwitz one stomlager(ph). I: Yeah? Q: There, aren't ther e men in those months? I: Yes. Q: But you don't have that there are men and women. I: Because it was, it was... Q: No, I'm just aski ng because here... I: You are right. A: [speaks foreign language here] I: I, I had no, I will, you are ri ght, I have to add, but no good . Why I have put here men... Q: Because they were together. I: ...and women together, th ey were living together. Q: Together, yeah, yeah. I: Yeah, you can see I made the connection here, goo d. So I have, have not found that, I wanted to bring out the women and not the men. Q: Yeah, yeah, no, no, that's fine, I, but it's, yeah... 79 I: I kept the men in the background. But, do you think it's an important diagram? Q: Absolutely. I: And for that an historian how many pages need? Q: It depends how much they write. I: [speaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] I: I am trying to show you... Q: So it's visually, it's very... I: For my future publication, I am prepared with many answ ers, with many simple, simple explanations and nobody can take that away from me. Come on. [speaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Okay? Q: Yeah. I: I'm sorry. Q: It's okay. This is the insignias? I: More or less. That's for myself. Q: Where's this from? I: That is _________________, and anybody else I will, wait a minute. _______________ was, we will talk about that, but I want to show you something more interesting. [speaks foreign language here]. Now I'll show you somethin g. [speaks foreign language here], I started something. I started the history of the SS. Th e SS [speaks foreign langu age here] with the ranks, their position, [speaks foreign language here]. And so I have when th ey arrived to Auschwitz and they left. [speaks foreign language here]. That is a sample, an ex ample. [speaks foreign la nguage here]. All SS members that ever been in Auschw itz, I want to bring on one sheet and have their history, with their rank and their position, on one sheet, instead of hundred other shee ts historians are writing about and sometimes... A: [speaks foreign language here] 80 I: [speaks foreign language here] Q: It's the light, the light went out. I: Yeah. Q: Yeah. I: Don't worry, that will st art to, to, to whistle. [spe aks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] I: I'm just trying to tell you that is an example, that is not authentic 100 percent, but I want... A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Here. [speaks foreign language here] Correct. [speaks foreign language here] to perform something like that, I cannot do it myself, all myself, by myself. I would love to have somebody who would concentrate on Auschwitz. I could teach him or her and I could teach him graphics, I could teach him. That is somethin g nobody does. It's just an exam ple I've selected on couple of [speaks foreign language here]. Now listen carefully. Do these here, that is something of big value. These two here, [speaks foreign language here]. That means in the categor y of German prisoners, women prisoners, into the categor y of German women prisoners we nt German women, the Austrian women, some, the Polish and the French women who had lovers , Pole lovers with, no lovers... A: [speaks foreign language here] I: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, stop it. Poland [sp eaks foreign language here] Q: You mean Germans who had Polish... I: Polish lovers and German women who had Fren ch lovers. [speaks foreign language here] Q: And these were on ly Christian women? I: They were only Christian wome n [speaks foreign language here]. Q: They didn't care? I: Huh? Q: They didn't care if the Jewish women... I: They went into [speaks foreig n language here]. If they had some relationship [speaks foreign language here]. You can see what I did. [speaks foreign language here] 81 Q: Jewish _______ _______________. I: [speaks foreign language here] Q: No, no, no, no, Ch ristian, not Jewish. I: [speaks foreign language here] Q: No, no. I: No Christian. Q: No Christian, but there we re Christians and no Jews. I: And no Jews, that's wh at I'm trying to say, [s peaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here] Q: Slovakia? I: Slovakia. I: Russia. Q: Russia? I: Huh? [speaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] Q: This is Italian? I: [speaks foreign language here] I: Romanian. Q: Romanian. I: Good. Q: Hungarian. I: Better. Q: I can't see this. I: [speaks foreign language here] Q: Greek. I: Yeah, better. 82 A: [speaks foreign language here] Q: ____________________. I: I did something [speak s foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] I: It started in Nuremburg. [speaks foreign language here]. Good, but why ha ve I done that because since the Nuremburg trial, they ask numbers of people who we re killed and they only mention Slovaks, and they mention Czech, but nobody realized that ther e were, there was not a single Slovakian non-Jew in a concentration camp, or at least in Auschwitz. So I performed the table where you can see everything which came under German category, everything which comes under Poles, French. A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Yeah. [speaks foreign language here] Q: I have a question for you. I: Yeah? Q: Given your chart. You once to ld me that when people came in, if they were born in Slovakia... I: Yeah? Q: But somehow they went to Poland and they were deported fr om Poland, they're coming as Poland, so how do you kn ow this is accurate? I: That is accurate. Q: This is accurate based on? I: I am talk, I am... Q: The origin or the transport? I: Transport, because we had no control ov er the, ________________ _______________ was entered as a Jew, Polish Jew, the second time that he entered, he was coming as_______________ Slovak. There are the figures and categories of arrival and not where they were born. Q: Okay. All right, no I just, I... I: If you come to America... 83 Q: Tsippy(ph), I'm not, I'm just, I want... I: Definitely, all this... Q: This is all I wanted to know, what the... I: Definitely. Q: ...what the basi s of this was. I: Yeah, you are looking t hose things from a different point of vi ew, but I am talking [speaks foreign language here] A: [speaks foreign language here] Q: No, but it wasn't like, I wasn't questioning this. I: I know that. Q: I was, all I want to do is the basis of it, that's all. I: Definitely and I'm telling you the answer. So I mean, it makes, does it make sense? Q: Yes, yes. A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Correct. [speaks foreign language here]. Correct. Correct.
