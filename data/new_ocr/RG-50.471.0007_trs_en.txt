I wore this white shirt and a red tie and belonged to Communist Youth Organization because that was politically correct. And the uh school I went to was not a private school anymore, as I said before, it was public school. And the whole life became on a different level. In order to be politically correct, the Young Pioneers, they sent everybody in the summer to camp in summer of 1941 and so happens that the camp they sent us was Palanga which was a seaside resort where I use to go every year with my mother in very very luxurious way and here they put me into big tents with many people sharing bathrooms and I wasn't use to anything like that. So at the age of 12, I figured I had to try to escape. And I figured the only way to escape is to some how fool them into that I had Appen- dicitis attack and maybe they'll send me home.

Even though he realized that I am faking it, he managed to send me home. That was in the summer of 1941, just a few weeks before the war started. That may have saved my life because when the Germans overrun that part of Lithua- nia, which was very close to Germany--I believe that most of the children in that camp were destroyed. SB: Tell me about the actually start of the war: what you saw, what you heard. AR: In about the summer of 1941, things were very tense but the Russians were still in full control and we really didn't know much. One morning, we heard all kinds of gunfire, bombs and guns and maybe by the next day, the Germans occupied Lithuania. It was not--there was very little resistance from the Lithuanians against the Germans: 'A' because the Russians were too strong, 'B' because the Lithuanians were very much pro-German and they welcome it. SB: Um, what other changes? Did--did you notice any changes just before or just after the Germans came in, in terms of Lithuanians? AR: After the Germans came in, and even before they fully came in, the Lithuanians started to commit tre- mendous atrocities. Actually cutting off Jews heads and putting them on fences.

SB: And so then the decree went out for the ghetto to be formed? Tell me about yours. AR: Did, uh, final time later, the decree came out that all Jews have to move into the ghetto. And it was very funny because they actually permitted you to trade houses with Lithuanians who lived in that part of town. The house which I lived in, belonged to a cousin of my father's. It was a very very beautiful house. So it was very easy to get a reasonably nice in the ghetto in exchange. And that took place and we actually moved into a house in the ghetto and those people who owned that house occupied the house we lived in.

And there was--the kitchen--there was maybe one kitchen--and you wound up having to cook over there maybe for 20 or 30 people. So I remember that we made little stoves out of sheet metal and we use to make--and--and we use to be able cook our kindling wood. That I remember very vividly. And so every room, more or less, had their own cooking facilities. SB: What about heating? AR: In the very beginning, there was enough heat. That particularly--that--there was a stove I think in every room. And that was used for heating and also the cooking facilities gave out enough heat and literally favorably there were many people in one room, it wasn't that cold.

The house we lived in was also occupied by a high ranking person from the ghetto police. His name was Gudinski.

I was a very good craftsman and I actually stole, a night, this arm band of his and I copied it with uh oil paint on a piece of canvas and my father put it on.

AR: He was scared just put it on everyplace because we were scared of the ghetto police. SB: You were scared that you would get discovered. AR: That's right. The ghetto police, not everybody was bad but not everybody was good. As a rule the ghetto police were not terrible but we really didn't know whom we could trust. And even the person who lived in the same house where we did, I really didn't--we really didn't know if we an trust him.

And Lithuania was a place where they use to bring German Jews and Austrian Jews to be liquidated at the 9th Fort and we use to do slave labor on the railroad. And we servance a uh whole contingent of German Jews, who came in, and they were brought in in regular cars--not in cattle cars.

And subsequently when we worked at the railroad, we use to wind up sorting out clothes because the German, very neatly, packed up and did whatever they wanted with them. And my father knew certain people from Germany or from Austria, from before the war and we actually came across clothing with the names which recognized. SB: Back to uh how the ghetto then kind of settled down into a routine again. AR: Yes, the ghetto settled into a lull--into a routine and there was a lot of work being done for the Germans in the ghetto. We had shops and we also had a trade school. The trade school was designed, in order to somehow convince the Germans that if they let the trade school, the children who are going to learn the trade, they were subsequently going to provide useful labor for the German army.

I was lucky enough to also having gone into that trade school. When I was there, I learned how to be Locksmith. I also learned how to do very fine Carpentry and after a while, I was good enough that I went to work in the shops, which is obviously a safer place. While I was in the shops, I did a lot of doll houses. My expertise became doll houses for higher ranking Germans; to the point they use to bring photographs of their houses. I use to scale them and build a doll house to mimic there house. Furniture, electricity inside--very very elaborate set- ups. SB: And tell me why it was safe with you?

And one day we had to return the valuables. They put up tables and people actually went and gave all their valuables away. I know we did.
