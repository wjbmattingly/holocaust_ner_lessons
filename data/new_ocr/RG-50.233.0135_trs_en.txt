A: No, ten, and then the camp commandant came in and told us a big speech that we are no more Walter or Johnny or some other name we all are numbers and the number is very easy to be erased and if you gonna behave you may see the freedom. If you don™t behave your freedom is gonna go through the chimney (he pointed chimney to the crematorium). Your freedom™s gonna go through that chimney. Q: What was your number? A: 14, 526. Q: And when did you arrive in Auschwitz? A: In 1941. Q: Do you remember the month? A: I think it was January, January 13. Q: It was cold? A: It was cold, yeah. Q: And what else happened to you when you arrived -- give you uniform? A: Yeah, they took us to the shower, take all you r clothes out and they give us the camp uniform and they divide in certain blocks. I end up in a block number seventeen right by the kitchen, block seventeen. Q: Besides given a number, were you given any ki nd of insignia or badges to put on your uniform? A: Yeah, they give three angle, red with a P on it. Q: Red triangle so you were a political prisoner? A: Red as a political. Q: Even though you hadn™t done anything? A: Even though I didn™t do nothing, no, didn™t do nothing. Q: Were there other American citizens, do you know of? A: Yes, there was three of us. Was Chenckk, Walter Chenchek and Domashevski. Domashevski is someplace in New Jersey. The Chenchek was here in Westchester County and he had two bureaus on Long Island, one in Riverhead, one in Hempstead. And with the Chenchek I was a very close friend. But Chenchek died about three years ago. Q: And were they arrested in Lublin like you? A: No, no, Chenchek was arrested in Warsaw and Domashaveski was arrested someplace in Radom. They™re different cities. Q: So you met them in Auschwitz? A: Yeah, met them in Auschwitz. Q: Did you ever try to complain or protest? A: Oh, yes. Q: In Auschwitz or? A: In Auschwitz so I got slapped in the face and kicked in the ass and shut up, don™t say nothing. Q: Were there any acts of resi stance either during the transport or in Auschwitz itself? A: No. Q: And what did you have to do when you were there? A: In Auschwitz we was building the barracks. I called it Noibaum group, building the barracks. It™s hard work but then the camp commandant a nd the doctor took all the teenagers and sent us to the trade shops and I end up in a cabinet shop. Q: Do you know where you were building these new barracks? A: In Auschwitz. There was about half of the ba rracks and most of them was one story but then we build the second story on it and build the new ones and outside the camp a lot of building was coming up too. Q: What barracks did you sleep in? A: I was sleeping in barrack number seventeen. Q: Were these made of wood or made of brick? A: Made of brick, everyt hing was made of brick. Q: And the ones you were building, were they made of brick or wood? A: Brick. Q: So this is the old part of the camp? A: Yeah. Q: And were you seeing a lot of construction in th e distance? Is the camp getting bigger at this time? A: Yeah, at the time even though was big group was going near the Auschwitz they called it Majdanek, Majdanek. That was new camp not fa r from the Auschwitz so the group was going over there and daytime was working and night wa s coming back. But meantime already I left the Auschwitz and I don™t know what happened but I learn later that was a very big new camp over there. QW: Had you heard of Birkenau? A: Birkenau, oh yes. Q: Was that the place that you™d seen or heard of when you were in Auschwitz? A: Birkenau or they call it Majdanek, yeah? Q: Majdanek as I recall, Majdanek was n ear Lublin. That was a different camp. A: Oh yeah, I™m mixed up, mixed up. It™s over he re in Oswiecim they call it, Auschwitz. They call it Birkenau, Brzezinka, sometime like that. Q: That™s the one. So you were selected to become a cabinetmaker? Had you volunteered? A: As a cabinetmaker, yes. He was asking every teen ager what you want to be, what kind of trade. I said I wanted to be a cabinetmaker so okay, yeah.. Q: Had you ever done that before? A: No. Q: What made you pick this new trade? A: Because it™s nice and warm over there and it wa s interesting for me. But the main thing I was looking for where it™s nice and comfortable, warm. Q: Who taught you to be a cabinetmaker? A: Was from Warsaw Mr. Buchwald name, real old guy and good cabinetmaker and I was apprenticed attached to his bench. He was a cabinetmaker, I was apprentice and he was teaching me. Q; Hw was a prisoner? A: A prisoner, yeah, he was a prisoner. Q: Polish? A: Polish, named Buchwald. Q: And how long were these less ons? How long did this last? A: I was with him close to two years. Q: Two years? A: Yeah, close to two years with him. Q: In Auschwitz? A: In Auschwitz, yeah. Q: And then what happened? A: Then I volunteer to go to another camp b ecause too much was executions in Auschwitz, too much executions and diseases. So I volunteered to go to another camp and they picked me up and I end up in Mauthausen-Gusen. Q: Now when you were in Auschw itz were you working on cabinets? A: In Auschwitz I was a cabinetmaker. Q: So you actually built cabinets? A: Yeah, apprentice building the cabinets and most of the things for army -- soldiers beds, soldiers racks for rifles and tables and benches for army supplies. Q: So these were not for prisoners at Auschwitz? A: No. Q: These were for the Germans? A: For Germans. Q: Now what did you see at the camp? You said th ere were a lot of beatings and killings and so forth. Does anything in particular come to mind when you think of these years? A: Yes, every day there was beating and killi ng and smashing the prisoners, executions almost every day, every day a pill, yeah and they called the numbers going to work so what happens they take them outside the camp and executions , shoot them. And I think I remember by the end I was there they brought twelve thousand Russian war prisoners to Auschwitz and as war prisoners, it was winter time, December, they was twenty four hours naked and a very cold night and snow even. Then they put them into barracks and gave them some kind of clothing but the food was very, very little so through the winter they almost all died out. There was only a few hundred left of those war prisoners. Q: Russians? A: Russians, yeah. Q: Were they put to work? A: No, no. Q: So they were just allowed to die? A: Yeah. Q: What about the rest of the prisoners there, who were they? A: Rest of the prisoners was Polish, Czechs, Ge rmans, Hungarians, we had some French, few British, three of us American citizens was there and Spanish, Spanish was there. Q: You mentioned British. Were these Britis h prisoners of war or British civilians? A: No, British civilians. It™s like me. Q: How had they been caught? A: They™d been caught in Germany, in French, and one was caught in Poland. Q: Were they treated any better or any worse than the others? A: No. Q: Were there any Gypsies th ere when you were there? A: Oh yeah, there was Gypsies. Q: And how were they treated? A: Gypsies were not treated good, wasn™t treated good. Q: Was anybody treated good? A: No, the worst treatment was the Gypsies and th e priests. There was couple, German couples., Kickerman his name was. He was big Communist a nd he find out any prisoner is a priest so he finish him up in a couple of days. So the priest was scared to come up openly that he is a priest. Q: So your kapo was a German Communist? A: Yeah. All the kapos was Germans and mo st of them was with the black triangle.. Q: Were there any Jews? A: Black and some was with the lilac color, lilac they was the religious, the Baptist. Q: Jehovah™s Witnesses. A: Jehovah™s Witnesses, yeah. Q: How were they? Did you know any Jehovah™s Witnesses? A: They was all right, they was all right. So far as I seen them th ey was not nasty. They was doing what they had to do but they was not nasty, they was all right. Q: Were there any Jews in this camp? A: Yes. There was one block with Jews. They call it Special Commando. The kapo was a Jew and the block, kapo, everything was Jewish over there. And they was going to work outside the camp but separate from us. Q: And you were in Auschwitz for how long? A: For about two, two and a half years. Q: So you were first arrested we said in January? A: January 13 in 1940 in Miendvyrec Polaski. Q: And you were transferred in Mauthausen-Gus en, do you remember when you were transferred? A: ™42, yeah, ™42, month I don™t remember but it was in ™42. Q: And how many from your barrack or your camp were transferred with you? A: It was about 4,000 men transferred from Auschwitz to Mauthausen-Gusen. Q: How did you go there? A: `By train and up in the Mauthausen railroad station we walk a couple of miles through the Mauthausen city to the Mauthausen camp which was there under quarantine for a week, about one week under quarantine. Then we marched on foot a few miles, about five miles to the Gusen camp. Q: What kind of train did you travel on? A: Cattle, cattle wagons. Q: How many people in each wagon? A: Full, as many as they push it in. Was like sa rdines in a can. If you want to lay down or sit down there was no room -- all you have to stand up. Q: Did you smell better or worse than sardines? A: Oh, we smelled, smelled. Q: Did you have any food? A: They gave us one loaf of bread and some kind of cheese. Q: Did you have any kind of toilet facilities? A: No, we stood in the corner of the wagon. Q: No barrel, nothing? A: No. Q: And this must have lasted a few days. A: Yeah. Q: What were you lead to expect? What did th ey tell you you would find in Mauthausen-Grusen? A: Well they told us we™re going to diff erent camp, we™re going to different camp. Q: How did the new camp compare with the old camp? A: The new camp felt much bette r and easier than Auschwitz. Q: In what ways? A: There was no beating, no killing, no executions, the food was little bit better but the work, the hard work, the hard work and the granite stones, that was killing us. Q: So you weren™t a cabinetmaker anymore? A: No, I was working a few months with the gr anite stones carrying the little and bigger stones, loading up the wagons and finally I was very weak and was eating my lunch, the soup, and finally somebody comes and pat me on the shoulder and said, how are you son? I look at him and some gentleman start talking with me. Who are you? From where do you come? From Auschwitz. From where? From New York. You are American? Yes. What was you doing in Auschwitz? Cabinetmaker. Are you know how to be cabinetmaker? I learn a little bit. I can do easy things. All right, you want to be cabinetma ker? Sure, I don™t want to be here in the granite stones. So I gonna try to get you to the cabinet shop. And his name was Luzion Buchwald. He was one of the first prisoners and he was an architect in the camp and he talked with the Arbeitgenes, that™s the S ecretary of the Labor and in a couple of days I was in a cabinet shop. And thanks to cabinet shop an d Luzion Buchwald I™m alive today. Q: Now this Luzion Buchwald was a prisoner, do you know from which country? A: He was Polish, from Warsaw. He was an architect from Poland and he was now in the camp as an Architect Bureau and doing some kind of architectural work for the Nazis. Q: I remember you mentioned someone, the person that you were apprenticed with in Auschwitz, this person wasn™t–? A: No, was a Karl Buchwald too. Q: They weren™t related? A: Was not related, no. Q: A happy coincidence apparently. So how l ong were you working in the quarry before you received this promotion? A: About three months. Q: If you hadn™t been transferred how long do you think you would have lasted? A: If I wouldn™t be transferred to the cab inet shop I think another five, six months. Q: And what? A: And then I would die. I was getting skinnier and skinnier and I was afraid I would get sick and if you get sick there™s no hope. You go to the hospital and instead of cure you they kill you over there. Q: How about the barracks where you were sleeping? Were they better or worse than in Auschwitz? A: The barracks I would say was comfortable. Wa s a wooden barracks, three stories beds and not crowded as was in Auschwitz. Q: Did you sleep alone in your bed? A: Alone, yeah. Q: So one person in each bunk? A: Yeah in each bunker which in Auschwitz was two in a bunker. Q: How long did you remain in Mauthausen? A: In Mauthausen, one week. Q: And then to Gusen? A: We marched to the Gusen. Q: And how long were you in Gusen? A: Another two years. Q: Again did you ever complain or try to get out? A: No, never came to my mind try to escape becau se I seen if a few guys tried to escape they got caught and killed so I never tried, don™t think to escape. Thinki ng that it™s gonna end some day, the war is gonna end and everything is gonna be solved. Q: So you were hopeful that this would not last forever? A: Yeah. Q: You were sure of that? A: Yeah. I had a very strong hope that Hitle r was gonna be finished and we gonna be free. Q: In the beginning it must have looked bad, H itler winning all of the time. Were there ever moments that you thought you would ever survive this? A: Well in Auschwitz, we had no hope in Auschwitz but when I came to Mauthausen-Gusen we had a little bit news from the Austrian civilians which was working with us as foremens and they are spelling little bit news what™s going on outside the world. Q: What did they tell you? A: They tell us Hitler is losing, Hitler is getting beating. Anothe r month or two be finished don™t worry, hold on to it, you™re gonna be free. Th ey was all right the Austrian civilians. Q: Were they pro-Hitler or anti-Hitler? A: It™s hard to say what they was but they was nice with us and some of them even bring some sandwiches for a prisoner, helping us. Q: Were they glad or were they sad that Hitler might lose the war? A: They was glad. The way I noticed th ey was glad that Hitler is losing it. Q: And you continued making cabinets until the end of the war? A: Yes, till the end of the war. Q: And who got the cabinets that you made? A: The Nazis. Here in Gusen in the cabinet shop we was doing the cabinets. We was doing cabinets, furnishing which the Germans was taking it. Q: How many people were making cabinets? A: Oh, it was about twenty six or thirty. Q: Like a small factory? A: Like a small factory, yeah. Q: How many do you think you were producing a week, can you tell? A: Oh was producing a lot, producing a lot. We had good machinery and good stuff over there and cabinets was coming out. Q: Who was your kapo in Gusen? A: Kapo in Gusen was Karl and he was one of the Jehovah™s Witnesses. Q: And was he better or wors e than the German Communist? A: No, he was good. Q: How did he treat you? A: He was not pushing, not beating, not yelling, just tells you nice and quiet do this and watch yourself. Don™t get caught with something that they beat you up and take your health away. He was all right. Q: Did he ever do anything bad? A: No. Q: Were there other Jehovah™s Witnesses working with you? A: One, one Jehovah™s Witness was a cabinetmaker. Q: So in general it was eas ier to be a cabinetmaker? A: Yeah. Q: And if you hadn™t been a cabinetmaker? A: If I won™t be cabinetmaker I think I wouldn™t be alive. Q: You wouldn™t be here? A: Wouldn™t be here, yeah, wouldn™t survive. Q: How good quality, I mean you were a slave la borer and a lot of other people were slave laborers, you were working for the German s, how good a quality were you producing? A; I would say very good, very high quality furnishing. They digged out someplace in the ground the oak which was black, black oak, not rotten, healthy black oak lumber and from the black oak lumber I know we did a lot of furnishing with the black oak. Q: So it was excellent lumber? A: Yeah. Q: How about the workmanship? He re you are working for the Nazis– A: Working for a Nazis and under their control from their blueprints and everything had to be done perfect. If you don™t do perfect they beat you up and they throw you out. I remember one incident Nazi came and give the order to make a picture frame. All right a picture frame and I got the measurements. I made the picture fram e and I finished. Couple took it and delivered it to that SS man and a couple of days he was comi ng with that picture frame to me, you made it? Yes. What size? This and this size. No, you son of a gun, he starts yelling at me. That™s the size I got it and that™s the size I made it. No! Took that picture frame and bopped it on my head and broke it into pieces and I had to do it over, the new picture frame, the bigger size. Q: Was that the worst thing that happened to you in Gusen? A: That™s the worst thing that happened in Gusen during the war. Q: So you made excellent work not out of love but out of fear? A: Yeah, out of fear because if you goof up some thing or you don™t work right so they throw you out and I want to stay in a warm shop and they treat us good over there. Sometime we get extra plate of soup and survive there. Q: I™m going to ask a slightly less relevant quest ion but keeping in mind the debate today about American productivity and Japanese productivity and Communist productivity. Do you think the workmanship in this camp would have been better if you had been treated better and if you were free? A: It wouldn™t be better, no, I would say was doing from all our hearts the best we could do. Q: But out of fear? A: Out of fear. Q: One could argue that the Germans were ineffi cient by treating people so badly that they were not getting as much labor from –. (First side of tape ended -- beginning of second tape) So you worked hard and you survived? A: Yeah. Q: And if you had been a free man what would you have been doing? A: I wouldn™t be working so hard and so precision as I did being afraid of tomorrow and afraid of losing that good job. Q: Would you have even worked for the Germans if you had been free? A: No. If I had been free I wouldn™t work for the Germans. If I had been free I will try to come back to the United States. Q: Which you were not able to do. A: No, not able. Q: How were you liberated? A: American troops came in. Q: Do you remember the date? A: It was May 5 and five o™clock afternoon 1945. It was all fives. 1945 May 5 and five o™clock the afternoon, the American troops came in. Q: Were you glad? A: I was crying, I was crying from seeing Am erican troops and being happy this is the end. Q: Were the non-ci tizens also happy? A: Yeah, those guys were so close to the tanks, I think it was five tanks came in first, they was kissing the tanks and kissing the soldiers in the tanks, everything, and they said that organize your own system here and wait couple of days till the army comes here. Don™t go away. The Nazis run away. Was no Nazis there so we rema ined ourselves in the camp, organizing our own leadership there and the next day everybody is going on his own. I stayed I think two days and with a group I went to Linz; it™s a big city. A nd over there again in some kind of barracks where was the Polish, Italians, and Russian farm labor s in those barracks. We was over there for a while. Q: Who were most of the prisoners at Gusen, do you remember? A: In Gusen, I™d say the most was the Polish and then Spanish, French, Germans, Czechoslovaks and we had some Jews there too, not many, but one barrack was the Jews. But they were treated good. They was not tr eated bad like in Auschwitz. Q: How about Gypsies? A: Oh, and we had some Russians, too. Russians we had and Gypsies we had. Q: Civilian prisoners or prisoners of war? A: Prisoners of war. Q: And how were they treated? A: They was all right. They brought them to Gu sen from some different camps. So they was treated here now like everyone else, not like prisoner of war but like a prisoner in a camp. Q: They were made to work? A: Yeah, everybody have to go to work. Q: But they were fed this time? A: Yeah, they had the same food what we had– Q: And the Gypsies? A: And the Gypsies was the same. Q: They were there too. A: There too, yeah.
