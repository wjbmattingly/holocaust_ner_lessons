ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 3 owned an international plumbing supplies business. There's the location. The arrow points a little bit further to the center of Germany than it should. He actually grew up in a town very close to the Rhine River and the French border. In this photograph is a picture of the school that Gerry attended, and this was a public school, and Gerry was the only Jewish child in that school. This photograph was taken in 1932, one year before the Nazis came to power, and Gerry is sitting in the middle row at the far right, next to the teacher. This next slide shows Gerry's family, somewhat later, after the Nazis came to power. Gerry's parents are here, and his sister Margot, who had the good fortune to get to the United States already in the 1930s. This is a very important document, to which Gerry is determined to return, and he'll have my head if we don't return to it. This document was issued to Gerry's father, and as you can see on the lower right, though you may not be able to read the signature, it's signed by Adolph Hitler himself. Gerry's father was a war veteran, and as late as 1935, the date here is May 3, 1935, Hitler personally signed certificates honoring, giving the Cross of Honor to World War I v eterans in Germany, regardless of whether they were Jewish. I'll let Gerry explain its significance later on. On the night of November 9 -10, 1938, justifying their actions with the death of a German consular official, who had been assassinated a couple of days earlier, the Nazi leadership ordered out the rank and file of the party, the SS and the Storm Troopers, to make an open season against the Jewish population. Some 91 persons were killed; at least, that's what the records say. 267 synagogues were burned down, and over 15,000 Jewish homes and businesses were destroyed ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 4 within the space of about 36 hours. Gerald's father was one of up to 30,000 Jews arrested in the day after the violence, and sent to one of Germany's three concentration camps at the time. He went to Dachau, outside of Munich. He was released shortly after, on the expectation that he would leave Germany as soon as possible. Gerry's dad and his mom, seeing that Germany was no longer a place where Gerry could be safe, were prescient enough to send him to Switzerland. He was one of a group of 280 children sent to Switzerland in late 1938, early 1939, and Gerry will tell you in more detail about that experience. He also came back to Germany briefly to pick up his visa and emigrate to the United States in 1940. Before he finished high school, there's a photograph of Jews arrested in southern Germany, before deportation to Dachau. Gerry traveled with a pass. His name was Gerd. Gerald is an anglicization of the German name Gerd. He traveled with a pass, and he sported one of the new passes, passports, that were demanded by the Swiss authorities. The initiative came from Switzerland. They wanted to know who coming from Germany or Austria, which was incorporated by Germany in March of 1938, was Jewish. The Germans were only too willing to accommodate, and this is the meaning of this big red J on the passport, which stands for Juda, the German word for Jew. Now, Gerry came to the United States and, before he could finish high school, volunteered to serve in the US Armed Forces, and went over and saw combat, pretty severe combat in Italy. After the war, after leaving military service, he was assigned as a civilian to the Nuremberg war crimes detachment, and there participated in several of the interrogations of top German generals. This photograph here shows Gerry on your right, prosecutor's assistant Robert Kempner facing the ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 5 camera, and with his back to the camera is the infamous German general Gerd von Runstedt, who had led the final German offensive in the west in the Arden Forest, which led to the Battle of the Bulge in late 1944. With that, I would like to introduce to you Gerry Schwab, and also note that his wife Joan Schwab, who is also a survivor of the Holocaust, came over to England in a Kindertransport, or transport of children, in 1939, is also here to watch the program. Thank you very much. Gerry? [Applause] To be honest with you, not even 2% of the whole story. 2%. Gerry, tell us a little bit about your childhood. How big was the town you grew up in? What were your relations with -- you were the only Jewish kid in town. What were your relations with other folks in town, kids and adults, and tell us a little bit about your parents, your father's profession, and their connections with Germany as their chosen country. >> Gerald Schwab: Well, I was born like everybody else, and went to school in Germany, in a town called Freiburg, which is not all that small, about 100,000. It's on the edge of the Bl ack Forest. I guess we were sort of a middle class. My father had a business, which was based partially in Germany, partially in Switzerland, and also a branch in France. This sounds a lot more impressive, but consider that these three countries were all about a mile apart. It's on the edge near where the Rhine River makes that bend. If you're across the river, you're in France. If you go the other direction, you go into Switzerland. The Nazis came to power in 1933. That's when life changed. ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 6 >> Peter Black: How old were you then? >> Gerald Schwab: In 1933 I was the ripe old age of 8 years. We went to Switzerland. The business, the warehouse that we had was in the city of Basel. Anybody has been in Switzerland might have been there. The Swis s were willing, we were able to get there, but they weren't willing to give you residency, so we moved a mile across into France. I had the pleasure then to switch, at age 8 or 9, to a French school. We stayed there a couple of years, didn't seem to work too well, and for reasons which are really due -- how should I say? Too difficult to explain. Let me put it this way: My father used to, later on, say "We get too soon old and too late smart." We moved back to Germany. And that document that Peter pointed out had some effect on that. We then moved to another German town, smaller town, called Lurag, separated from Switzerland by a streetcar. That gives you an idea how far it was. And lived there. Now, what happened, of course, is things immediately got more difficult for Jewish inhabitants. Last night I had the fortune of digging through my files. I came up with the list of anti -Jewish laws in Germany, and the first one which I have listed here was on April 11, 1933, that's basically immedia tely after the election, and over a period of years, there were 150, at least 150 laws designed to make life more difficult for Jewish inhabitants. If you wonder how they could pass that many laws, very simple, there's one guy at the top who signed it, and that was it. In fact, by the time we left Germany in 1940, 166 laws. These are some of them rather small ones. Germans were very good. They had laws, and they amended them, and amended them, and amended them. Some of them were serious. I mean, for instance, who could be ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 7 a veterinarian. Others, on the other hand, were a lot more serious unless you were, of course, if you were a veterinarian that one was very serious. >> Peter Black: Can you say, Gerry, can you tell the audience about how some of this legislation affected you after you returned to Germany, but before you left for Switzerland? >> Gerald Schwab: Well, it affected my parents more than, obviously, me. I went to a German school. The laws were increasingly difficult for Jewish inhab itants. In 1935 you had the famous Nuremberg Laws, which made it illegal to have any close relationship between German Aryans and Jews. At age 10, that really didn't affect me terribly much. But over time things became increasingly difficult. The n came the Olympics, 1936, when things eased off, although some of these signs "Jews aren't wished here" or park benches that said "Only for Jews" or "Jews are prohibited from using" were removed. They came back after the Olympics were over. And my fathe r's business became increasingly limited, certainly the German part of it, but he was still able to drive to Switzerland and sell his products. In 1938 there came an event which Peter referred to, the assassination of a German third secretary of the -- the German embassy in Paris, by a Jewish kid whose parents had lived in Germany since, I believe, 1911. They came from Poland initially and escaped to Germany at that time, because the father wasn't anxious to be drafted into the army. His parents, in 1938, were sent to -- well, they were pushed across the border into Poland, ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 8 saying "You're not Germans." In fact, nobody who came into Germany after early 1900s was considered a German. So they were either stateless or retained their Polish citizenship. They were pushed across the border. They wrote a postcard to their son, who was living illegally with an uncle in Paris, and went into the German embassy, saw the third secretary, the low man on the totem pole, and killed him. He did not try to escape. He was French. And in Germany this was the excuse that they really needed. They forced -- well, they basically, how should I say? They made the most of it. Jewish property was confiscated. Families had to pay -- Jews in Germany, large fines. The fact that hundreds and hundreds of stores, Jewish -owned stores, the windows had been destroyed. They had to have repaired at their own expense. Of course, in the meantime, they'd also been kicked out of the German insurance firms. It was really bad. >> Peter Black: Gerry, do you remember the night your dad was arrested? >> Gerald Schwab: Well, that was one of the first things that happened. My parents went from Lurag, where we lived at that point, to Freiberg. Obviously, somebody recognized him on the street, and he was arrested there and sent off to Dachau concentration camp. My mother, who was not a bad driver, drove the car back to our home. Obviously, a complete nervous wreck. I can't blame her. You didn't know where the people were sent, but as Peter mentioned, about 30,000 of them, 10,000 each to three concentration camps, Buchenwald, Dachau and Sachsnaw. >> Gerald Schwab: Thank you. The most direct effect in our family was this one Jewish kid in this one school was told he shouldn't show up any more. I was kicked out. Now, let me point out that this ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 9 was not a tragic matter, as far as I'm concerned. [Laughter] Especially since I was about to flunk Latin. My mother didn't see it quite that way. My father was in concentration camp about eight weeks. He came out. Keep in mind, this was November, December, Dachau was a concentration camp near Munich, city of Munich, and he was in really bad shape. Frostbite, he had all sorts of serious medical problems. My mother wrote to -- in the meantime, after Kristallnacht, this by the way is called Kristallnacht because, obviously, a lot of glass or crystal was broken. Some of the stores -- they didn't limit them, people didn't limit themselves to breaking glass. They decided to clean out the exhibits, too. So she wrote to an organization and asked, Can't you take my kid? Interestingly enough, about 10 years a go somebody wrote the Swiss authorities, and within three days we had a copy of my mother's letter. That's why I remember what she said. The reason she did is that shortly after the -- shortly after the Crystal Night, the British government said, We wi ll take 10,000 Jewish kids. As a former US bureaucrat, I must say it was amazing how fast they did it. They had something called the children's transports. They moved kids out, as Peter mentioned. This is how my wife, who was born in Berlin, got out of Germany. And I was one of about 280 people who ended up in -- they said right to the Swiss authorities. Well, my mother did, and I ended up being moved to Switzerland. >> Peter Black: What did you do there? What did you do once you got to Switzerland? >> Gerald Schwab: Well, the big thing is I found out very quickly I am not somehow born to be a farmer. ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 10 [Laughter] I ended up in this Swiss village of, I believe, about 350 inhabitants, and there was a farm. They had nine cows -- eight cows, some land around it. The village is in the center, then you have property in the outside, and the farmer, I must say, I appreciate it now more than then, they wanted to help me. But they figured that I would be happiest if I worked. They had lost a child about two years earlier. I was expected to take their place. As I say, it was not a very happy marriage. I learned how to milk cows. This was before the milking machine, by the way. That's quite an experience. I went into the barn, and the horse kicked me across the barn on the first time I went in. It didn't help matters. Anyhow, I stayed there, and stayed until about October, November of 1939. In the meantime, of course, the war had broken out. At that point, I was transferred. Somebody had pity on me, and I ended up with a fundamentalist Christian family, and I must say they were absolutely wonderful. They did not try to proselytize, they tried to help me in any way they could. Of course, the village, which is outside of Zurich, was also very small, but I stayed with them until May of 1940. In the meantime, during this period after Kristallnacht, Jews were no longer permitted to have automobiles or drivers' licenses. And as a result -- or Jewish males couldn't. My father could no longer conduct business in Switzerland. And by that time, everybody realized it's time to get the hell -- the heck out of there. The Germans were reluctant to let you go at that point, if they thought you had foreign currency or property overseas, outside of Germany. In fact, there was a law, there was a law that it was punishable if you did not -- anything against Jews at that period of time, we're talking about some ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 11 pretty heavy punishment, concentration camps, etc. We were not allowed to have property or funds outside the country, and in order to get the heck out of Germany you had to have permission. Well, until the Germans were convinced that you no longer had any access to foreign currency, they wouldn't give you the permission. Now, people may wonder over this whole period of time why Jews didn't just get out of Germany. Well, the young people at that point, who had not established a business or something, something equivalent, they left in 1933. And if you look at the statistics, it started there, and the number of Jews leaving Germany decreased year after year after year, until November 1938, at which point it shoots up. That's when everybody really got the idea. The reason Jews did not leave Germany in as large number as one might wish or wonder was the very fact that, A., some people figured this thing is going to pass, this is a temporary thing, Hitler is going to go like so many former governments in Germany. And then, of course, there was a big to do about German ex -soldiers who had been -- not only were soldiers, but had fought on the front. My father, during World War I, was wounded three times, and as we saw in this document, in 1935, two years after Hitler came to power, he still got an award. Obviously, many felt nothing would happe n to them. And then there was the third group that felt that they just couldn't leave. They had fought for the Kaiser, and some of the older people especially felt this was the only country they'd known, and they wanted to stay this way. >> Peter Bla ck: Gerry, when the visas came through, for your folks and for you, tell folks about how you went back to Germany and then how you got out of Germany. ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 12 >> Gerald Schwab: Well, my parents called. The Germans had finally decided that they could leave, and we had got a visa, or had registered for a visa, to come to the American consulate in Stuttgart. Some of the ex -GIs here, they remember that town. We went there. I was called back. I got a special visa to get back into Germany. We sat there in the waiting room of the consulate, and I pointed out to my mother, "Look." In the German newspaper, it said silly propaganda, the German troops are amassing on the borders, and it's just propaganda, it's not true. Well, the date that we got our visa was May 10, 1940. On May 10, German invaded Holland, Belgium and France, or attacked France. Up to then, they had something called the Sitzkrieg War, and that's when the war in -- European war really started. >> Peter Black: You physically got out through Ita ly, right? >> Gerald Schwab: Yes. We got our visa on the 10th. I think we went back to our town on the 11th, and I think we probably left on the 12th. Went to Italy, came to the States from Genoa, and fortunately the Italians declared war on the French, and the Brits, while we were at sea. Because, otherwise, that way of getting out of Germany would have -- well, at that point, it became impossible to get out of Germany. So anyhow, we got to the States. >> Peter Black: You were a teenager by the time you got to the States, right? >> Gerald Schwab: Oh, yes. I certainly was a teenager. I was -- I went to school, went to junior high, and end up with -- I lost some time in between. Now we're beyond the Holocaust period as far as we're concerned. My parents, father had previously, as I said, been a businessman. He opened up a poultry farm in central New Jersey. Any New Jerseyites here? Here? And I grew up for a couple of ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 13 years in Hightstown, and at that point my father told the draft board that I was an essential worker and asked for deferment. I called the draft board and said, "Don't you dare do this again." I was afraid I was going to miss this whole thing. Then, at that point then, I got into the army, spent a glorious period of time in C amp Blanding, Florida. I can use some cynicism, can't I? [Laughter] And went to Italy, and became a member of the 10th Mountain Division. To answer anybody who wants to know whether I did any skiing there, no. We had ski uniforms, but we -- I never skied there. >> Peter Black: You saw some pretty severe combat. >> Gerald Schwab: We saw some combat, yeah. That one picture, by the way, of me with Field Marshal von Runstedt, there he is, it was an interesting experience. I had been -- actually, at t hat point I was a civilian wearing an Eisenhower jacket. I did wear my combat hat. That's the one thing we were proud of in addition to that. It was worth $10 a month, if you had one of those. After the end of the war I was transferred to an intellig ence operation in Austria, and when time came to leave the army I was not an ideal soldier. In other words, I couldn't be a soldier nor a farmer. I ended up, as a civilian, at Nuremberg. Now, may I ask one question? How many of you know of the Nuremb erg Trials? Quite a few. In this day and age, cable TV, we have trials of the century all the time, nowadays. Well, the Nuremberg Trial was the trial of the century, because just about every surviving major German figure, except for Hitler and Goebbels, who committed suicide, were on trial there. Gerring, Hess. I was the interpreter, translator. Somebody is bound to say, This kid? 20, 21 years of age? How could he? ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 14 Well, as we say, In the land of the blind, the one -eyed is king. If you speak English and you speak German, this is it. So I spent, well, about six months at the first trial of the major German war criminals, had some interesting experiences there. I worked primarily with the German general staff. Here I was a corporal dealing with field marshals. One particular time I looked over, I was in what we'd call here the greenroom, I was waiting to go on, and the next witness was standing there, it was Field Marshal Kesselring, who had been the head of the German Air Force and also on the Italian front. So this corporal spoke with that field marshal about the Italian war. He asked me where I learned my German. I figured he had enough problems. He didn't need to know where I would tell him. But in his particular case, I did. He was personally a nice individual. So I told him. His response was, "They must be really satisfaction to be working here." The only thing I could say "You're right, field marshal." What else could you say? >> Peter Black: Gerry, before we open it up to questions, there's one more anecdote from this period that you have to talk about, and that was about that SR leader from your hometown. >> Gerald Schwab: Well, actually, he was the SA leader for -- the SA was a major Storm Troopers, was a Nazi politica l organization which endangered Hitler's wanting to work with the army, and in 1934 you had the famous massacre of the leadership of the SA. And after that, the SA never again was anything of consequence. They never had a position that the head was chi ef of staff. Well, the chief of staff had the misfortune of having an automobile accident in 1943. I think his car was shot up by fighter planes, and so the deputy, he was at the Nuremberg Trials as a witness. He wasn't tried there. He wanted to know -- let me explain. I was working in the section where the proceedings were ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 15 to collect information for the main trial, and you had one interpreter doing both German and English. The main trial, of course, was held in four different languages: German, Fr ench, Russian and English. But in this particular section it was only German and English, and instead of having a whole bank of interpreters, they had one person who did both, German -English, English -German. Which, by the way, resulted in a number of problems. When German field marshals started talking about some of their experience and so on, I -- what did I know? I didn't know the German. I didn't know the English. But I got through. This particular individual, head of the SA, which had been instrumental in destroying Jewish synagogues, stores, during Crystal Night, was trying to convince the hearing, or the people in charge of the hearing, that all they did was try to protect property. Didn't spell out which property, but it was basically all pr operty. And he wanted to know where I learned my German. I decided, No way. And I refused. Finally, the guy got on my nerves, after he had been talking about the work of the SA during Crystal Night, and I told him. I learned my German in Germany and I was there during Crystal Night. And, as my wife used that English saying, the penny finally dropped. He finally figured it out, and I was no longer bothered by him. >> Peter Black: Gerry, I'd like to throw this open to questions, with the mention that after the war you worked for the US State Department, had a whole career with them. I wanted them to know that. I would like to open the floor for questions that you might have of Gerry. I think there are folks with microphones on either side, so those of you who have questions, wait for the microphones so that everybody can hear the question. Thank you. ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 16 >> Thank you, Gerry. You're delightful. I have a question about your father. Why was he taken to concentration camp, and why was he released? Was that unusual to be released once someone was imprisoned in a concentration camp? >> Peter Black: Gerry, didn't pick up the question. I'm going to repeat it. Why was your father sent to a concentration camp? More importantly, why was he released shortly after? >> Gerald Schwab: He was sent to a concentration camp because he was Jewish. Simple. Very simple. They got everybody they could get their hands on, men between the ages of 16, 17 up to about 60. He was released, most of these people were released within about 8 to 10 weeks. Places like Dachau were not extermination camps. Dachau was a concentration camp that the initial inhabitants were workers, leaders, communists, etc., but by 1938 they were Jews had entry as well. The fact tha t he was a front camp, that he was a frontline soldier, got him out somewhat earlier. But I would say -- a number of people, obviously, died, some of them by suicide, running into the electric fences, but at that point it was not an extermination camp, it was a place for, as the Germans called it, preventive -- >> Peter Black: Protective custody. >> Gerald Schwab: Protective custody. Don't ask me who they protected. >> Peter Black: The basic purpose for the release, the purpose for the round -up was to provide some "incentive" for Jews to leave the country, leaving their assets behind, and people were released on the promise that they would get out as soon as possible, and that they would identify their assets, so that the Germans could seize them. ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 17 Any more questions? Yes, sir? >> Thanks for such a rich story, history. I was wondering if you could comment on the document that you're showing up on the screen before, and the implications and motivations behind it, hash out this document. The award to your father for his serving. >> Peter Black: He's interested in hearing you talk further about the document that we put up, and what its significance was for your father's decisionmaking process in the 1930s about getting out of Germany. >> Gerald Schwab: Well, it was actually the award came not from personally from Hitler, although he signed off on it, but the president, who at that point was Hindenberg, who was a German field marshal during World War I, who was a rather revered individual. It was a way of showing the country's appreciation for people who had fought for the war for Germany. I would say it was a -- well, a PR routine. >> Peter Black: What influence -- I think this was the core of the question: What influence did getting that certificate have on your father's decision making? >> Gerald Schwab: I think that particular document eventually resulted in the murder of a lot of people. People who would otherwise have left earlier stayed longer. This thing is going to pass; it's not going to be all that dangerous; we can afford to wait. In one of the publications of the Holocaust Museum they have a copy of that. It naturally caused people, certainly, to feel that there was a special privilege in having been a frontline soldier during the war of 1914. >> Peter Black: Any other questions? Yes, sir? >> With the movie "The Nuremberg Trial" was that quite accurate, or did they leave things out? ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 18 >> Gerald Schwab: Well, it was a fictionalized one, but yeah. It was an interesting, very interesting experience. Because you saw a great deal -- first of all, you saw a great deal of the German leadership, the top people, and I would say it's a fictionalized story. >> Peter Black: For the audience, the film that the guest referred to was the 1962 film "Justice at Nuremberg." The trial of the top justice ministry officials did happen. The names were historical names. Of course, Burt Lancaster was not one of the Nuremberg prosecutors. This was Hollywood, and it was sped up for the Hollywood purposes, but the general history is pretty accurate. >> Gerald Schwab: Since you referred to the Justice Department, I was -- after the Nuremberg, the first trial, subsequently there were about 9, 10 -- >> Peter Black: 12? >> Gerald Schwab: 12 other trials, and one of them that was scheduled was the justice trial, and the main defendant of that was to be a man by the name of Tirac, and I transferred for 6, 8 months to Berlin where all of the documents were located to prepared documentation for the subsequent trial. We worked very hard at it, except that we found out two months after the fact that Mr. Tirac had committed suicide. It was a complete waste. >> Peter Black: Time for one more question. I think this young man down here had his hand up. >> So your exact job when you were an interpreter, were you -- was it written German or spoken German? And during the trial were you interpreting the lawyers to the court, or what was your exact job? >> Peter Black: The question was, when you were an interpreter, were you actually interpreting during the trial, or where were you interpreting? ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 19 >> Gerald Schwab: The trial took place in the large courtroom. In addition, which is mainly forgotten, in addition to the 22, 23 defendants, there were also seven organizations which were on trial. Now, seven organizations, all with a large number of members. Everybody wanted to be heard. The idea was that if you were a member of the SS or a member of the Reich's cabinet, two of the organizations, that being convicted or if there were found to be criminal organizations, they should -- that would make life a lot easier for the authorities, the postwar authorities. And since there was so much information coming in, it was decided to have a separate hearing, or separate hearing for these organizations. For these organizations, they either submitted affidavits by the thousands, or had witnesses. For instance, general's staff was one of the organizations, and just about every member of the German general staff was a witness, either for or against the organization being declared guilty of one of the four indictments. >> Peter Black: You interpreted for those -- >> Gerald Schwab: And I interpreted for those organizations, for those hearings. We had fou r commissioners, usually one sitting. The chief commissioner was a man by the name of -- what was his name? It was a Brit, British colonel, 31 years of age. >> Peter Black: Harry Nee. >> Gerald Schwab: Harry Nee, who subsequently went back to England , became first secretary or whatever it is on the -- for the northern island. One day leaving parliament, his car blew up. That was the end of Harry Nee. Wonderful guy. >> Peter Black: Thank you folks very much for coming. [Applause] ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT NOT A VERBATIM RECORD 20 Thank you, Gerr y. As is usual in these events, Gerry and Joan will stick around for a few minutes, for those of you who have questions that you either didn't get to ask or were too shy to ask in front of a lot of other people. They'll be right down here. Please feel free to come up and say hello. Thank you very much for attending First Person .
