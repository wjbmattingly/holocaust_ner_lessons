Then from the side, th e people said to me, Itzrek, take off the hand from the pocket. I was holding the hand in the pocket. I took off the hand from the pocket so he didn™t hit me any more. Because you know, it™s a concentration camp. It™s not the shop anymore. Q: Your first rude shock? A: Yeah, when we were counted and everything, we went into a room to undress and to shave. Barbers that shave the head and they start giving us the striped suits. Q: The striped suits. A: I got a package. I put on the suit and we st art laughing. The pants are ma de too long, the jacket is too long. Moishe Rafilovich, he got too short a package, so we start exchanging between us. Dress, when there™s something wrong, we know we™re going into sewing, we™re going to fix it ourselves. So we were given a barrack where we should live. We come into the barrack, I always took -- there was three beds. I always took the top. Q: Any particular reason for this? A: Yeah, because I was always a little particular in things like this. To be clean because I know from the top when somebody cleans himself, the louses come down. You know what I™m talking about. Q: Yes, yes. A: The dirt -- everything comes do wn. So I said I™m going to take the top. So I always took the top. Then we went into the shop. It was a ne w shop they opened up. The customers from the old shop, they took all the packages what we didn™t finish, they took it with them to the new place, to the Skolna. The customers they have to come, they were advised that to finish the garments they should come to the Skolna. Okay. We stayed in this barrack and we went into the shop.

Q: You™re doing the same work as before and the same customers? A: Over there we got special to make dresses for the German women, wholesale dresses. We worked on the dresses. When I was working in the shop, somebody came in and he said Yitzrek your schragen is here. I said what? You know what a schragen means? Q: Your in-laws? A: Yeah, sister-in-law. I went out looking for her. I didn™t see any schragen. Then I heard a voice. She starts screaming Itzrek, it™s me, Dinka. Di nka™s her name. I looked at her. I didn™t recognize her. She looked so terrible, without hair, with a thing on th e head, a cover. She looked terrible. I said to her don™t worry. I™m goi ng to try to give her a place where to stay in the barrack. I tried when we make the dresses. I tried to give her a dress. I tried to see that she should have something to eat. I cannot go home to the barracks yet. So when the day was finished, I met her. We talked and she told me what happened. The kid, she -- first of all, she told me -- my brother got typhus. Q: Eli? A: Yeah, in Plaszow. She managed when she went out to work, she manage d to bring him a piece of bread sometimes. Q: So she was at Plaszow too? A: Huh? Q: She had been at Plaszow? A: Yeah, with the kid.

A: Went down and she can only ge t to my brother to replace a toilet, you know. She can throw over to him some -- she organized some bread. Th e kid was hiding in the barrack. Not a peep. That™s what she told me. One day, they took away from the place where she worked and they transferred her to me, to my camp. She comes in. Q: Alone, though? A: Alone. Without the kid. She sai d, I don™t know what happened to the kid. Q: Where was the kid when she left? A: In Plaszow. Q: But with --? A: In the barrack. Q: In the barrack with no one taking care of him? A: No. They saw the kid, they killed him. What else? Q: Eli was still sick? A: Eli was still alive when she left. But after th e war, I did find out that he starved to death in Plaszow. Q: You don™t know when that happened? A: No. So now I™m on the Skolna, huh? Q: Yes, with your sister -in-law and your friends. A: Yeah, we™re all together. Then the same thi ng happened. A transport arrived from Buzim. You heard of Buzim? Q: Yes, yes. A: When the transport arrived from Buzim, everything changed. With them came a lot of kapos. Not only Jewish kapos, other nationalities, kapos. Q: Polish, Ukrainian? A: Yeah. Because they liquidated Majdanek. They were sent here to our place. When the Buzim arrived, start stealing. The Buzim, they were our people but ---. Q: Thieves? A: I don™t know if they were thieves, they were bu tchers and all kind of people. Listen to this; I was sleeping one night on top of the barrack and I had a hand is crawling under mine -- like pillow. Of course, you know, if you™re hiding what you have under pillow, some money or something. On the Plaszow from the suit was hanging on the ceiling. I got sewed in there diamond. The rest was in the shop. So when I h eard the hand is crawling in and I was thinking what to do. I was thinking I™m going to get up fi rst and catch him. I got up first and I start screaming and I caught an undershirt. He was pu lling away a black undershirt. I have the piece from the undershirt in my hand and he™s gone. Q: You didn™t know who he was? A: No. I did find out. Q: From Buzim? A: Yeah. I start screaming and everybody on the lower beds, everybody catch each other. He was coming out from the barrack already. We was still looking for him. I have the place from the shirt. If you go around, where there™s an empty bed, maybe he run out from the barrack or something, but no empty bed. Q: How did you find out who he was? A: So in the morning, I reported to -- the diam ond from the Plaszow is gone, not hanging any more on top. Was on the floor. So next day I went to Friedman, _____ to Fishman, and they went to the Buzim barrack looking for somebody missing a piece of the shirt which was stupid. When we went in the barrack looking for the guy who was stealing, somebody came in and he said, that the kapos arrived, so forget about it. They™re going to liquidate us. That was not true. The kapos was still there. I didn™t know who took it. We still were there. Then one day, they™re going to liquidate the Skolna. No more Jews in Radom. So one day everybody has to go marching. We went marching. There was no tr ains, we marched by foot. We didn™t know where we going. We marched by day. At night they let us go in a tent (?) to lay down, to sleep. Some people, they couldn™t walk any more. If they know what happen, they would walk. A car -- not a car -- a horse and a wagon went in the back, goes with us, went with us. The SS said who cannot walk any more is tired, should go on the wagon. Near me was Mr. G_____, a little bit older than me and Mrs. Zucker. Her husba nd got killed on the sch______ when I told you was a fire, sabotage. They killed her husba nd and other people. They went on the wagon. When the wagon was full, the wagon disappeared. Then he came back, empty. Some other people, next time, they still went on the wagon. But later on, we saw something is not kosher. The second time, the wagon disappeared. The third time, nobody went on the wagon any more. Because we was sleeping on the field and th en one day they said water arrived to give us, to drink water. It was so a mess that they st art shooting. They shoot the people in the lakes. A lot of people. Then when they have to march again, yeah, they marched with bullets in the legs. They didn™t go on the wagon any more. But the last night, they were sleeping on the field before we went into Tomaszow- ________. It wa s a family -- what was the name -- Sinna I think. Was a mother, a daughter, and two sons. Sinnas. When we were sleeping on the field, they took off the corn already from the field. You know, was Œ the ground was soaked. Q: Wet? A: They digged. They start digging. They digged a hole in the ground. They were prepared for it. They digged a hole in the ground and the two Sinnas, the two brothers when they saw that it™s going to be light already, we ha ve to march again, they got in there and the daughter, the sister and this wife, they covered up. Q: So two brothers buried themselves? A: Yeah, they covered them up with dirt. They c overed them up with dirt and they got paper to put on the face and they got from bottles, the neck, th e neck from the bottles to give them in the mouth. Q: To breathe? A: To breathe. When daylight arrived and we have to go, they were sitting on this grave. On top of them. Because it was dogs also, they were sitting. Then when the SS were screaming, roust going, going. So they were the last ones to leave. Nobody should step on the grave, you know, nothing. And they left. Two brothers were there. They survived. Q: They survived? A: Yeah. Q: But you didn™t know that until ___? A: No, till after the war. Q: But as far as you could tell, th ey were left in the field alone? A: Oh yeah, they were alone. Covered up a nd nobody saw them and nothing. They survived. Q: These are friends of yours from Radom? A: Yeah, they are Radomen, yeah. The Sinnas, I knew them. Q: Now the people that had gotten on the wagons before -- they never came back? A: No. Q: Did you ever find out what happened? A: Yeah, we did find out later.
