A: Well, at that time I was -- I was doing diffe rent things. As a young boy I figure whatever I do, they wouldn™t do nothing to me, any -- but I do ha -- did have the guts to go and do certain things. Because when I was a little boy, I used to follow my father everyplace, and I see the way he was doing the buying, selling, and I was trying to do the same thing. Didn™t go exactly, but I tried at least. Q: So what were you selling? A: That time I was stealing -- we were on the border with [indecipherable] Poland and Russia.

I says, nothing. A young boy [indecipherab le] nothing, then go. As I™m going, they follow me back, stop it, turn around back the hors es. I came back, took out the hay, they find out a lot of material there. So they put on the handcuffs on me and put me in jail. Q: You frightened? 11 A: Huh? Q: Were you frightened? A: Yeah. Q: And where did they take you to jail? A: The date. Q: Where? A: Oh, they take me in Koretz.

So they told us, let™s make less people, because it™s a lot of people come in there, my [indecipherable] is gonna be higher. They want to have less people. So we had people waiting outside, my father and my mother tell people, don™t walk in, you know, but some people walk in anyhow, to go in to see what™s going on. So ta -- two or three times it took [indecipherable] finally they got me in the area, and they s how for the whole town, everybody should know that the guard that caught me as a blac k market and they had to put me in jail. They put me in jail for five years. So -- Q: So they wanted to make an example of you? A: Example for everybody to see it. Q: So five years sentence in Koretz, in the jail in Koretz? A: No, they send me to Rovno. Q: To Rovno. A: Rovno -- Koretz jail was just a small -- not big enough, so the big jail was in Rovno. So I was there for three months.

If you produce so much, then you get so much bread. But I was a young boy, I weigh [indecipherable] 80 pounds, so skinny like this. And everybody, all the big guys over there, they were cutting the trees and everything else. And then I used to go out to get my dinner. We used to all ha -- bring something [indecipherable] soup. As I™m getting the soup I seen a guy over there and th e guy looks at me and I look at him, I don™t know who he is. Then he walked up to me, wher e you from, and I tell him.

He was caught in black market, and he was doing the cooking. He was a cook. Now, to be a cook, you make like a millionaire over there. So then every day when I come to find my soup, he gives me a little extra soup. And later on at night he brings me a piece of bread. Q: What was his name? 13 A: Dilvert -- Dilvert, I forgot the last name. Q: So you survived because of his -- A: Th-Th-The -- the help and him -- the food was a big help, because the rest of the people, they were dying just like flies over there. Q: Dying of what?

And then they give me some rubber to put on my feet -- I mean the [indecipherable] that™s what I put on my feet. So then another guy came in and he got out -- took a tire and took out -- cut a tire and made a piece of rubber, and I -- that™s what I put them on, on my feet, and that™s what I used to walk, on the rubber. Q: How did -- how long did that go on? A: This was going on about two years. Q: Without shoes? A: No, they give me that rubber, that does better than shoes. It was heavy, the tire.

They cut it, but they show that I cut it, you know? Q: Now, what was it like in the -- in the barracks? A: Was it like? Q: In the prison, yeah. A: Pr-Pretty tough. We used to have one -- one [indecipherable] over there to cl-clean up the whole -- the whole room over there, 60 or 70 peop le in one room. And you come in everything is wet, and you want to dry out the stuff, so some days you dried it, some days you didn™t dry it, you just lay down and sleep with the wet feet. Q: Were you -- were you afra id of the other prisoners? A: I was afraid of what? Q: The other prisoners. A: Yes. Was only a couple in ther e to be afraid because they were real tough, and they used to -- see, we g -- used to get packages from home. So they send in the -- they send you some salami, some whatever, some food, and the other guys used to bring the food and hide it for -- I used to bring the salamis and everything el se and give it to the guy, the guy [indecipherable]. I said, take whatever you wanted, give something to me too. So he was giving more to me than he took for himself. The other people that were hiding, they took away everything with them, used to beat them up, you know. I was okay with that. Q: So you had some protection. A: A little, yeah. Q: When were you taken to -- to the -- this camp? 15 A: Ren? Q: When? A: I would say beginning of the 40™s. Q: So, it was in the winter? A: Yeah, yeah, it was real cold, and we got in [indecipherable] right away. The only thing you were praying to God you want to die, the same day you would like to die. And you want to go out and you want to do nothing, but then you go, and you walk in and you walk [indecipherable] to the police and he said to me, anybody make s one step behind is gonna be killed, you know? So a lot of people do it, they step 10 steps and the guy shoot them right away. So [indecipherable] you would go on, but you were shaking. [indecipherable] little bit more that I™ll tell you later. Q: Tell me more. Y-You mean people were committing suicide that way? A: Pardon? Q: They were committing suicide? A: I would like to, yeah, of course.

And you go and you™re real dry [indecipherable] the summer [ind ecipherable] and you want some water, there™s no water, but there™s a lot of wet over there. So you put your foot down like this, and the water comes, and you lay down and drink the water, the dirty water, I mean black like -- yeah. Q: And what was the food like? A: The food was real bad. You have to produce so much and they give it to you. But for -- if you done so much, they give you a bigger piece of bread. That™s -- that™s [indecipherable] good people, you know. So then the bread what they gave you was what do you call this, that da -- dry bread, real dry, it -- that you cannot bite the bread. You can never bite the bread, so -- and no water what to put on it, so excuse me, you ha ve to piss on the bread, then eat it. Yeah. Q: But it kept you alive. A: Thank God I™m here.

They steal a cigarette from you, if you don™t want to give the cigarette, you go into a fight. If you have an extra piece of bread, you eat, if the other one is hungry he grabs away from you and you don™t let him, he beats you up, because he™s the stronger one. And I didn™t look for fights [indecipherable] Q: And you were getting packages from your -- from home? A: Pa-Packages, yes. Q: From home. A: Yeah. Q: Still. A: Some -- some was coming in the time, and so me they got stopped before they came to me, and then we complain a lot to my friend lot - the -- the one [indeciphera ble] I tell him that I supposed to get a package, the package didn™t come in, so they ™ll start following up that the package was stoled. So they start looking into it, he says, if a package comes in you should get at the time. Q: So he was very helpful to you? A: Oh well, a lot. Q: Did he survive? A: He? Q: Da-Davide? 18 A: Yeah, he was a -- he was there. I don™t know, I left so I don™t know what happened. Q: So you -- you haven™t [indecipherable] A: When they took me out to the camp -- we were at camp, and they came in, they says anybody, Polish citizen could go if they want to do it, if you want to get out of camp you could go to the army. So I says, I™ll go to the army. Q: What made you think -- A: I was thinking this -- it wasn™t -- it didn™t bother me if I get ki lled, doesn™t ma -- matter, to s -- sooner it™s better. So I figure I™ll go to the army so maybe I™ll get killed in the army. So I was in the army for a few months, then I got shot over he re on my back. That took me out for a little bit and then I felt better, they put me back, put me ri ght in the front. So he™s put me in the front, I didn't know how to shoot, nothing. So they give me a truck, should drive a truck, and I didn™t know how to drive a truck even. So I was driving the truck and then I -- right after I got shot, so that took me off on this, and then they teach me how to shoot and they put me right on the front, fighting. Q: Where were you?

They need some gasoline, so I steal all the gasoline from the truck. [indeciphera ble] to give you some food. [indecipherable] Q: You™d never shot anyone before? A: And over there, yes. Q: But not before this? A: No, no. Q: So -- so what was it like, shooting -- A: The shooting was -- was pretty bad, but we were gone. It was the [indecipherable] that they were fighting against us. We had the partisans fi ghting them and fighting us. And then we were walking one day, and we see an -- a brother recognized each other.

We walked in [indecipherable] we see everybody was trying to be friendly with you in Manchuria. So I walked in one day and I get -- I need a dentist. I was -- toothache. So they take me into the dentist, they 24 walk in over there, they all run away because they see the Russians are coming in. I was there with another friend of mine. So we walk in [inde cipherable] they run away. I need some help for my tooth, nobody™s there. So I walk in, it™s a lot of boxes laying around, big boxes. And I open up the boxes, there™s all the things, gold -- gold pieces they put in for the tooth, you know? So I took the boxes, about 10 big boxes with the gold, and put in my car , and I left, okay? And then I kept it all the time in my truck. When I was going b ack to Koretz, I tried to take the gis -- gold as much as I can, and this survived me for anothe r two or three years, selling a piece of gold, buy bread, milk, whatever it is. And that™s was a surv ival til I started doing something for myself. Q: So you were an entrepreneur from the -- A: Pardon? Q: You were an entrepreneur -- A: Well -- Q: -- from the time you were 16. A: Yeah, I was -- that™s where the -- my -- my -- my older brother couldn™t do it. [indecipherable] was afraid of doing everything, so they send me out . My father used to stay to my brother, you have to go out take a look what he™s doing, he™s making money, you™re not making nothing. But he was afraid, you know? I wasn't afraid, I don™t know why. Q: And when did you find out what had happe ned to your parents and your brother? A: Right after the war. Q: After the war? A: Yeah, yeah. Q: So, during the war, what were you thinking? You -- A: Well, I was -- I wa -- I was hoping they™r e alive and I hope I™m gonna go and see them. 25 Q: Oh. And had you heard of Auschwitz? A: No, I -- I -- I -- Q: Had [indecipherable] A: -- I heard ab -- I heard about, yes. Q: So you knew the names? A: O-Other names, yes. Q: How did you find out about the camps? A: How™d I find out? From papers. People si -- fi nd a piece of paper, not -- it™s not the paper you go to buy every day. Somebody else ha s a piece of paper and he give to this guy, the other one gives to this guy, and you read the paper or they talk about it. Or, like I said, one could have a little radio. You get a hundred people, everybody wants to know what™s going on. It™s no radios like over here, I mean, nobody has nothing. Q: No iPods? A: No. Q: No. So you were a part of the Russian army in Manchuria. How long did that go on? A: Oh, with them probably about a year and a half . And then I didn™t want to be over there, and tried to go away. So then they had the deal that said that Polish citizen can just go back to the Polish army. If you™re a Polish citizen and you want to go -- instead to be in the Russian army, you could go to the Polish army. So I says, I™ll go to the Polish army. And were quite a few of them like this, about 50 people, and they were taking us back to go to Poland. There™s a lieutenant with us and I talk to him and I says, I would like to go, before I go to Russia, I would like to go to Koretz, to my own town, because my sister™s alive, I would like to go see my sister. Going back and forth was very hard to get a -- to get a paper that you could go there. So he sees 26 me wearing an -- a -- a watch. So I took out the watch, I gave him the watch. So he gave me a piece of paper I could go see my sister. So I went to see my sister to Koretz. As I come into Koretz, was my sister -- they were trying to kill my sister over there, the Banderowcy, the people what they are against the Russians. The Ukrainian -- Q: Part -- partisans? A: Yeah. Q: Ukrainian party. A: So, when [indecipherable] the paper, I says to my sister, I don™t want you staying here, take a look, they just killed another sister, another girl that she knew, another guy that he was active in - with the Russians, and he sa -- I don™t want you to stay over there, I want you to go with me. Let™s run away and we™ll go to Israel. She says, I can™t. I got my work over here, in the town, everybody knows me [indecipherable] for now, find out that they killed somebody else that was a close friend of mine, she got scared. She says , okay, we™ll go away, we™ll go to Poland. At that time we -- we™re still in Russia, we™re gonna go b ack to Poland. So she said okay, so she went away, and I stayed yet a couple days, and I left, too. And I met her in Germany, actually. Q: So the war was essentially over. A: Pardon? Q: The war was over? A: Yeah. Q: When you were in the army, did anyone ever say anything about your being Jewish? A: It was remarks from certain people what you got [indecipherable]. Nothing that -- some people gonna make fun, that you™re afraid of the army, you didn™ t go to the army, bu -- but no [indecipherable] not -- not too bad. 27 Q: So you didn™t experience any -- they -- they knew you were Jewish? A: Oh yeah. Q: No anti-Semitism? A: Yes. Behind the back they s -- they s-say something, they make songs, they make fun. I don™t know, there always something. Q: Did you have good friend in the army? A: Yes. Q: Non-Jews? A: No, Ukrainian. Q: Ukrainian? A: Yeah. Q: But non-Jewish Ukrainians? A: No. No, I had a non-Jewish friend too, yeah, one. But that -- that wasn™t -- the Ukrainian was real, real close with me, he wa s re -- older. He had -- he had the respect and he was always talking we gonna get together after -- after the army. As -- being with him in the army and we would -- he was a truck driver, too, backing up we used to hide the trucks under the trees at night. And backing up the truck, and he wants to be before everybody else. I was going -- what, we were kidding with each other. I want to back up the truck, he backs out the truck, he got explosion and he got killed right there, with the truck and everything else. Q: And you were okay? A: Yeah, thank God. Q: When you moved across the border, yo -- well, you ended the war in Manchuria? A: Yeah. 28 Q: Is that where you were when the war ended? A: Yeah. Q: And how did you hear about the end of the war? A: How did I hear? Q: Yeah. A: The same thing with someplace a paper, you know , people talk in radio with little things, but you got your -- a little bit here, a little bit there and you put together. Q: Is it -- what was the first thing that came to your mind when the war was over? A: How do I settle, where do I settle, what I do? But a young kid didn™t care what it is. Q: So did you think you™re going to move back -- go back to Koretz? A: In beginning I would say yes. And then when I see what happened over there, not too many left, that people this -- well, they came back from the army like I said before, this one was without a leg, without a arm, without a ear. Everybody had something, you know? So what I™m gonna see in Koretz? Nothing th ere. And the people, where they left, maybe a hundred Jews came back, maybe. Survived. Q: Did they stay? A: They stayed there for awhile. Q: For awhile. A: Yes. Q: Do you remember any -- any -- any of the battles you were in when you were fighting the Germans? A: It™s if I remember? How can I forget? Q: Well, tell me about them. 29 A: Like -- like what? Fighting -- it™s -- it™s -- that™s a war, they were fighting against us. It™s gonna be me or you, so I gotta fight you, right? So if I see something I keep shooting. Q: So what was it like to be a -- to be a soldier, an untrained soldier? They give you a gun, and -- and then what? A: Then I don™t know what to do. [indecipherable] got to show me what to do, because I got a gun, what I do? So they took us out for a couple of weeks, and they took us in a forest over there, just show us how to clean the gun, how to shoot, and doing the best we could, that™s all. Q: And did you shoot anybody? A: Yes. Q: You know for sure you -- A: Pardon? Q: You know for sure that you shot someone? A: Yes, yeah. Q: And did any of your friends get killed while you were fighting? A: No, not next to me. We were fighting let™s say a lot, we -- over there. Yes, some of my [indecipherable] were shooting each other then. Q: And the artillery, you remember the artillery? The cannons, the guns? A: Yeah. Q: The artillery. A: Yeah. Q: You -- did you -- you remember those -- those sounds? A: Oh, I thi -- I -- I can™t -- I can™t forget those sounds. 30 Q: Well, are -- are -- ins -- are th ere sounds that -- that trigger a memory sometimes during the day? A: No, not during the day, but during the night quite a few times, that you wake up and you think about it. Q: You still have nightmares? A: Oh yeah, it -- still, once in awhile. Q: What sorts of nightmare ? What kind of nightmares? A: Well the -- the thinking. The th inking the way it was over there, th -- one way is to thank your -- thank God you™re alive. Over there you didn™t think about it, but -- to be alive, you were thinking how to be dead. You didn™t want to be alive. Q: Even in the army? A: Yeah. Q: Any particular moments that -- that come back to haunt you and -- at night? A: A-Any particular what? Q: Particular moments that you recall. A specific -- A: Oh, place or what -- Q: Place where -- an -- an event. A: Well, yes, in Latvia we had a few things th at very scary because we start talking and the guy says, well, we have to go out and get the Jews. You know, then you start getting prepared in case something happened, you should know what to do. So then you start talking the other guys. And when I have my friend, th-the Ukrainian, and he says to me, well if something happened, don™t worry about, I™ll protect you. You know, we™re not gonna let -- you know, he says, it™s [indecipherable] anti-Semitism, he says, got good people, and you got bad people. He says, I™m a 31 good guy, he said to me, I™m a good guy, you know . But with [indecipherable] you a good guy, so we will survive, and we will be friends for a lifetime. So -- Q: So there was some anti-Semitism? A: Oh yes, yes of c -- Q: And you remember that? A: Oh y -- I™ll never forget it. Q: Well, have you ever told your s -- your family about this -- your experiences during the war? A: Ah yes. They -- everybody wanted to know, you know, when I came back.

Q: And how did you hear about that? A: Well, this was -- ran around because we lived right next door to them. My sister was there, I wasn™t there. Q: Oh. A: Yeah. [indecipherable] they live at -- 10 feet apart from my house. Q: You said your sister became the mayor. A: Yeah, after the war. Q: So you didn™t leave right away, because she became the mayor. A: No, this was after the war, when she came back. Q: But you stayed in sh -- at least she stayed in Koretz [indecipherable] A: Oh yes, yes, oh yes. Q: How did she become mayor? A: How did she come there? Q: How did she come -- become the mayor? A: Well, she™s -- just [indecipherable] is a very educated woman, and she was a very [indecipherable], not afraid of nothing, ever since she was a little baby. And then when 35 everything was done, when she had to run away, she wants to go to Israel, she wants to fight over there. And that was [indecipherable] that I shoul d go there, too. And I was going to go to Israel. I had a uncle and -- in Detroit that I never met, I didn™t know, it™s my mother™s brother. He was single and he had six sisters. And [indecipherable] kept everybody going. He was a businessman, and he want us to come over there, so he used to write me letters, I want you to come. And every letter he used to send me five dollars. Five dol lars was a lot of money. So I™m waiting for a letter all the time. And he talked me into go, so my si ster, she said she would like to go to Israel. So I said, okay, you go to Israel, and I™ll come later. I was in the trucking business, working for the UNRRA and so I [indecipherable] to about five trucks and I send her to Israel. So I figure when I come in over there, they told me it™s a real good business. So five GMC trucks and I bought a Mercedes car, and a Dodge car and I send everything over there. They came in over there, my sister couldn™t take them out because they need a lot of duty. I didn™t know I have to pay some of the duty. She didn™t have the money. I used up all the money to send it over there. Q: Where did you get the money to buy the cars? A: Over there? In Germany? In German -- Q: So you™re in Germany at this point? A: At that time in Germany, yeah. Q: Where did you get the money? A: Ah, back in black market. Q: Okay. A: Yeah. Q: When did you leave Koretz to go to Germany? You left Koretz and went -- A: When I left K-Koretz, that was 1945, to go to Germany. 36 Q: Right after the war. Where did you go in Germany? A: Near Stuttgart, called the Swasa Halfingen. That™s was a zeiling over there, was a little camp for the DPs. Q: DP camp. A: Yeah, and we were staying over there. Q: And you had met your wife? A: My wife I met when I came back to Koretz. Sh e was there, but that was just only a few days, and she was the only one girl left [indecipherable] from all the Jewish people. She survived. I knew her parents, because my fa ther used to deal with them. And we start talking now [indecipherable] going back to Germany, I said I™ m going to Germany, I have to run -- because -- because of my sister, I want to make sure we run away. So a few days later she came to Germany, to the same town I was at, and we got married four days later. Got a big wedding. We had four people. Q: Four people. A: Yeah. Q: Who were they? A: Huh? Q: Who were they? A: Huh? Q: Who were the four people? A: Ah, I was there. And the guy had a house, he let us stay over there with his wife and her brother. And [indecipherable] we brought in a rabbi and we had the wedding. Q: How did you find a rabbi? 37 A: There was a lot of them coming around [indeci pherable] was it a real rabbi or not, I™m not sure yet. But [indecipherable] paper. Q: So that was 1945 you got married? A: Yeah. Q: And you -- A: Actually ™46. Q: ™46. A: ™44 -- ™45. [indecipherable] Q: And then you engaged in black marketeering -- A: Say exactly, I didn't hear you. Q: You -- you -- you were involved in black marketeering. A: Yeah. Q: So what happened when the plan fell through to go to Israel -- to go to Palestine? A: What [indecipherable] but my sister told me that it™s a goo d thing you didn™t come over here, because then I have pay a lot of money take out the trucks. And it™s hard to make a living there, in Israel right now. And my uncle wrote the letter to come over here. I didn™t know what he is doing. He brought me into his house, you know, the bi g f -- big house, took me in and my wife, and at that time I came, I had my son with me. We stayed with them. It didn™t work out too good, because he, my uncle, is -- his niece was a single girl. When they brought me in over here, they always had in the mind I™m going to come in, marry that girl. When I brought my wife, wasn™t so -- they weren™t too happy. So when I find out what it is, I decided to move to go someplace else. So a friend of mine was from my own town, and he knew that I™m not getting along, but no fights, just I know that it™s not a good feeling there. So he said, move into my house. He has a 38 one bedroom house, and I moved in in the living room, we had a bed on the floor and we stayed together for a little bit. Then I got in -- I met a guy that is look ing for a job, so I find out the guy has a [indecipherable], and his wife was my older si ster™s best girlfriend in Koretz. So when he finds I™m over here, so he can start talk to me, what do you want to do in America? I says, I will do anything, I just want a job. So he took me out one day, he drove around with me. He said, I™m building here and I™m building -- it was a big buil ding. And then we pass by a lumber yard that says a -- a few Jewish people working over there, I -- I couldn™t speak nothing in English, you know. He said, maybe you want to work over here, I says good. So, next morning I went to work over there. And I worked there for a few months, and before [indecipherable] he came into me one day, he says, everybody likes you over here. I want you to be the buyer to buy the lumber. I said, buy the lumber for what? I don™t know how to talk. How do you gonna buy it? He said, well, I™ll hire, I got a girl over here, a Polish girl, and she™ll work with you together. You do the buying. I says, you™re making fun of me. He said no. So, before I turn around they made me the foreman, then I started doing the buying in the lumber yard. Q: What did you speak? What language? A: Mostly Jewish, and Polish. Q: But you -- so you knew Polish? A: Yes. Q: But -- but not English or German? A: No, not enough English, nothing. So, we worked there for awhile, and came back Christmastime, and I couldn™t go, I couldn™t drive, I didn™t have no license or nothing. So a guy used to pick me up all the time, take me back to work. And this was about 20 miles. But the guy was nice to doing it, because [indecipherable] the boss in there. But by about two years I was 39 working over there, and everybody find out with me I™m a good worker. And they don™t pay me too much. As [indecipherable] pay me 50 dollars a week, seven days a week, and I didn™t care, I make maybe [indecipherable] some body else [indecipherable] 75 dollars a week. So I go back to him, I tell, Harry, I says 75 dollars. He says, Do-Don™t worry about, I™ll give you 75. And then I want -- had -- need a car, so I got -- I got [indecipherable] license, I bought an old car, and I have to pay for the car, it™s 800 dollars. I haven™t got no money. So they say, we™re gonna loan you the money, and we™ll take off 20 dollars a week for your salaries. Okay. So it goes by a week, two, three, they™re not taking out the money. So I go back to him, I says, wait a minute, I can™t afford it, you didn™t take out the mone y. [indecipherable] the money, you ™re supposed to take it from the -- my salary. Said, no, no, no, you cannot do it. He says, you have to pay right now for the four weeks. Well, okay, I have to, I have to, take it all, the whole thing, you know. And then [indecipherable] he said no, don™t worry about it, the car is a present for you. You know, that made -- made a -- a big deal, yeah. And [indecipherable] open up the lumber yard [indecipherable] the two partners. They fight -- fighting between them and he come to me and says to me, you know what? We closing up the pl ace. I want you to go into business. You take over the place. I says, I™m gonna take over the place? I ain™t got no money. Then he says, well, we™ll work it out somehow. So, he went, he br ought me another guy, he says, that guy™s gonna go in partners with you. So another guy comes in the partners and start talking to me. He say, we™re gonna go into business, does he have any money. I says no, do you have any money? He says no. So what are we going? Says well, the people what you deal with them with buying, go into Mr. Martin, tell him that you want to go into business. So I go and tell the guys they™re gonna go in business. He says okay -- I-I -- I was buying for them. He says, show me your statement. I said, what™s a statement? I didn™ t know nothing [indecipherable]. So I stayed with 40 them for awhile, then I stay with a partner, and go ing to the -- to the banker that didn™t know me from somebody -- from the other people. I said th e same thing, I want to go into business, but I need money. Said the same thing, give me a statement. So, I don™t know what you™re talking about. Make the story short, the guy gave me 3,000 dollars credit, [indecipherable] give me 3,000 dollars credit. And we got [indecipherable] in the business, had good customers, the [indecipherable] was a big builder and he paid me every week. So I got in business and that™s -- I™m still in the same business. Q: I need to change the tapes real quick. End of Tape Two 41 Beginning Tape Three Q: Be-Before you tell me more about -- about Germany, let me ask you a different kind of question. Di -- do you remember when you hear d that your parents had been killed? A: Yes. Q: And you were with your -- with your sister at the time? A: Yes. Q: And what were your reactions to th -- A: I [indecipherable], but what can you d -- th-they were dead. So they not the only one, but you know, this, the other one, every day a different story. This one got killed, the other one got killed. Q: So gradually you heard about the whole family. A: Oh yeah, slow but sure, I think I got to know about everybody. Q: Did you ever think about religion, God, in all of this -- A: All the time. Q: What did you think? A: But what -- what I think? Q: About God. A: Was only one God and is -- God is good for everybody. You have to believe in it. Q: But did you think why -- why God is allowing this to happen? A: Yes. But there™s still a God, and you have to believe in it, and we hope for the best, and it™s gonna happen, someday, is gonna happen good, like wh en you™re alive. If you™re not alive, you cannot do. Q: So you just thought, there™s a mystery here and it™s something you can™t explain. 42 A: No. That very hard to explain. And someti mes when you ask the question it doesn™t come out. But when you walk away and you drive the car, or you talk with other people about something, e-everything opens up. Q: Like what? Tell me. A: The s -- the same thing which it has before, an d the things what happen, it™s coming out, it™s come -- it comes in the middle of the night, sometimes in the daytime, sometimes you got upset with certain things. Then you start thinking and say, what are you getting upset about it? Take a look. Thank God you™re over here. Yeah. But I™m still getting upset. Q: So it™s -- part of you is still back there, is that right? A: P-Pardon? Q: Part of you is still back -- A: Back? Q: -- back in Europe. A: Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I™m going right now back to Koretz. Q: Real -- is this the first time? A: Yes. Why I™m going, I don™t know. The reason I™m going there actually, because my son is on my back, he wants to see where I was born. So he wants me to go over there, he wants to see the place. And no Jewish people left there, nobody th ere. There™s the cemetery. And we build the cemetery. I gave a lot of money to do -- to make the cemetery there. And he was born in Germany, and he wants to go to the same place wh ere he was born, to see it. So that™s -- we decided we gonna go in September to go to that places. Q: Now, he was born in the DP camp? A: Yes. 43 Q: Are you -- are you anxious about going back? A: Am I what? Q: Are you anxious? Is -- are you nervous about going back? A: No. No. I was before, then I stopped. And then, when you start talking to me, now I start thinking, well maybe to go, let him see, and then see for the rest of my grandchildren, have to -- to know what was going on. Q: He knows your story? A: My son, yes. Q: And your grandchildren? A: Does he have any? Q: Your grandchildren, do they know as well? A: Yes, yes, and they are very much in terested all the time to ask questions. Q: You think it™s important to talk -- to talk about it? A: The way they asking me, I think it™s very important. Q: Why? A: Because if they want to know, they should know what was going on and not to believe in everything, and be alert [indecipherable] to know. That™s my feeling. Q: What do you think about all the attention th e -- the Holocaust and th -- and Holocaust survivors have been getting -- A: Yeah. Q: -- since the museum opened? ﬁSchindler™s List,ﬂ -- A: Should they what? Q: ﬁSchindler™s Listﬂ. 44 A: Yeah. Q: Lots of different movies. A: Yeah, yeah. Q: Academy awards. A: Uh-huh. Q: What do you think about all that? A: Well, it™s there, and everybody knows about it, and it™s a true story, everything. Q: So it™s a good thing. A: It™s a what? Q: Have you been to the museum? A: Which one? Q: In Washington. A: Yes, quite a few times. Q: You son is very active in it. A: My son is very active in there, and is -- every time we goes, he makes sure we go over there. [indecipherable] went there just a couple months ago. It was a big shindig at the time, with the candle lightening over there, so I was the one [indecipherable] candles [indecipherable] Q: For the mem -- memorial service? A: Yeah. Q: A-And -- was in April. A: Yeah, in April [indecipherable]. Q: Does it bother you to talk about it? 45 A: Depends what day. Sometimes yes, sometimes -- sometimes -- some place [indecipherable] ask a question, don™t ask for nothing. And sometimes they ask one little question, I could go for two hours and talk. Q: How do you -- how do you explain that? A: That™s -- it™s all very hard to explain, like I just said. I say nothing but the truth. Some day you want to talk, someday you don™t want to talk nothing. That™s all. Q: Have you spoken in schools or anything like that? A: [indecipherable] Q: Have you spoken in schools? A: [indecipherable] Q: Yeah. A: No, no. Q: Have you done interviews before?

And then I say yes, and [indecipherable] they call me to go on to do it, I said, no, I don™t want it. I was too busy, and I don™t want no -- things to come back to my mind, and I should thi nk about it all the time. And so I forgot about it, forget it. The same lik e I says to my son, I don™t want to go. If I go over there and I™m not seeing nothing [indecipherable] my house is st ill there, but I don™t se -- no friends, nothing. 46 Q: Mm. A: I have a few Ukrainian friends who they were real close friends, they were 10 - 15 miles away from us. And we are find out that they™re not alive. And [indecipherable] even I -- if I go to Israel -- I used to go there oftener, the last 10 years I wasn™t there. Every time I call up and I ask for somebody, they say, oh he is dead six months a go. Oh, he is dead two years ago, you know? So 90 percent of my f-friends, they™re not there. I don™t want to go there. Q: You said you -- you didn't want to think about it again, bring it all up. A: Yeah -- no, no, not think at all. Q: [indecipherable] A: [indecipherable] what we doing today, I supposed to go to Washington, and my son is on my back before we go, I want to see everything, to bring it up, whatever you feel like doing, talk.

Q: -- think about it at some level? What is that like? I mean, to -- to occasionally s-suddenly stop and have something come back from -- A: I don™t know. Maybe next day I™ll tell you so, right now I cannot tell you yet. For sure, it™s going to be a lot of [indecipherable] things to talk [indecipherable] things were to ask me, things what I™m talking about. It™s [indecipherable] Q: Is there anything you want to conclude with, you want to s -- anything you want to say to your children or grandchildren on the tape? 47 A: That -- if I want to say to them? Q: That you want to conclude with. A: Oh, it -- I always do, when they ask me with something. They were never too much interested, but the few times when I told one grandson and he asked me, he was very enthu -- he™s working for me for the summer. And I take him out to lunch once in awhile [indecipherable] Grandpa, so how did you survive? What did you do, how did you do? Just start talking to him. Then you talk to the other one, the other one came to me, he says, well, you talked to David, and you never tell me, I™d like to find out, too, from y ou. I said, I cannot tell you today, I™m not in a good mood. And I didn™t tell him that day, and he goes back to the mother, says, I asked Grandpa, and he wouldn™t say nothing to me. So they pass by another month or two, and it happened we talking about something, and I sa y, okay Michael, you asked me about something before, and I could tell you right now. Nobody™s here , it™s a quiet place. And I start talking to him. But he asked me to tell him that day, no. Now the same thing was -- today [indecipherable]. 15 years ago my sister begged me to do it, I said well, maybe I™ll do it someday. And somebody asked me to do it, the rabbi. I says, I-I™ll do it, I™ll do it, don™t worry about it, never done. I didn™t want to bring it up even. Q: What brought you to Detroit? A: Who? Q: What brought you to Detroit?
