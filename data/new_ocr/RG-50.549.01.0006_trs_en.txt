William Loew 3 at night and we had to stay outside. It was winter time. I don't recall whether this was December or January. I think it was December. It was already cold and it was already winterish. A lot of snow already on the ground. See Auschwitz is on the western part of Poland and it's pretty cold there. So, it was probably the end of December and we were outside. Apparently not knowing what was going to happen, but rumors were that there will be a public hanging and this is what happened. At dawn those five Polish men got hung. Before they were hung, I heard distinctly their outburst and their slogans for independent Polish state. Down with the tyranny and so on and then they were hung. We were outside basically almost all night and we were basically almost numb but only by the event that was shown to us but the physical endurance during the winter time it was quite vivid event. Q. They made you watch the hanging? A. Oh, yes. It was a lesson apparently for them to show to us what would happen if anyone would escape from the camp. Besides it was very difficult to escape. There were no cases that I know of to escape out of the Auschwitz camp. First of all, the camp was surrounded by barb wires that were electrified with high voltage that it was impossible. The only way you could possibly escape would be from some kind of outside work outside the camp William Loew 4 that you could probably sneak out, but I don't know of any cases. Q. Was there any physical abuse? Did you have anything happen to you while you were in Auschwitz? A. No, I was never abused per se, other than that general day by day intolerance and lack of food, lack of clothing, lack of sanitary provisions. There was one other event that I recall and that was something very interesting to me and to many other of my status because I didn't know that I was a ____________. A _______________ is a person who apparently by the status of the German or the camps regulations I was a person who has certain knowledge about things that they need to extract from me. Because when I was caught on the boarder between Hungary and Rumania, it was the time that they tagged me as a spy. And being as a spy I must have certain information, although they tried to extract this information back in ____________, that was one of the areas where they held me for a few days before they brought me back to Budapest. I didn't have basically any information for them, but they didn't know that. They felt I had a lot of information. I was a young fellow. I think I was 17 or 18 years old, but they felt that they had information. So, when they brought me from Hungary, from Budapest, it was a prison for political people, used to call it -- what was the name of it -- I forget. When they brought me from that political prison from Budapest to Auschwitz they gave me a special number, 193229, William Loew 5 without any prefixes and that was a number that was assigned basically to all those _________________, all people, prisoners that need to be preserved for a later time to extract certain information. But that was to my benefit because when there was a selection one day where they were selecting certain people, not knowing where they were going to go and I was selected to that group that I had to go somewhere, frankly I don't know where, they pulled me out because of my number. That was the first time I realized that I'm a ________________ and everyone else was curious about it and when they looked at my number they said oh, you are a __________________. You are a person to be preserved. That made my day that I was lucky enough to have that number. Other than those events, maybe there are some other events that I recall, very few. There was a friend of mine whom I was brought from Budapest also on the same train. There were only a few of us that we were brought from that prison. I think 13, that was the number that comes to my mind and ________ was another fellow that we befriended actually in that prison there in Budapest so we kind of stuck together making sure that we tried to survive. We were together and we tried to help each. I recall one day they were distributing bread extra bread to be consumed by us but the bread was very stale. As a matter of fact, moldy, and we were told later on that this bread was actually from another group from a train that was gathered from William Loew 6 those who were not as lucky as we were and brought in directly to the chamber and that bread is being distributed now among other prisoners. There may be some other events but I don't recall. There are only flashbacks that come to my mind. Q. You're saying the bread was for people who ended up going to the gas chamber? A. That bread used to belong to them and then this bread was collected and then distributed among the prisoners. Q. Can you tell me about the circumstances that led up to liberation, the weeks, the time what you remember about just before liberation, where you were? A. Well, liberation was not on our minds because there was a very bleak conditions for that. I recall being in Flosenberg there was little thing that I remember out of Flosenberg. There was the only event in Flosenberg that I recall is when President Roosevelt died. That was the time when all hopes that we had kind of vanished. Somehow we were connecting with his longevity, with his presence with our liberation. So, when he died, the hope also died within us, at least with me. So, it was kind of a bleak day at that time. I don't remember too much from Flosenberg. They gave us some camp money for the chores that we were doing over there and I don't recall the work that I had done for them, but I do remember I used to get some printed some type of camp money which William Loew 7 I have it still. One mark, and I met since a man who actually used to be in Flosenberg and he found me or I found him through my daughter Jennifer, who works with the Holocaust Museum, and this man, his name is Harry _________, who was trying to find other inmates, others who were actually in Flosenberg and she overheard that and she pointed out to him about me. We got in touch and we became very good friends. He visited me here last year and he has great memories he recalled a lot of things I still don't understand, don't know what it was but he knows it. He remembers a train that came to Flosenberg from Auschwitz and he says that train and those people who were on the train was a sore lot. Very, very sore and hardly walking people. I was one of them, of that train. Because we were on that train in open carts that they hauled us from Auschwitz all the way through part of Poland, part of Germany through ___________. I don't know all these days how long we were there, but we were frozen. I developed a lot of frostbites on my feet and which I don't recall any more other than I still have those physical remains on my toes. But Harry, he remembers. He knows what shape we came in and I recovered and I recovered rather fast because when we were about to move out of Flosenberg I felt pretty good. I felt strong enough. It was probably April the 20th or so, in 1945. When the rumors were that we were moving out of this camp, Flosenberg, to Dachau and we would be traveling. So, I felt William Loew 8 strong enough. I never met Harry on that and some of these columns that we were with the rest of my friends. There was one young man also from Russia that I befriended, a very nice fellow, but his face colors were very grayish and he didn't look good to me at all and I wasn't sure whether he's going to survive this trip. But I stayed with him. Q. You took care of him? A. Yes, I did, at time. Whenever he was really wobbly we were together and it was one of those nights that as we were walking and they gave us a rest and we would be resting in some of the ditches on the way to Dachau and it was one of those nights that he disappeared and I never found him. He was gone. Q. Do you know what happened to him? A. No, I don't know. I never met him. I never found him. He just disappeared from me that night. That was the time that we were completely exhausted, everyone was exhausted so that few minutes that we had to rest we immediately fall asleep and strangely enough even until today when i am very tired and try to rest I have the same feeling of succumbing into that deep sleep that I had then. It's a good feeling in a way because at least now I don't have to wake up for the next walk. Here I am safer. Q. You have that feeling when you're really tired? A. Right, right, and that still prevails. It's a very, very deep almost resigned feeling, and that still prevails. On the William Loew 9 one hand that's the flashback that I usually get when I rest and just before I fall asleep. Q. What kinds of associations does it have? A. It is that trip. It is that trip that gives you being exhausted, having no hope, just walk and no hope for the future, although it's kind of mixed now other than you're very tired. But that flashback always comes back. Q. How often do you have it? A. Whenever I'm tired. Whenever I am very exhausted. In fact, working here in my vineyard it's a lot of work involved and that's when I'm ready to rest, when I'm ready to take a nap, that's the time it comes in, that undescribable feeling, and that probably remains for the rest of my life. Q. Tell me, you never made it to Dachau? A. Right, I never made it to Dachau, none of us made it to Dachau. The only time that I remember is that this was probably a very nice day. Obviously we were liberated. It was April 23, 1945. It was a beautiful day at that time as I recall for a number of reasons. We were on the way to Dachau and I don't recall too much about that other than as we were walking in those columns, all of a sudden we heard some roaring sounds, and these were actually the sounds from tanks. It was American tanks and before we knew that, there were the guards who were guarding us as we were walking, all of a sudden were running onto the forest William Loew 10 because we were going through part of a forest. And they're running and apparently it was known already that the Americans are behind us and some of our inmates, some of colleagues were running after the guards. I wasn't capable. I was exhausted. Some people were in much better shape than I was. I don't recall from there on anything. Harry remembers alot of those things. Q. What's the next thing that you remember? A. The guards running away. Q. The American troops coming and what's your next memory after that? A. The next memory was where am I and with whom do I associate. Very little other than we are all of a sudden in no man's land. Basically yes, we are happy, but how and where are we going to go, and I don't recall at that point anything other than seeing those tanks roaring and thrusting ahead into the columns were actually split on both side of the road and the tanks kept on going. Q. Did you have any interaction with the troops? A. No, not at all. Not that I recall. Obviously we were very happy to see them. The only time that I recall of me walking into that village, and I think it was named ______________. That's the village that I recall. From there on I again, just a matter of recomposition of your own life. Q. When did you realize that you were free? William Loew 11 A. That's a good question. I wasn't sure. I'm not sure, but I was free I felt strange, but there's no question about it, I was free. The only question was from here on how do I recompose myself not knowing too much of where I was. What do I do from here. Q. What did you do? A. I didn't do too much. I went to this village and one of the houses that we stayed was which I recall very little, it seems to me that I ate but there is very little that I recall from there. Q. Do you remember your first meal? A. I don't recall although I remember that that was the time that my stomach was really upset for a number of days because of the food I was consuming or the food I didn't consume. So, it was a number of days before I realized that I had to be a little more reasonable with my intake. Q. You were eating too much? A. I don't know. Q. You just didn't feel good? A. I didn't feel right. It was just a matter I needed more of a rest. Rest and to gather my thought and to reconstruct my whole system. My whole system was out of order. There was a time that I recall when I was in one working on a road with some other of my colleague and a jeep came through with American soldiers. There were three of them and they asked us certain William Loew 12 questions and I was the only one that I had some knowledge of the English language, and they asked me whether I would like to join them because they're going to Bumberg, and not knowing where Bumberg was and not knowing where we are then, I felt that any place other than here would be an improvement. So, I said I would like to go with them, and they took me in that jeep and I recall that we were traveling for 10 or 12 hours overnight and they brought me to Bumberg, but they didn't know where to put me so they invited me to their shelters. It was a barracks. Barracks where the American G.I.s stayed. I remember this was the first division 16 Infantry and they invited me and I could communicate with them, and I stayed with them. I liked them. They liked me and they felt that they could use me for purposes because they did have a lot of German prisoners and I could help them in interpreting some of their cases. So, I became an interpreter and they gave me a uniform, a G.I. uniform --. Q. An American uniform? A. An American uniform, so I felt I was one of them and I stayed in their barracks. So, I wasn't a soldier but I was working for them. It was very interesting because I had now a chance to interrogate some of the German prisoners. So, I worked there for a number of months. Q. What kind of questions would you ask them? William Loew 13 A. Well, basically those questions were related mostly to where they're from. Their ranks, how come they were in the area of Bomberg. Mostly they were from the east part of Germany. Some of them were from the south part of Germany. None of them had uniforms. They all were in civilian clothing, but they were actually German soldiers. I don't recall of any SS people being interrogated, mostly ______________. It was questioned that they had to feel out apparently and to process some of these soldiers one way or another. They were not be released. They still had to be incarcerated for a time being but later on I remember a column of those Germans just left and maybe they went to a different camp. Q. What was your attitude towards them? A. My attitude was ambilivent. I didn't compose myself yet. I wasn't sure what to do with my life and I was confused in many ways. I wasn't angry in that sense. It doesn't mean that I liked them. It was just a matter I didn't want to have anything to do with them. Not that they were responsible for what was done to me or my family, they may not have been responsible, I don't know. But I didn't have enough time to build up the anger. The anger was there but it was tame. That's the kind of attitude I had at that time. Q. It was tamed? A. Tamed yes. William Loew 14 Q. You weren't allowing yourself -- A. I was controlled. I controlled myself a lot, so maybe because I was organized then. Maybe because of a lot of things that I wasn't sure what may happen or should happen to my life. But my main goal was not to be involved with things that will not relate to my life because I need to reconstruct my life. That was my main objective. How do you do that without any family, without any friends, without any advisors. You're on your own. You have seen a lot but that doesn't bring you to a point that you could do a lot with your life. Q. How did you go about reconstructing your life? A. I was basically very methodical in doing things that I need to do. First thing after when I used to live on those barracks I felt first of all I had to get out of there and to see what other things I have to do outside the barracks. And it was a good feeling to be there, but on the other hand I had to get out of there and to join the other people who actually in town. Also Jewish survivors, and in fact there was a committee that organized in Bomberg and I joined that committee. In fact they issued identification card for all of us who were actually in the area of Bomberg and I got one. I still have it and in that picture that you identify yourself I was in that G.I. uniform and it gives you certain information, where I am from, where I was born, the date I was born, and that I am William Loew 15 identified and that I'm registered in that Bomberg Jewish community. Then I found that while I was there I really didn't feel good. I was run down. It was a very false feeling that after the liberation everything is fine. Your system is fine, and this was a false signal. I wasn't fine. I was in fact in bad shape. I was run down, and I went to a doctor to find out whether or not what it is the problem that I am so run down. In fact I did have a case of tuberculosis. I go back to a sanitorium to be taken care of and that was from Bomberg I left to a hospital -- sanitorium rather than a hospital, to bring back my health and I stayed there for more than a year before I got help. Q. Where was the sanitarium? A. That was not far from Munich called _____________. In ___________ there were a number of us, none of whom I recall but there was one person that I met in ______________ whom I met in Budapest that was also in the same condition. He also got sick and he was trying to get better. So, I met him in Budapest and we all tried to survive in Budapest and it was a good meeting for him. We tried to recall the small events that we had together. ______________was a sanitorium maybe held three to four hundred survivors. They were all in run down condition and it takes a long time to really recuperate. It took me more than a year to recuperate. William Loew 16 But during that time of recuperation I took courses because I needed to get back into my schooling. So, I took the high school courses to finish up what I had to do, because my goal was back to the school, to college and to get a degree. ____________ was not far from Munich where major universities were and when I finished my high school courses I took an entrance exam into ________________ which is basically the engineering college in Munich. I passed that and they took me in and from _________ to Munich was a train and it was __________ there while I was recuperating. And I went there for two years and then I finished only two years of the major science courses before I left for ___________. That's in Bavaria. There's another place where we would be getting rehabilitation. It was a welcome sign that I was already in much better shape than when I came into ___________ and I stayed there for a number of months. I still didn't finish my school. I wanted to finish my school. I took some other courses there in ______________. Then I got a call from a friend of mine and this time it was a call from Umberg and that was a name it was not camp but it was a major center for people -- for displaced persons who were trying to get to the United States. Again, they were trying to recruit some interpreters for American Embassy to help out the process for the displaced person. William Loew 17 So, they recruited me as interpreter for those people. And there were all kinds of people there from different countries. There were Polish there were Russians and there were Slovaks and there were German Jews and so on, and the first thing they asked me to do is to interpret all their regulations into-- End of Tape 1 William Loew 18 Tape 2 A. Interpret that and write them into those languages that that person may be more familiar. So, all the regulations I translated that. Some were in Yiddish, some were in Polish, some were in Russian and German. So, I translated all those regulations in a clear language so that they would be comfortable with because they were not knowledgeable in the English language. That was my job plus the job was that I would be in presence of the I call them ambassadors, when he was interviewing the prospective immigrants. Q. American? A. American, yes. I stayed there for a number of months helping them out. There was actually three of them that I would work for. Q. Can I go back a little bit and just ask you between that job and before that job what did you do for money? How did you support yourself? A. Well, during the time that I was in ____________ that already was subsidized by the German government and given the time when I was in ____________ and that was only a few months there was also subsidized by UNRO. This was United Nations Relief Organization. I think that's what they called it. William Loew 19 So basically we were taking care of -- we didn't have any money but at least we were helped out by those organizations. Q. Did you have any possessions? A. I did not. I did not have any money. I did not have any possessions. I was -- I felt that I should have but I didn't. I was in process of getting there so it didn't bother me. Q. Clothes? A. That was again helped out by the major organizations so I did not have any income. Q. What did you know about -- you hadn't heard what had happened to your older brothers or your mother. During that period did you try to find out what happened to your family? A. Well, my family was decimated so I didn't have any hope for Abe, which was my older brother. He was killed in Lamberg. My mother was taken away in one of the actions, meaning they taken away thousands and thousands of us and my mother was one of them that took her away not knowing where. Most likely to one of the camps and we did have a camp in ______________ called _____________ camp. There were some massacres over there but only in terms of thousands but the real destruction camps were somewhere else, in Treblinka and some other camps that I don't even know. Now there were destruction camps in hundreds of thousands so I'm not quite sure but I think they took away my mother in one of those camps. William Loew 20 Q. You weren't able to find out for sure what happened? A. There was no way to find out. The only time that I recall about my brother Eli who apparently was in __________ camp and I was told that he escaped and I tried to rescue him and I couldn't rescue him to bring him back to the place I worked in _________ fabric, that was in Lamberg, _____________. I was one of the 40 Jews who were on the premises of that factory and when I found that when I heard that my brother Eli is in one of the ghettos during one of the actions that he's seeking my help, that was the time that I left the factory with armband using a W with a stamp of SS that I am in good standing working for the German ____________, German enterprises. I went to the ghetto to look for him and the way I understood from a lady where the place was apparently that Eli was supposed to be there and she told me that they took him away. I was too late, because I was going to bring him back to the factory. There were some other people on the premises but hidden in the factory. There was a wall constructed that I later found out and behind that wall were some members of the family of the friends who used to work there, and that was the time that I wanted to bring Eli to that place and most likely he would be able to work for us, but I was too late. After the war, knowing how resourceful Eli was, I thought he may have survived. There were all kinds of rumors that someone William Loew 21 saw him here or there and in fact I got a call, I got some information that Eli was seen somewhere in France, in Paris so I sent out all kinds of advertisements seeking him. I never got any answers to my search. So, I didn't find Eli. I knew about Abe that he was dead and my mother was gone to one of the transportation. The rest of the family, Aunt Miriam, she disappeared from us in the very early part of the ghetto. So, the immediate family was gone. The uncles and their families we were 80 people strong in our immediate family. They were all gone. So there was no hope for me to find anyone alive from Europe. The only ones that were left was one that I knew there was somebody in Argentina, Uncle ____________, and someone in Israel from my mother's side, the _____________ family and they were alive and it was later on that I got in touch with. Q. A little bit more about the job you had at the displaced persons camp in Homburg, but first I wanted to ask you -- Umberg, if you could tell me about some of the friends you made between the time you were liberated and the time you went to work at the displaced persons camp? A. Well, the friends that I cultivated since 1945 were probably quite a few and frankly I don't know where they are although some of them are in Israel, some are in the United States. There was a fellow with whom we studied together for college. His name is William Loew 22 _________, there were two brothers and they immigrated here to the United States. Another fellow who we studied also together he went to Israel. We kept some communication with each other. There's another fellow that I stayed with in ____________. His name is Rabinovitz and he left for Switzerland to continue to recuperate. Since that time he actually got married and he became a designer, a show designer and he was apparently quite successful in what he was doing. I did get in touch with him a number of times. There are many acquaintances that I have and had but we are so far apart that we didn't continue to cultivate each other because of the daily things that we had to do on our own and frankly I don't know where they are. There was one fellow who actually I got in touch a number of times Max ______________ who is in New York and he is retired now and so we are still in touch. Q. Can you pick up the story being in Umberg working -- and that's in Bavaria and that's 1948? A. 1948, yes. Q. And you were working as an interpreter for the Americans? A. Yes. Q. What happened there and if you can pick it up from there and you continued to get your life together? A. The work in Umberg was very interesting work. Apparently this was my first work place that I experienced in fact it was. William Loew 23 It was very nice surrounding. It was an office, obviously. I had an embassy office that we were processing the displaced persons, people who were trying to immigrate to the United States. I used to work for three -- I really don't know what was their title and I should know but I forget. But I used to call them Ambassador, there was Ambassador Mochay from Massachusetts, Ambassador Moody and I think Ambassador Frank and they were all nice gentlemen that I used to work for. In fact when I was about to leave the embassy and to immigrate to the United States all of them gave me a letter of recommendation for me to continue in my work and wished me a lot of luck. Especially William Mochay from Massachusetts. Then I tried to get in touch later on and was very unsuccessful, I couldn't find him. He was a very dear person. A very nice man. He was very sensitive and he was very a no nonsense person but he was very human and very reasonable to the all the applicants that he was processing. Q. What was the camp like? A. It wasn't a camp. It was a place, a building a huge building probably one time a German court or a German building that certain processes were conducted and it was taken over by the displaced people and an embassy was erected over there and they were processing those displaced persons. Thousands and thousands of those applicants were going through. For one thing, William Loew 24 the regulations that were prevalent at that time that no person who was illiterate must enter the United States. The people who were actually in good standing without any conviction, who were not convicted and people who were able to work were eligible to enter the United States. It goes without saying that the people had to be healthy and had to go through certain physical examinations and so on. These were the requisites and one of the requisites of course as I mentioned before is that they had to be literate and speak at least one language and must read that language. This is where I interpreted some of those regulations. Those applicants had to read in their chosen language and understood so that they could be productive citizens in the United States. There was one Jewish family that I recall that applied for United States and the way they were reading those regulations was suspicious by Mr. Mochay and he whispered to me saying that he doesn't think that they are reading those regulations and he was right. When I looked at them before they were sitting right in front of Mr. Mochay's desk, there were more fearful than anything else but they were not reading the regulations and I asked them in the Polish language whether they read the regulations in Polish and they say no. And I said well what language do you read and the woman said they don't read any of those that we have prepared for them. Then I turned some of these papers and some William Loew 25 of the regulations that I wrote were actually in Yiddish which had also Hebrew lettering but they were in Yiddish. I was sure that they would read that and to my surprise they were looking at it and they didn't read that. So, they were -- it proved to me that they were illiterate. I looked at Mr. Mochay and I said I don't think that those people read any of those papers because they are unfamiliar with those languages, although they speak them, they don't read them. Then I asked this woman what do they read and she said none of them and I looked at this man who had a beard and he appeared to me as a pious man and I asked him do you know how to ___________, which means do you know how to pray, in Hebrew, and he says yes. At that point I ran out of the office and looking for a Hebrew prayer book, whether or not he'll be able to read that. I open up the section where they have big lettering of _____________ and I brought this over and I showed it to him and I said read this. Do you know how to read this? And he says ____________. He read by heart rather than by the contents in the seder, the prayer book. When I went back to my ambassador Mr. Mochay, he said they don't speak any of those languages but they read Hebrew. And they did. He knew everything by heart and he passed the test. Q. And he went to America? A. He was processed. William Loew 26 Q. The whole family? A. The whole family because he was the household member and he was the one who would take care of the household family. There were some other acquaintances that I made in that embassy that I didn't know where they went. It was a short episode. It was a memorable episode. It was nice to work with them. Q. What were your goals at this point? It was 1948? A. It was 1948 and I kept on going, and now the goals that I had somehow to move out of Germany. The question is where do I go and obviously there is one possibility of us to go to Palestine which I got in touch with my cousin on my mother's side and he felt that the time was very bad at that time because the war was going on between the Israeli Jews and the Arabs. Another time that I felt that I may want to go possibly to Australia or United States but Mr. Mochay felt that I would have a good opportunities here in the United States. His name was Bill and occasionally I called him Bill but mostly Mr. Mochay. A very nice person, and he actually convinced me to come to the United States. Q. How did he do that? A. I really don't know what he talked a lot, he talked a lot about the United States. That was his favorite topic and he also got in touch with a Jewish agency for them to sponsor me to come to the United States and that's what he did. The Jewish Agency William Loew 27 actually sponsored me at his intervention I suppose because I never made that attempt, but he did. And so the papers went through without any problems and that year that was in '49 that I got my papers and Mr. Mochay interviewed me for this exit and it was a memorable day. I felt very good about it and I left and that was something in October 1949 that I left Umberg and all my acquaintances for Homburg and I boarded on a ship called General Hosey. It took us about 11 days, two stormy days and the ocean was kind of stormy but we finally arrived in New York. The process of entering as I recall was very simple. I didn't have any complications. My papers called for my name Willy Loew. That was the day when I went on a bus from New York port of entry and I arrived in New Jersey in Lindon New Jersey. There was two ladies that welcomed me from the Jewish agency. One of the ladies was named Mrs. Brown and Mrs. Slesinger and they were very nice ladies and they knew that I did not finish my schooling. They knew that I have some electronic background because of my schooling in Germany and the one thing that they wanted to make sure that I get a job and be on my own. That's exactly what I did. It was that I joined a family in Roselle New Jersey, their name was Kohn and I tried to get a job immediately and I got a job as an electrician, as an assistant electrician and to work my way out and I was getting paid I think 75 cents an hour. That William Loew 28 apparently was a good pay. So, by the time I finished a week I would getting paid like $25. I had to pay $25 to the Kohn family and that's what I got. I got paid $34.75. I owed them every week like a quarter. So, I didn't have any money per se and I asked Mr. White who was the owner of this electrical company if I could work some overtime to get some extra money, which he did and I worked there for a number of weeks. But there was a time where it was still difficult to work on those wages because I had to pay the $25 to that family of Kohn and I didn't want to be behind and I didn't have any extra money for myself. So my goal at that point in time was first of all get a better job, or a little bit more money and then go back to school. Now, I used to live in Lindon, New Jersey and the colleges, there was one Rutgers University, and Newark College of Engineering. Newark College of Engineering also changed recently to New Jersey Institute of Technology but at that time was still Newark College of Engineering. I inquired what are the prospects of me finishing my degree. They were good prospects but then I had to either go to school on a full time basis or go to school night time. So, it was obvious I had to go at night time and I could possible transfer all my credits from Germany onto this Newark College of Engineering which I wouldn't have had any problem of transferring those credits. William Loew 29 But there again, it was tough for me because that was back in 1951, beginning of '51 that my health actually was again questionable. So, I went back to sanitorium. Again my health wasn't in good shape so I stayed there again for another few months before I regained my health. During that time again I was preparing myself to go back to school. New Jersey is a very good state. They picked up the tab of the hospital. They knew I didn't have any money and it was in the sanitorium ___________ in New Jersey. When I got out since I had some electrical background, I joined a company called American Company and they were dealing with television installations. That was the time at first, that was 1950 and '51 that was when a television became very popular and I joined them and I had a very good prospect of livelihood. At that time they offered me $1 an hour and that was pretty good in view of the fact that the expenses were high but I could live on that and I was saving some money, whatever I could to purchase a car because I needed a car to get places and also to go back to school. That was my goal. The goal was clearly defined that I needed to get to school and lived in New Jersey from Newark it was about maybe ten miles or more so the transportation with the bus would be very difficult and I felt that I needed to save on my health rather than on anything else. So, I saved the money to purchase a car. I purchased a car, William Loew 30 called Hudson. It was a low gravity car. It was built like a tank. It was guzzling a lot of gas but it was good. It was a nice car and then I was still looking for more of a challenge for myself in terms of finding work that would pay me more but more related to engineering because at that time even working for the ACE which is the American Company of Electronics, I think that's what they called themselves, the owner's name was Gene Brown. Although they gave me work basically installing antennas on a roof which was okay at the time, but I couldn't see a future in that and I told them so that I would like to work on a bench repairing television sets, which he did eventually and I was repairing television. It came in kind of easy for me. I was able to fix television reading on my own the technology of television. Then I befriended a fellow who was already also a refugee but met him through another acquaintance. He used to work for General Instrument. General Instrument was a company that was building and designing television tuners, which is directly in the line I would have been for me working in an engineering atmosphere. I took an entrance exam with that company and I passed and I was assistant engineer to a man who was designing television receivers, television tuners and shortly after I was in charge of television receivers and television tuners evaluating and testing William Loew 31 them. While I was there, that was 1952 and 1953, I applied for admittance for Newark College of Engineering and while I was working during the day, I was able to go at night to school to complete my engineering degree. In 1955 I got my degree in engineering and from there on I was working with General Instrument. A very fine company in engineering. I made very good friends there, in fact, friends that we are still together. Ron ______________ that later on from General Instrument from Elizabeth New Jersey we moved out to Newark New Jersey and I met him over there in this company which was a part of General Instrument and Sid ____________ who was a mechanical engineer. Sylvan __________ was an electronic engineer, Sid was a mechanical engineer. I myself was also an engineer working with them together designing television tuners. Well, they're all retired now and after four years of communication we're still together and occasionally get together on special events, mostly weddings and occasional visits from them and we visit them occasionally. The time flies back in a hurry because it's when you work for a certain company you continue, you need to expand your experience and I worked for General Instrument since 1952 until 1960 I think and at that time I recall that I got a call from a friend of mine who joined the Ford company in Philadelphia and he told me that there is an opening for a project at the Ford William Loew 32 Company to do some design work and I felt that this would be an opportunity for me to join that company plus gaining some more experience in electronics. And I moved at that time from New Jersey to Philadelphia. This was a contract by Ford Company by the government, Spread Eagle, that's what they called it. That's how they had to hire so many people for this particular project. It happened so that the Ford Company lost the contract for a reason that I don't know and I felt that I'm not going to wait for another project. But that Ford Company and I was looking for another job and another opportunity came in St. Louis. In St. Louis a company called Emerson Electric were designing fire control systems for B-58. So they were recruiting engineers and I applied for that position and I worked there in Emerson Electric for a number of years. At least three years I think. This was '59 to 1962. And I gained a lot of experience there. And the engineers at that time were known as the gypsies because they were moving from place to place and I was offered another position in Indianapolis in Indiana to work for the Mallory Company. They were building at that time in Mallory batteries and components for electronic systems. They wanted to go into a new business which is called microelectronics dealing with minute elements of components like resisters, diodes and so on and they needed an engineer to organize that part. They selected me and I William Loew 33 joined them and worked out the discreet components and not only was I working on the design for it, but I also miniaturized electronic systems using those components for the micro elements that the industry was going in that direction. Everything had to be miniaturized. Of course in any attempt of miniaturization the transistors and microchips surfaced all of a sudden and the diodes, the chips themselves, although they were in minute form a tremendous progress was shown at that time that those chips will take hold in the electronic industry and would take off in a hurry. It was at that time that Mallory had to make a decision whether of not to go into micro electronics for the discreet components, investing a lot of money of abandon this completely in view of the fact that the chip companies especially IBM and other Intel and other companies are coming out with micro electronics that could easily compete with the discreet components. So, I had to make a decision at that time which way to go and again I was called -- I got a call from General Instrument, my old company, would I like to join them and that company then was not in Newark New Jersey, but they expanded and they had some other outlets in design engineering in Massachusetts, Chicapa. that is the place where they recruited me to work on new designs on television tuners and that is not only very high frequency William Loew 34 tuners but also the ultra high frequency tuners. That was a time when I wa pretty much comfortable that I could help them out and I joined them again. But prior to that, before I joined them, I met a lovely lady, Lois, and I met her and I married her in Brown County in ___________. She was at that time a working psychologist. She finished her degree and she has her masters in psychology and she wanted to continue in the psychology discipline. Q. What year was this? A. This was in 1962. We married -- a lovely lady -- glad to have met her. Q. And you have been married how long. A. We've been married since 1962 so -- it seems like we've been married so long but it's been a breeze. Q. Do you have any children? A. We had three children. The oldest is Jennifer. The middle one is Amy and the youngest is Karen. They all are married, happily married. Jennifer is married to a very nice young man, Daniel Mendleson. Jennifer is working for the Holocaust Museum in the information part of the Holocaust Museum. Denny is a consultant in health issues. Amy is a school teacher and she has her own degree also as a consulting person for the school system. She also has her master's degree. She's married to a very nice young man, Steve Litman, he's going to be a CPA. He's an William Loew 35 accountant now. They have two children, so I am a grandfather and I have two grandchildren. The youngest one is Karen married to a very nice young man Steve Boden and he's a teacher in auto mechanics, very resourceful and a fine young man. So, we have a wonderful family. Q. I'm curious about how you told your children and your grandchildren if you've talked to them about your experience about the Holocaust. A. No, I never mentioned anything to my grandchildren, well first of all the grandchildren are tiny. They youngest, Alex, is only over a year old so he's got a wonderful -- End of Tape 2 William Loew 36 Tape 3 Q. -- and a very happy young fellow. And Rachel, she's three years old so she wouldn't be able to understand that. But to my own children, I never talked to them about my experiences. Every so often only I'll just flash through some event that I recalled and I will tell them that, and they would be very much interested in that, but I would stop at that point. I just wouldn't elaborate on that. There's no reason for it, for me to go through and frankly I'm not that comfortable in disclosing everything that was through my life, my past life. There was no reason for that and they should know it -- well, they know it now. I made that information available to the Holocaust Museum and if they are interested in it, they could view it, they could read it and they know it now. Those events that I flashed through my lifetime, everything had its own point that they could actually combine it together, so they know it pretty much what I went through and they're curious and rightly so. If they ask questions about a specific event I could tell them, and I will tell them, and I told them, but I don't elaborate on that point. I'm not reluctant but I'm not enthusiastic. So, whatever they ask questions I do it. I'd rather live the present life rather than my past life. There's William Loew 37 no glory in that, in the past. The only time that you want is to know that things are not forgotten, but it mustn't be prolonged. There's no need for that. Q. You mentioned earlier about when you get tired at a certain point you remember that march from __________ on the way to Dachau. Are there other things in your life that trigger memories, music or smells or anything from the Holocaust experience? A. Yes, there are many unpleasant memories that would trigger me but I would never relay that to my family. Q. Not necessarily to my family but to yourself? A. Yes, there was the time when I recall when I was on the train from Auschwitz to apparently I finally wound up in Flosenberg and on my way -- again, two events that come to my mind is the one that we were actually in open carts on the train and it was a very freezing day. It was the winter time. It was in January, and when they were making stops at certain stations, I recall that they would pull out the dead bodies out of those cars and some of them and they were piling them up on the side of the tracks. Some of them were still alive and there was one that I recall that he would be shooting them and they're alive. Maybe this is a better way to die than to suffer in a pile of bodies. That was one of the events. Well, those stops were more frequent and those piles were also more frequent. William Loew 38 We went through also Czechoslovakia in open carts and as we were traveling through Czechoslovakia I recall in those open carts people were standing on the overpass and they were throwing bread into the open carts and I thought this was a nice gesture from the Czechoslovakian people, whatever they could offer us, and they did. This was a little happier event. Q. Do you ever have nightmares about your experience in the war? A. I used to. I used to and I don't have them any more. Every so often I would, but I did have a lot of nightmares. Q. What were they of? A. Well, they were horrible feelings. You would try to get away and you cannot get away. You run and you feel like you're being trapped and you cannot get away. It's a terrible feeling. Occasionally I would wake up and it was much better then. But those feelings, those nightmares, I don't have them anymore, at least I don't know, at least I don't dream that much. Q. You were on the run for quite a while when you left your village and before you ended up getting caught. How long did it take for you to feel as though you weren't running anymore after the war was over. Do you still feel like you're running? A. Well, the feeling of running was constant event with me. As long as you were in a strange country, as long as you were on false papers, say in Budapest which supposedly is a free country, William Loew 39 but I was on false papers. I arrived in Budapest for example in January and it wasn't occupied at that time by the Germans, but I think in February they occupied. So, until February I felt safe even though I was on Gentile papers. But in February when they occupied the country, again, we were in a dire situation that you had to start running again, and where do you go. There was very little you could do. You were in Hungary, you were closed in. I wasn't free because first of all I didn't know the language. So, you're always on the run. So, from Hungary my next bet was to run away from Hungary and the thought came to me many times to reach Turkey. That was the only free country you could possibly go, but to reach Turkey, you had to go to Rumania or some other country, or to go to Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia was a bad country because there was a war going on between the Yugoslavians and the Germans. So, it was a bad choice to go to Yugoslavia. The only way is to go to Rumania. And to go to Rumania you had to have connections. I didn't have the connections but since I joined the underground they had the connections. That's how I went to Rumania in the first place. Q. Yes, you had explained this in the video. I don't want to take up too much time asking you again, but I guess the question was more, even after the war, because of all the running you were doing, did you feel as though part of your life you were still running? William Loew 40 A. No, it wasn't that kind of feeling of running away from your life per se. The only time, the reason that I was moving from place to place here in the United States, it was on my own free will, and I was already an engineer with my degree and I could improve my status and to gain more experience, and this was the beauty of this country, that you could do so much with your own abilities without asking for any permission from anyone else. That's the beauty of it. There was no feeling that I'm running away, it was going to get some more experience and to see all the beauty of the United States. That is the nice part of it. Q. You mentioned earlier that I think before we started recording, that you thought your experience during the Holocaust -- I think you said this and maybe you explain it -- made you want to be more successful. Somehow made you more aggressive in your pursuit of your goal. Can you talk a little bit about how your experience affected the decisions you made and the goals that you set? A. Well, I felt that I met many survivors in my life time and every survivor that I met was to me at least a special person. I don't know that I could define a survivor but to me a survivor is a person who's got a will to live. He's a special person because he wants to live. But also, in order to live you have to live well. You have to acquire certain skills to do that. I have met yet a survivor that isn't doing that well. All of them that I William Loew 41 knew is fairly well. He's not a person who would be willing to go on welfare. I know of that. He's a person who either acquires some education or some profession or goes into some kind of business. He's a person who's got a drive. Maybe he acquired this during the days that he had to survive. I'm not saying this because of my own goals that I have set for myself, but I know a lot of survivors that they do have that kind of drive. They want to live well and they want to make up for the time that they have lost during the time when they were forced to lose the time. I know that from myself. I want to live well, but I work hard for that. It's good to work hard. You know, my family was in a honey business in Poland. We used to have a brewery, a honey brewery and we used to make honey wine. In fact the business that my parents used to have, it wasn't only my parents but all my uncles were in this kind of business because it came back for generations that we had established back in 1870s those breweries. So, the business was since 1870 that generation after generation was going on and everyone was in this kind of business. That was kind of inspiring to me. Although during the time that I was in my engineering profession, it was kind of questionable why am I in this kind of business in engineering rather than in the wine business. When I realized that to be in a wine business it would take a tremendous effort on my part to get acquainted with that part of the business, first of all I William Loew 42 wasn't prepared for it and second of all it was just a flashing thought on my part, to think about it. But I discarded that, being in that kind of business because first of all I was still pretty much involved in my engineering profession and at that time when that flashing thought came about I was in the ___________ administration working on extradition problems that we here had with the television products. Television products at that time and for a number of years emitted some x-rays out of the ________ tubes and that was the time when in 1975 when I gained that position with the Food and Drug Administration to regulate the industry so that the manufactures of the television product would comply with our regulations. I did work for FDA a number of years since 1975 all the way through 1990 when I retired and in those times I worked not only for regulating the television product but also working on medical devices working with the manufacturers making sure that they complied again to their own standards and their own specifications on certain products that was offered to the market. It was during that time that flashing point of going into the kind of business that became more a reality to me because I already started to make wine at home even before that time for our own consumption. Mostly honey wine. The honey wine that I recall, that certain taste that still haunts me over the years and to duplicate that wine from my parents and from the family William Loew 43 just in general since they'd been marketed back in Poland. Apparently we used to export it to different countries, it was a special taste. A taste I'll never forget, although I try so many times to duplicate it, I just cannot duplicate that. There were certain ingredients in that recipe that was never given to me, for obvious reasons I never inquired for that. I was too small, too young to realize how important that is. It is now that I remember that I feel that it was so important because it was a wonderful time. Ever since that time since I started to make wine I tried to duplicate that and I say maybe next year I'll try to find it. I never found it yet. But I wanted to start somewhere and I wanted to begin some experience in wine making in general. I bought a piece of land in Frederick County back in 1982 and my wife Lois and myself and my kids were planting year by year a new vintage, new vines and at this point in time since 1982 we have 5 1/2 acres of grapes that combines not only __________ grapes but French hybrid grapes, two distinctive varieties that you make different wines which have different palates but equally good, could be good if made right. All this time back in 1989 when I started to make some honey wine for the market, every year I would be producing a different wine hoping to find my recipe of the family and some disappointment in it because I cannot duplicate it and I still William Loew 44 experiment but any wine that I make, the honey wine that is, people like it and it's being sold on the market. I still hope that I will find that recipe. Q. I want to ask you when you first met your wife Lois -- she's American? A. She is. Q. When did you tell her your experience in the Holocaust and when you did what did you tell her? A. Well, Lois she knew that I'm from Europe. I told her so. Besides my accent she didn't ask a lot of questions about my past because she felt if I wanted to talk about my experiences I will and if I wouldn't want to talk obviously there was a reason I wouldn't want to talk. So, she wasn't pressing on that point. She's good about it. She only presses on certain questions if she misunderstood me, then I would try to explain it. Yes, I told her about some of my experiences. In fact, I make a point whenever a certain flashing event comes to my mind I would tell her right away, something flashed in my mind and I want to share this with you, and I would tell her that. At that point, if she's more inquisitive of that event, I would probably explain it or we would just end it at that point. As I mentioned before I don't live in the past so I'm not taken by that. I live by the present and I live for the future and I'm basically programmed to that. I don't have any guilt William Loew 45 feelings and if I do I just bury it. There's no reason to go on with that. Q. Guilt feelings? A. Guilt feelings that I'm the only one who survived and sometimes that is very difficult to justify. Sure, there is some guilt feelings. My brother Eli could have survived too if he would have been as lucky as I was. I tried to rescue him, went to ghetto, tried to get him out. I was too late. But it would be nice if someone of my family would have survived with me, but that's the fate. That's the way we keep on going. Q. Were there periods before you were married and after the war where it was lonely because you didn't have any family? A. Of course, that's obvious that you don't have any family you're on your own and that's something that any person who is by himself he tries to seek a new family. It's something that in order to continue with your life, continue with your tradition, it's something that you need to take some steps. I married a wonderful woman, who gave me wonderful children and grandchildren. We have a family and what I lost before I have regained and we have a future. The family is a wonderful family and they basically live in the tradition of my past family. Now, I want to touch base a little bit about the vineyard that I have established with my wife back in 1982 that I felt back in 1982 when I purchased that piece of land I wanted to make William Loew 46 sure that this is my place where I wanted to experiment in wine making in a place where I could retire. That was on my mind, that was goal, and that's what I started. After -- here we are in 1995. I retired back in 1990 and in that year we broke the ground and built a house here at the vineyard. It's a beautiful house, spacious, overlooking the vineyard. The point that I'm making is that whatever the goals you have set for yourself, things are achievable. You can do it if you're persistent. You can do it if you work hard. You can do it if you have support from your family, which I do, and my wife is wonderful in that area. Kids, my children are also supportive in many ways. They're proud of what we do, what we have, what a tradition is, what we anticipate to do. Anything in a project that we make they're very supportive. Q. How much -- it's a hard question I think to answer but how much of that persistence that you have, that optimism that you have do you think was there when you were born and how much did the experience during the Holocaust affect how you contribute to that desire to succeed and achieve goals? A. Frankly, I don't think that the Holocaust was the prime motivator to my goals. I'm a man who sets the goals and tries to achieve them. The only thing that would be a certain motivation to set my goals would be my upbringing, my family. Back in Europe where I was always proud of them, we were always hard William Loew 47 working people. Not that I knew at that time what a goal is, but I saw things around, being surrounded with the every day task that stood before us. My brother, the oldest brother Abe, he was a physiologist and he gained his master's degree in Warsaw. I recall that he wasn't prodded at all by my mother to gain his profession. He was willing to do it by himself. We had to support him because he was away from Lamberg, many miles away from us, so we had to support him. That is, my mother used to support him. My father died when I was four years old. So, he died, so I knew him very little, but he was the one who actually established the winery. So, were his brothers, my uncles, they all had wineries. Either they had wineries or they worked for one of our uncles. So, it was a family enterprise, as I mentioned before since 1870. As I said before I don't think the Holocaust did anything to my character. My character apparently was already established way back and the only thing that I had to do is to persist that I stay alive. Q. What influence do you think it ultimately had or that period in your life when you were between 15 and 20, how did it influence you? A. Well, sheer stubbornness that my life was all of a sudden interrupted and interrupted in a vicious way. Taken away from my being all the things that I loved. Now, you could imagine that a William Loew 48 young boy who is trying to remember all those good things from home all of a sudden doesn't have anything and I wasn't about to let go. I persisted that I do whatever I had to do what my parents would expect me to do. So, Holocaust was a crucial terrible time that what it did to my family and to me, but it couldn't break me, and wouldn't break me as long as I lived. Q. Do you think it made you more optimistic or less optimistic about life other than your optimism because you seemed optimistic, hopeful. A. Well, I was always hopeful with one exception of the time in Flosenberg where President Roosevelt died, so I -- the only thing that comes to my mind was a sheer stubbornness. I wasn't about to give up on things that were against my will. Very important part of your character because those people who were not stubborn enough gave up their life. And it doesn't take too much for anyone in those situations that I was in to give up their life. It was easy. It's to fight against terrible elements without having hope. It's easy to succumb to those pressures. I was stubborn. And it is a good situation and it was worth it every bit of it. Q. Now you were talking about how the Holocaust experience made you more stubborn. Do you think it made you more aggressive towards the pursuit of your goals? William Loew 49 A. I don't know about that. I feel that to claim that the Holocaust made me more stubborn in a certain way, I don't know. I feel that it's more a character of a person that becomes motivated in certain way. My motivation was to achieve certain goals in my life. You could probably project yourself, which direction you want to live, in what way. In my case, it was a matter of first getting an education after what I have lost and live the kind of life I would be comfortable with and second it seems to me that once you have achieved that goal, you cannot project yourself too much far ahead. You have to accept things as they come and make changes and be willing to make changes if it's necessary. In my case, I did make some changes in my life especially not continue to be in the engineering profession but something to pick up the roots of my family, namely wine making, and have fun. This is what we have it now and I feel very comfortable with it. As long as I can do it, I will do it. And if I cannot make it anymore I cannot do it because my age or my physical needs will require me to do something else, I don't know. I cannot project it at this point in time. Q. You had mentioned the problem with your feet because of the frost bite when you were being transported. Can you talk a little bit about that? A. Well it was a passing episode because the frost bite that I got on my feet it was unfortunate at that time because I had to William Loew 50 be strong enough to walk and I couldn't fake too well, by walking straight when I couldn't. I happen to have shoes at that time and the blisters that I got on my feet they wouldn't fit in my shoes and that was very painful. But ever since that time, everything got healed and there were no distortions on my toenails or anything else. It was just one of those things that it persisted. Since my evacuation from Auschwitz all the way through to Flosenberg, it seems to me it healed in Flosenberg so I was okay afterwards. When I left on that trip from Flosenberg I have not limped. It appears to me that I was okay at that time so evidently I got healed because I was strong enough to walk. Q. Do you have any problems now these days? A. No, no, I'm fine. Q. Physically? A. Physically I'm very strong. Physically I'm very healthy and I make sure that I maintain my body in a healthy way. Q. I wanted to ask you one other thing about what you said in a video interview that sometimes when you hear a knock you'll jump a little bit these days still. Can you talk about that? A. Yes, this is something that one of the remnants that I have from the Holocaust especially when I used to live in Budapest. I used to live different places in Budapest and especially at night the only thing that was dreadful after the German occupation that William Loew 51 some of my friends or acquaintances in Budapest were kind of disappearing one by one for no reason. Later on I found out that they were already imprisoned, some were. At that time ____________, which is a political prison where I actually wound up when they caught me on Rumanian border, that was the place where some of my friends were and I couldn't find them then, but living in different apartments in Budapest it was the night that was so dreadful because you heard this knocking at the door. And that's the time when any knock would scare me because that was the time I would think they came to pick me up. Ever since that time, that kind of persists and today someone knocks at the door I have a heartbeat much louder than I would want to have it. But we have now a doorbell. It sounds much softer. Q. One other thing that I picked up from your video interview was during the time that you were on the run, you had to trust a lot of people. You had to have faith in them that they wouldn't inform or turn you in or betray you. Do you think that had any effect on your outlook afterwards, that you were more trusting or less trusting? A. The trust that you are talking about is being so called free and that was everything took place in Budapest. This was the only place after I escaped from Poland the only place that I felt semi-free and being a free man walking on the streets without any armbands, identified as a Jew, because basically I was a Gentile William Loew 52 on the false papers, and the freedom was basically a superficial freedom. If you cannot identify yourself who you actually are, that's no freedom. You're basically a fugitive and if you're a fugitive you have to confine yourself to someone or not to confine yourself so living in those apartments in Hungary that I did, I always had to tell them who I am that I am a Polish refugee. In order to convince them that I am a good practicing catholic I would go to them to church. That was to convince them that I am in good standing with them, but I would never claim that I am Jewish. So, there was no trust in that other than I had to survive the way I had to survive. They don't have to know about those things. It was experience. I could talk to you now because I'm free, but there was no freedom at that time. I had to deny my own religion for something I hated to do that but life goes on and things have passed. I could talk about it now in a more leisurely way. Thank God for that. Q. I think I pretty much covered all the territory that I wanted. Is there anything you'd like to say that I haven't asked you about? A. I don't know what to add to my testimony more what I had. There were maybe some more incidents, more events that I haven't covered. Maybe there were some important things, I don't recall. The only thing I could recall is a flashing point that I could William Loew 53 recall that one event triggers another event and obviously I may have left many events because if you are talking about events since the Holocaust back in 1941 when they took away my brother Abe and all the way through my life and living among those 40 Jews in ________________, every day living with those people was an event by itself. Because these are horrible days, you live not from day to day but from minute to minute. Everything depends -- End of Tape 3 William Loew 54 Tape 4 A. -- determination by some assessment in ________________ because we could be picked up at that time almost any time. So, the life was horrible then. It would have been nice if some of the people would have been survived, I don't know. I don't know if any of them --. There are many events that I could probably recall, under proper circumstances I could probably disclose them, but I don't know it now. The life now is very good, wonderful. The family is wonderful. I'll leave it at that. Q. You don't seem to have any bitterness? A. No, no bitterness, maybe some sorrow, but this is the least I can endure. This is at least I could -- that doesn't have to make me angry because anger doesn't solve anything. I am emotional and it comes at times especially at the times when the flashbacks come in but they go away as soon as they come in. Q. How often do you have those flashbacks? A. Quite often. Q. Every day? A. No, I don't count them. I don't know when they come, they just come. Not necessarily every day. Something has to trigger that flashback it seems to me. William Loew 55 Q. Do you know what it is that triggers it? A. No, I don't know. It's part of a life cycle I suppose. Everyone has some recollections of their childhood and that's part of the process I suppose. Some are very happy events. Some of these flashbacks are very happy, some are very bad. I don't know which type of flashback I have. I never counted them. I never tried to separate them. They come quite naturally and they go away. Q. How long do they last normally? A. Just a flashback. Q. Just a moment? A. Yes. Just a flashback and the flashbacks actually could be interpreted later on. I could interpret what that flashback is. I could probably ask myself what happened. It could be a very happy event. And of course it could be a very sad event. Probably there are more happy events that surface to me than the bad events, which is good in a way because the happy events mostly tie in with the family. Q. What's a typical flashback? Do you have a recurring flashback from the Holocaust that you remember? A. No, I have just occasional flashbacks from the Holocaust. As I said there are more happy events than bad events. Maybe for very good obvious reasons, I don't know why. Maybe I want to remember those good events and they're happy or interesting and William Loew 56 you could stay with them a little bit longer. So, it's those flashbacks will remain with me, not that I plan on them but they come when they want to come. Q. And you're not sure of a particular thing that triggers them? A. Right. I don't know how they come in nothing seems to trigger that flashback. They come naturally. Apparently there's a file in my head that opens up when it wants to open and it closes when it wants to be closed. I'll have to ask my wife, who's a psychologist how that works. It must work that way somehow. It's something -- an intermittent event. Maybe that's the way it works, intermittently. Q. I want to thank you very much for talking to me. A. Thank you very much for interviewing me. I appreciate that. Conclusion of Interview
