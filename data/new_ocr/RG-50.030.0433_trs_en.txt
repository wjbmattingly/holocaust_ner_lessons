So we pay and then we, we went over and then we went to a town in the south of France on the Spanish border called __________, where we stayed ther e until the German invaded the, the free zone, when the Americans landed in North Africa. And... 5 Q: What was, what was, for you as a child at the time, a ll of this moving around, what was that like for you? I mean, how did that... A: The life was, was, I was___ _____________in the back of my mind that maybe I was not going to stay there a very long time, then we move ag ain. Of course when we were in free zone, it was better off because actually we we re French and the Vichy(ph) government was arresting the foreigners to, to, they give them to the Germans, which I learned after the wa r. And in Lucien(ph), I had some teachers who tried to te ach __________ mostly socialist people, socialist member or, but there were also antiSemitism, you know, whatever the kids heard at home, bringing back to school and saying stories about Jews and so forth. For awhile we live in a hotel and af ter that we rented a place. I had my Bar Mitzvah there and I was in troduced to Jewish hi story by a woman named Mila(ph) Raseen(ph) who became a very well known Jewish re sistance member. She died under torture in __________ an d __________, passin g children to Switzerland she was caught. Mila(ph) Raseen(ph). And... Q: Do you remember feeling a lo t of fear and anger or, how woul d you describe and what did you talk about with your famil y, about what wa s happening? A: Well, during that year, until th e German came in the fr ee zone, I wouldn't say we felt completely safe, but the Germans were not th ere, so we, we thought, ______ ____ we could survive the war there. But the Vichy(ph) government was anti-Sem itic because you know they , they put, in effect, regulation that the German did ask them for. We try, for awhile we wanted to go to Spain. Since we were __________ we h eard that the Spanish, the Jews from Spanish origin, if they cross over to Spain they would not be taken back to the French, but we didn't pursue that because there were too many children, we had to go over the mountains, so we didn't. Q: How many were you altogether in your family at this time? A: Well, that time ther e when we left, when we left________________th ere, when the German arrived, we were, we were nine children, yeah, nine children. Q: And your mother? A: Each of, each of my uncles my uncles had, let's see, two, eight children, eight children, yeah. 6 Q: So eight children and then your mother and your tw o uncles and their wives? A: My mother, my two uncles and my and my a unt, yeah and my grandfather. My grandfather, yeah. Later on I'll give you, I'll give you an event that took place when the Gestapo arrested us and there was a deal. Part of the deal was that either myself or my grandfather would have to go with them. Where to be, go, go back with the Germans, to be shippe d to Dollsee(ph). But that was the choice that was given and from wh at I'm told, they thought that since I was younger than my grandfather, I had a better chan ce to survive and I've been a little upset by this during my life because I think it was unjust. But that's history, you can't tell. I came back alive, but he would not have come back alive. But I cam e back alive, deeply marked. If I would not have been deported, I would have been a different man. I think I've marked, I have be en marked much more because I went there very young. Some adults, maybe had thei r character formed alread y and it was not as, as strong effect on them as it was on me. Th en when the German came, in November 1942,________________week later, the whole zone alon g the Spanish border was declared a forbidden zone, especially for the Jews and we left. Q: So you left Lucien(ph) at that point? A: Yeah and we heard about the Italians protecti ng the Jews and so we went, we crossed France all over and we went to Nice. We went to Nice and there were the Italians and it was another atmosphere. We stayed in a ho tel there for awhile and then we move in _______ ____, which was also in Italian zone, up in the mountains. The northern Alps, northern Alps. Oh, it was also __________, so we found an hotel to stay at and we went in a house. Q: Let me ask you, this may seem a strange ques tion, but do you remember any happy times with your family during all of this travel, with all of these children and... A: Well, the happy times were th e time I was in Lucien and I ha d my Bar Mitzvah and I had that women Raseen(ph), Mila(ph) Raseen(ph) and teaching us Zionism and Jewish history and putting actually strength in our young minds . And I had friends, I had man y, I had many Jewish friends, because we were many Jews that were there, running away and Luci en was also a nice place, it was the mountain we went. We went on hikes, there was snow in the winter, we... But I remember an 7 event that never left me, it must have been the su mmer 1942 when we went out of sports, playing soccer and when we finished a nd it was outside town a little bit, was a, a __________, a few guys, a few children that wanted to see ho w I was circumcised, had heard that in church or whatever it is. And________________and they wanted to see, how does it look to have your male part circumcised and they took me by the arm, ___ _______ on the ground and so forth, took off my pants. And this I will never forget and never forgive them. It was pa rt of the anti-Semite atmosphere. I wouldn't say that everybody was an tagonistic toward the Jews, but many were and there was also the religious influen ce and the religious schools, Catholic schools and so forth, it was really a hotbed of anti-Semitism. On the other hand you have the, the secular school and the teachers, which other time, mostly came from the Socialism, Soci alist background. I wish they were more sympathetic to the Jews, but not as bad as people reared in the religion, religious, in the Catholic religion and so forth. A lot of people say that the French, you had the big round up in Paris on the 16th of July, where there was a change of mind ________________for. Well, maybe, but as far as I'm concerned, that, the change of sentiment didn't come from the, from the, that __________. It really switched around six months later, first when the German lost the battle of __________ and went into retreat in Africa and th en, couple months later, Stalingr ad, that was the turn and in many people's mind, there was this possibility that Germany will lose the war. So that's what I feel. Q: So tell me you're, you' re in the Italian zone. A: Yes. Q: At this point, in __________? A: First we arrive in Nice, we st ayed about a month in Nice and then we went to ____. I went back to school, in the school there. In __________ the atmosphere was different because the people over there hated the Italians very much , you know, despised the Italians. Actually, I'd become friendly with the Italian soldiers, I remember they used to have a picnic on the, on the grass in a little meadow when I was coming back fr om school and time they called me up and they were listening to the radio, English radio, BBC and they would give it to me and talk to me and friendly attitude. And we knew that________ ________the French to arrest anybod y and... But the atmosphere was 8 different that the people of Savo ire(ph) were more, I would call toda y rightist or, and they hated the Italians. So much that I'm sure that when the Ge rman came, they were glad that the German took over from the Italian. Q: What was, before we get to this, to the part when the Gestapo came... A: Yeah. Q: What was every day life lik e for you, where were you in school, in a public school? A: Yes, public school, of course, yes, yes. Q: And were there a lot, were there many restrictions imposed on you and your family? A: No, not restriction, no, no, not at that time. Of course in that zone we didn't have to wear the stars. We didn't have to wear the stars but our name was following us of course. And, and you know, we were coming in the middl e of the school year and you kn ow, all that was noticed and so forth. I don't have any good me mories there from my teachers or school. No, no I don't recall any people that left a print on my remembrance of this time in __________. No w, later on we knew that we were turned in by the, by the French people, Frenchmen. Q: So tell me what happened after ____. A: Well, after __________, that's where I was picked up and sent to Drancy and eventually to Auschwitz. Q: So tell me about what happened. A: Well it was one of my uncle, my uncles had decided that it was ti me to move out of Savoire(ph), because in Savoire(ph) you had a lot of, the resi stance was starting, there were attacks on Germans and the militia, the French militia. There was important resistance activity, it was starting. And a lot of German troops, als o, a lot of German troops and police and so forth. And one of them went to________________and __________, the center of France and he found a place where, it seemed to be quiet and so forth, so we were supposed to move there. So he came back to, he left his children over there with his wife an d he came back to fetch us to br ing to ____.

And then when the Gestapo came, he was with them. And it was the 23rd of December, 1943, just a couple of days befo re ____, Christmas, a holiday, a very important holiday for the Germans, you know. I im agine maybe they were lenient because it was ____ ______. They didn't want to take the children and have that party, you know, I guess they had the French girls in the, in the hotel with them, I mean that's where, they were stationed in th e hotel. Anyway, they took only four of us. Q: So who did they take? A: They take myself, my mother, my aunt and my two uncles. And... Q: I'm sorry, I'm confused, when yo u told, you said before that ther e was a deal that was made about your grandfather, that was a different time? A: Yeah. No, no, that was at that time. Q: I see. So it could have been your grandfather, bu t they decided you, I see. A: Yeah, yeah. The Germans probably told them, well we have to bring fi ve people, so you four and four others and either one of thes e two, you choose. Q: Who made the decision? A: Well actually it was, I think it was a decision between a member of the family, or... I'm told there wasn't, there was some discu ssion and so forth. The real truth is only, is only known to God. But after the war I remember that my moth er was upset about it. But that's it. Q: Did you know, did you have any idea where you were going? A: Yes. I'll tell you why, it's because in the fall of 1943, ______ ____, September, October. We were listening to the BBC every day. I remember clearly, as if it was yesterday, __________ report on the BBC describing exactly what __________ name of Auschwitz , describing what was going on, people arriving by the train, getting off the train, getting separated, getting the gas chamber and so forth. This, so in my mind, sticked with me and you know, I was not affected by, whatever I heard as a kid, I believe I took for, as the truth. And I carry that w ith me __________ . I talked to the people that were there alread y. So I had a good hun ch, a good feeling that what, what was going on.

And the adults, ____, okay, yeah we heard it too, but we didn't be lieve it. If we would have believed it, we would have acted in revolt, th ey didn't believe. But I belie ved. I believed it. So...

A: First we went to Chanberre(ph), we spent the night in __________. Next morning they put us on a truck, we went to Chanberre([h) and there, that was a real jail in Chanberre (ph), we were put in a cell and there they took everything from us, watches and everything.

I didn't see one German, only French gendarmes were around. And________________were already at us. Very sentimental, was a sentimental place for me because my grandfather, my grandmother on my fa ther's side lived there and they lived only a few blocks from the camp and so I kn ew Drancy. And I stayed three weeks there and then on the 20th January, 1944, five, six o'clock in the morning, everybody in the courtyard and a bus arriving and there was a German yelling, wh ich I found out later on, no I was told because everybody was talking about Bruner(ph), Bruner(ph) the commandant.

A: Well the gendarme actually were outside, right? Inside the camp, it was a Jewish, what you call a Jewish police, a Jewish, Jewish cadre(ph), sel ected by Bruner(ph), you kn ow, but when the buses came to pick us up, there was, th ere were the gendarmes. It was buses with a platform an outside platform on the back and there was a gendarme on each platform. And now through, I think, you know, later on, I think there were a possibility to escape, when the bus was taking us from Drancy to, to the railway station in________________to get load up on the train, but... Q: Why do you think that there was an opportunity... A: Well because there was only on e gendarme on the platform, the me n could have attacked and get ____, but of course you had to le ave the women and the children, but there could have been a mass escape. A lot of thing could have happen. Now they, there was, you know, the determined people, there were some determined peop le, for instance, in November, 194 3, or October 1943, two months before I arrived, some people tried to escape, th ey built a tunnel. And the tunnel was discovered only a couple of yards before it wa s finished. And so the Germans arrested these people and they 13 were shipped on a convoy and they escaped. They were determined and they escaped. They, they, they jumped through the window and they survived the war. There were a few escapes. I mean you have it in the Klassfeld(ph) book. So people that were determined, they, they had a better chance, but you have to leave th e women and the children be hind and the old people. That was a choice. That was a choice. Now when the, the bus took me to a railroad station in________________on the main street of Drancy and there was my, on the right side was a st reet where my grandfather, my grandmother lived.

Q: Do you, do you have any recollection of what you were thinking about during that train ride? Did you, did people talk to each other? A: Yeah, they talked. They talked, they were anxious, of course. In the back of my mind I still heard that report on the BBC was ti cking in my mind. Th at I recall. Because when you, when we arrive in Auschwitz and the door ope ned and so forth, we're done. That was it. So we arrived in the middle of the night in Auschwitz. Q: Had you eaten anything on the train? A: Oh yeah, we had that food and I remember I looked at, it wa s a window, an old window on the side and we took turn to go out the window, to look out, to get some fresh air and the first city I saw was Kaiserslaven(ph), just acro ss the French border. Then an other one __________ and then Glaivitz(ph). It just happened before being deported, I had studied the German geography in school, I knew the map of Germany, Glaivitz(ph) was the name and, that I recall, that's why I, I knew in what direction we were going, straight to Poland. And then we we re in Auschwitz and we stayed a few hours there, the tr ain waiting and then they opened the train and everybody out. Q: You waited for a few hours, just at the train station, inside the train car? A: While the train wa s stopped, you know? Q: Yes.

A lot of forest, lot, lot, ________________forest, barren forest and it was very different from the French forests. So mething, it was something new to me, something new to me. So we got off on the Auschwitz, separated the me n and women. We had to drop everything we had. Right away separate the men from th e women. My uncle was carrying the little girl and my mother had an argument with him, keep the girl back to her mother, which she did, otherwise she would have gone to the gas chamber with the kid. Then men and women separated, passi ng in that, in front of that SS officer and as we progressed in th e line, I heard H, H, they were, he was asking for H.

So we entered, there was a guy there, a prisoner, speaking French and translating, well, telling us what to do. Undress, ev erybody undressed, so forth. Once 17 we were naked, there was an inti midation beating of a prisoner. An SS was there and the two, two Poles came and they took somebo dy in the group and th ey, they beat him, you know __________, to show what it was, what we had to expect if we...

We were goi ng to be surrounded, we were going to be, they're going to have Russian paratroopers co me in over.
