While in January of 1939, a piece of Lithuania was given back to Germany, we went back, we went to the capital, Kaunus, or Kovno.

Uh, Lithuania was independent for awhile, and the war broke out on September the First of 1939 when Nazi Germany invaded Poland. Uh, I want to emphasize that while Poland had a powerful army, they did surrender in 19, 20 days. And this was naturally the beginning of the Holocaust because the German army while occupied Poland started without having a program what to do with the Jewish population, the Holocaust started in 1939 and kept on going through 1940 before concentration camps were established. Uh. SB: What did you hear when the war started? HK: Well, unfortunately, my sister, her husband, and their son Jerry were in Poland and we were cut off for a long time without getting any news from them. But since my sister was a Lithuanian citizen, I did manage to bring her from Poland, her and her son Jerry to Lithuania. Unfortunately, her husband was staying behind because he never got Lithuanian citizenship. Uh, she came, she came to Kaunus, her husband, like I said was left behind, and while he looked very much like a Christian having blond hair and blue eyes and very white complexion, somehow he was on the train going from Lodz to Warsaw, uh, I dont know, no difference how he was caught, and he was arrested and he ended up in Warsaw in the well known prison Paviachin (SP?) and he was shot over there.

In the meantime, in the Spring of 1940, the German army man- aged to occupy Belgium and Holland and France. And Stalin who was in charge of the Soviet Union, in order to prevent the Germans to occupy the Baltic countries, they marched in on June the 15th of 1941, excuse me 1940. They occupied the Baltic countries so Kovno, Lithuania, and Latvia, Estonia became part of the Soviet Union. Naturally to live under the Communist regime is far away from being pleasant, however, we thought maybe we are better off under the Communists than the Nazis because there was not such a thing as a mass killing.

We came home about 2 oclock AM, and then by the time I got home, it was about six in the morning and while the windows were open, I heard a noise, and I looked though the window and I saw some smoke far away which was ah, the airport in Kaunus. And in the beginning we were not suspicious of something was going on. I turned on immediately our radio, which was silent, it was about six in the morning, and then since I heard some more explosions, I turned into Berlin Radio, and sure enough the Prop., Joseph Goebbels, the Propaganda Minister, spok e in German and he said, While Im here on the radio, we are marching into Russia and in the name of God, we will be successful, we are going to destroy the system and the Jews, and then we knew that we are at war. We were living at that time on the outskirts of the city, uh, mostly Christian population, we didnt know exactly what was going on because by the time we got news from our local radio it was almost noon, and the rumors were that the Red army was already in East Prussia, what means in the German territories. However, I understood that the members of the Communist party were already packing and they were running to the railroad station. Monday, there were all kinds of rumors, but Tuesday afternoon, we saw, I saw on the outskirts the German motorcycles coming. Next day, which was a Wednesday, a car stopped in front of our house and there was some four German officers which asked us for permission to have breakfast in the gar- den.

However, I do recall that a soldier which came with them was standing right by, and he had a buckle like all the soldiers do have, you know, a belt with a buckle. And on the buckle it said, Gott mitt uns which means in English, God with us. And I figured out, knowing exactly what was going on in Germany because while going to school in France (coughs) I was always in Berlin at least one day while waiting for changing trains. And I figured out that if the slogan is God with us, God is with us, nothing will happen, and, to us. Unfortunately, the slaughter of the Jewish population did not start immediately, however the terror came from the Lithuanian population, and Im sorry to tell you that while being in the Lithuanian army, I never felt any hatred to the Jewish soldiers who were in my company. Um, I even played chess with my Lieutenant Mikalowskos and why the Lith- uanian populations, and I would say population because naturally you cant accuse the whole population. But why such a big percentage of Lithuanians started, especially in small towns and villages, the bloodshed against the Jews can not be understood, you know, by anybody because the Jewish, the Jews were living in Lithuania for 11 centuries, and they were just part of the country. Two weeks later, naturally, while the army was going deeper into Russia, the Gestapo came in and the first thing what did happen in the ghetto, going back to the ghetto.

And by August 15th of 1941, we were locked up in the suburb of the city, Vialompula or Slobodka, and we were behind the fence which was seven feet high, not a big problem how to escape be- cause this was not a wall like the Warsaw ghetto. This was on a Friday and next day there was already posters all over the ghetto saying in German and Lithuanian that the German authorities are demanding 500 men, graduated, college graduated and professional people to be at a certain place to be sent to the city hall to do some paperwork with the guarantee that they would come back that very same night. We were supposed to be there Monday morning, my brother was college graduate, gradu- ated, and so was me. And I do recall June the 18th of 1941, Monday morning, my mother, may she rest in peace, told both of us to go because theres nothing to it and they guaranteed that we would be back. I cannot explain why I didnt go, eh, my brother went. This was the first what we call the Intelligentsia Action, or Opera- tion Intellectuals. My brother never came back and while we were waiting for him at the gate from 6 oclock in the evening and the rest of the night, the rumors came that they would stay there overnight, they would maybe come tomorrow, and then since they were not coming tomorrow, uh, maybe they were sent out somewhere else. After the war was over, I found out that just a few hours later they were taken to a Fortification 7 and they were all shot over there. And this was the same problem in every ghetto because the Germans thought that maybe the people who graduated colleges Video Tape No.____ Camera Roll No. ____ Sound Roll No. ____ KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/HENRY KELLEN page 9 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W.

And then the next days, or maybe a week later, as you probably know, that in the ghetto, there was a big advantage to being in the ghetto than the concentration camps because first of all the fami- lies were together and we didnt have any Germans there at night and the way the ghetto was established we had what we called the Judenraute (SP?) which was, the head in our camp, you know, was Dr. Elkes a well know eye doctor. And there were just like a city hall because they had different departments. The most important department was the Labor Department which would sup- plied so many people every morning to go for different assignments. Then the Police Department, the Sanitation Department, and you mention, and after the Operation Intellectuals, 3 or 4 Germans came to the ghetto and we were ordered to deliver everything or value. Our rings, silver spoons, silver forks, whatever it was, radios, Filetilistic (?) stamps, and instruments. I do emphasize instruments because I will tell you later on what happened with the instruments. Ah, then the next episode I do recall was sending daily the 5,000 men and women to build the runways for the German airforce and theres nothing wrong building a highway or a runway, but it is absolutely beyond your comprehension what means to be constantly hunger without having proper clothes and being beaten up and cursed by the guards. We go back to a very important event which took place on October the 28th, 1941.

HK: My father was killed before we went to the ghetto. Like I mentioned, somehow, a Lithuanian which we will presume it was considered as maybe a fifth column because quite many Lithuanian young men had weapons on the very first day of the invasion of the German army. Somehow they got uniforms, the one who did not get uniforms put the handkerchief with the swastika on their armband and consequently collaborated with the Germans. And my father, who didnt expect atrocities, he went to town because his sister called him up that she didnt have any sugar and he never came back. So my father was the first one in all to be shot, and form all the documentation we have now, 3,000 Jewish men were at the Fortification number 4 for three days, eh, without food, without water, being tortured and beaten up and they were all killed on Fortification # 7. My father was, theres always a miracle because in many many cases one or two people somehow having some good connections were able to get out and so they told us the story. And also, all the events which did happen all over, not just in Lithuania or Latvia, Estonia, uh, photos were taken by German photographers, and they are here.

Uh, while we were building the airforce, the runways for the German airforce day and night, 5,000 people on one shift, 5,000 people on the night shift, we got back to the camp on October the 27th and then there were already loudspeakers and also posters all over the camp that Helmut Rauke, who was at that time in charge of the camp, was demanding the entire popula- tion of the camp to be at a certain place in order to be counted. The excuse was that he does not trust the Judenraute, ah, giving him the amount of inmates in order to know how much bread to give us, we must be counted. And regardless of age, children, old people, sick or well, they must be there. Anybody who would be on the premises would be shot. The doors must be open. And we were no na‰ve that we did believe what we were told. And I do recall that at 6 oclock on the morning October the 28th, we were at the empty lot, which was in the middle of the camp, and it was cold, October. In Europe its cold in the morning, and by about nine oclock I remember that Helmut Rauke with two more sergeants came and the selection started.

We were lined up with our families, I was standing with my mother, sister, and Jerry and my girlfriend. And, uh, we didnt know exactly at the beginning what was going on, but while we were getting closer and closer t Rauke, we saw people being divided. Some went left and some went right. While I was in line a friend of mine who was a Jewish policeman said, and I want you to know that in our police force which consisted out of 200 people, they were very very fine, intelligent men, not like in some other ghettos, and he says to me, Look, I dont know, I dont know, but he says to me, he doesnt know exactly what is happening, but, try to pull always back, dont try to go ahead. Pull back. And this is exactly what I did, and more or less by 4 oclock in the afternoon ah, all the people who went to the left were taken away. I never faced Rauke because, like I said, ah, eh, by now we do know that all the orders were coming from Berlin from the headquarters and on the 20th of October, 10,500 were sent to the left and next morning, the 29th, I was staying very close to the fence and I saw, unfortunately, groups of hundreds of people going up the hill, which was in the direction of the IXth Fort, and all day long we just heard machine guns noise and again, one boy, one boy, ten years old, he was already in the ditch, it seems to be he was not shot, and at night time he came back to the ghetto and he told us more details how the executions took place.

In other words, in other words, in order not to create a panic, they couldnt take 10,000 at one time. They were going there, but while a hundred were shot, another 100 were taken. And uh, next day we went back to the airport and I do remember that my particular guard, a German Alpha soldier who was from Sudentanland, which was a Czech, asked us how come we didnt come to work yesterday and when we told him and he said, Well, Im very sorry but I really dont believe it. But I think that it was, we made a mistake. Something did happen, by mistake they took away, but I dont believe that, you know, civilized people like we are doing the killing. So just imagine, he by himself didnt believe what was happening. Then theres no way to tell you what happened in 1942 and 43, all we knew, since we were completely isolated in the camp, without getting any news, because there was no such a thing like mail or telephone or newspapers, but in order to find out more or less what was going on, when we saw the guards were smiling, we knew things were very good for them. But then, at the end of 42, when the German got as far as Stalingrad and the Volga, as you probably know, this was the beginning of the defeat of the German army, at the same time the American and British airforce started to bomb German cities and I presume that the German guards were getting news that maybe their families, maybe their homes were getting de- stroyed, you saw the faces change a little bit.

HK: I didnt mention it. I didnt, but I can mention it. Well, its a very very sad episode because I was watching what was going on and I saw, ah, ah, 10,000 people is a lot of people, and we saw some older Lith- uanian women following the march, and we didnt know exactly why, but at about 5 oclock in the afternoon, some women were coming back from the fort, which was only about 1/2 a mile away, and they did carry with them baby carriages. And how sad it is that while the mother and the children were shot at the IXth Fort, and I presume the Germans gave away, you know, the baby carriages to Lithuanians, but this is a very sad epi- sode. By no mean, if somebody ask me how didnt you, did you, did you write while you were in the ghetto, a diary and I said, I didnt know because the situation was getting so hopeless that I knew none of us would survive because after the Big Action they were taking, when I say they, the Germans were taking almost weekly groups of a hundred, a hundred and fifty people to be deported and we really didnt know in what directions, either they were going to Latvia, Estonia or to Poland, but it came to a point where we knew that none of us would survive, and besides this, if somebody would like to write a diary, we didnt have a pencil or a pen, you Video Tape No.____ Camera Roll No. ____ Sound Roll No. ____ KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/HENRY KELLEN page 15 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W.

Food in the ghetto and trying to bring food in, can you tell me anything about that? Did you smuggle any food? HK: Uh, it came to a point that our biggest enemy were not the German guards. Hunger and cold became, you know, so severe that while working at the airport, we didnt have any chance to get food with exception at midnight were getting a little bit warm soup, which if somebody would have this soup in America, you would think this is not even good for a hungry dog or cat. Once in awhile maybe a rotten carrot or potato. Ah, now once the airport assignment came to an end, a smaller group was sent to different places, and there was the possibility whatever we still had left, and it didnt really, ah, didnt mean anything what it was. A pair of socks, underwear, a belt, or a suit, Lithuanians were coming to the places where we were working and giving, ah, exchanging in other words for a little food. And the food which we were getting was not easy to smuggle into the ghetto because they were always, the guards were searching us and we were very lucky when the guards were lenient, and we could bring something. And whatever I could bring in naturally I was sharing mainly with my nephew Jerry who was at that time six years old and he looked like a little skeleton anyway, and a little bit8 Video Tape No.____ Camera Roll No. ____ Sound Roll No. ____ KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/HENRY KELLEN page 16 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W.

Maybe, uh, the food wasnt as fancy as it is now in the United States, maybe it was better because people werent getting as sick as they are now, uh, and uh, complete freedom, I mean absolutely nothing to be expected what was happening and then, Im not a psy- chiatrist and not a philosopher, but you wouldnt believe what would happen to people affected by hunger.

Which is why we became, you know, like wile, wile, wild angry animals in the zoo and all we had in mind, is dreaming, is how to fill up our stomach. It is very hard to describe. However, once you dont eat for weeks, uh, your stomach is getting used to it, it shrinks to a certain extent, just a little piece of bread which were given, if you can call it bread, is enough, you know, to keep on going. To intellectual peoples older than I was, college profes- sors and school teachers, and lawyers who did, maybe, who did realize exactly what is happening, what is happening, knowing that the situation is hopeless, most these people were committing suicide in the very first beginning. And I was only 24 years old, and I had a big responsibility because I had to see to it that my mother, who was naturally twenty years older than I am, and my sister and my nephew should survive, and I thought, Well, if I were, uh, commit suicide, they would starve to death, so I did the best I could and I felt that instead to stay in the ghetto to work, you know, for the authorities, the Judenraute, if I will go out I have a better opportunity to bring us some food, you know. So, in order this way we can survive a little bit longer. But, eh, now I described many books that were written by people in the ghetto and how know more details what was happening which I didnt know and every day doing my homework I discover new things which I was absolutely ignorant about this.

Wilhelm Gerke was a short SS man who knew exactly that once the ghetto are being liqui- dated that the Germans in charge of the ghettoes were being sent to the front to fight the Russian army, and having good connections in Berlin he got a new assign- ment and changed the name from ghetto to concentration camp.

Im jumping to 1943, beginning of March and one day we got the message that Wilhelm Gerke wants to have a concert in the camp. Well, this we couldnt understand because we didnt have the music, we didnt have the musicians, and we didnt have any instruments. And sure enough, some violins were brought from the outside and there was maybe a few men who played music from before the war and one Sunday morning we were told, you know, that the inmates who do feel like coming to the concert are welcome and eh, my wife and myself went to listen and I even remember exactly what was played. Naturally you couldnt compare this with the symphony orchestra because there were only about ten or twelve guys play- ing. The photos were taken by the Germans and you can find those photos in Encyclopedia Holocaust (?) and in the museums. The, something was suspicious what was going on, because all of a sudden we are being consid- ered as a human being with a little bit better, with a little bit more food, and music. But what was happen- ing, we get (?) dormant again, we still had, out of about 30,000, still about 5,000 inmates, uh, and a week later, to be exact on March the 27th, 1944, we knew in the meantime that the Russians are getting closer to us.

And then we saw German SS and Gestapo with Ukrainian collaborators going from house to house.

What was happening, uh, we were looking through the window from this attic when my wife Julia, may she rest in peace, and myself. And this window was facing the very same lot, empty lot which the Big Action took place in 1941, October the 28th, and we saw a truck with high walls, without a roof, and through the day we saw something which, myself being today an old man who has more time to think about this, something which I do, cannot comprehend, while young German uniformed soldiers, if you can call them, with Ukrainians, were dragging mothers with children to the truck and, its really hard to describe what was going on because we saw mothers who wouldnt let the children loose and they were beaten so vicious, Dobermans were attacking the mothers and8 SB: We have to stop.

And this maybe what gives me the strength to continue talking about this because I feel if it happened once in a civilized country, it can happen anyplace.

I couldnt see far away my sister and her son next to the truck because like, some mothers let the children go right away. So what was happening in their little room, while Ukrainian soldiers came in, my sister was hiding Jerry under one of the pillows, there were two pillows. And she told me that while the soldiers came with open bayonet and did hit one of the pillows, it seems to be that the angel of death didnt want to take Jerry and he was hidden under the other pillow. He was, like I said, seven and a half years old, but he looked like a two years old baby because he was like a skeleton without having food for three years. And after 5 oclock when I saw everything get quiet and the trucks pulled out, I really dont know exactly how many chil- dren were taken away. Some people do presume that there were 600 or 700, but when I, after the Action was finished, immediately my wife and myself went to see what happen to Jerry and we saw a chalk, a circle, made on the door of the house which meant they were already there and nobody should bother them anymore. And, basically how Jerry by miracle survived. SB: Did you happen to witness the hospital burning early on? HK: I saw it from far away.

But I wasnt there, I only saw it from a distance, a half, 3/4, no, I would say half a mile or maybe a little bit less. SB: I didnt understand about the baby carriages and the IXth Fort. HK: While the 10,500 who were selected next day uh there were quite many mothers and children who were in this group. And they stayed overnight, in other words the ones who had been selected, they didnt come back to the ghetto, they went to the small ghetto, which was already empty. And then next morning, I wouldnt tell you exactly if it was 9 oclock or 10 oclock in the morning, but some mothers had the babies, you know, in carriages. Today in America, most of the babies are being uh, everyone, on our back, but those days, you know, women had carriages. And seems to me theres always a certain element which is hungry for every- thing, and I dont know if they knew that would get some trophies or not, but they were following the 10,000 people over there going up and ah, naturally once the people got in behind the gate of the fortifi- cation, I presume that the Germans took the people but didnt want the carriages. So the women who were fol- lowing the the the people who was shot got the car- riages and they were coming back with empty ones.

HK: Well, after the Kinder Action, first of all, Jerry was alive, but physically was not existing anymore because if he would be on the street, he would have been taken away immediately. Uh, until 1944, it looked like Germany was going to win the war. The very first beginning I said that it was not hard to escape because the fence was made out of barbed wires, however with a good scissors or with the pliers you could cut it and get out in spite of the fact there were guards outside. But it looked like first of all Germanys winning the war, and the local population were hostiles. So, lets say you would get out, where would you go? They will catch you immediately. Everybody knew who we were, not only because we had the star, which eventually we could take it off, but we looked like like criminals. I didnt have a warm water on my body to take a shower for three years, so just imagine the conditions. I forgot my name because nobody called me by name. They called me either, the guards did, Damn Jew, or, I didnt exist like a human anymore, I mean, so what would you escape. But, by 1944, we were getting already messages that the Russians are getting very very close, pushing the German army back. I got once a Lithuanian paper which on the front page were giving all the time news whats going on in the front, and uh, I have to admit the German High Command every single day in Video Tape No.____ Camera Roll No. ____ Sound Roll No. ____ KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/HENRY KELLEN page 25 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W.

And it said, in a nice way, that we were retreating according to the plan, according to the plan, from one town to another one, and we knew that they were getting closer to us. And we felt that the chances of surviving are getting better. And ah, just by lucky coincidence, lucky lucky coinci- dence, we found out that the very poor Lithuanian farmer which also were living in a very dilapidated house which we would call maybe a farm in the United States, but this poor man had three children and one horse and one cow and we got the message that if would be able to escape from the camp, he would be willing to hide us. He also said he could only have enough space for 2, and we were three. My mother and my sister Sonya were still alive, and uh, we got out, we got out. We tried at nighttime, we tried in the morning, but we got out, we got to his house, we slept the night. We found out since January he was hiding four more people, a doctor with his wife and two children. And we were in hiding with this Lithuanian farmer 90 days. Eh, it was not easy because first of all he was so poor that he didnt have anything to eat for themselves, but they were serving whatever they had. After we were there about a week or so, they took away the cows, so conse- quently the children were not getting any milk and there were three children including Jerry. And, eh, we were in and out because there were certain days when he said, Look, I have a feeling that tonight the police will come.

(Cut) BS: Sound roll 15, camera roll 29 SB: You were going to say something HK: The name of the farmer was Joseph Urbanoff, a very humble man. And I came to American in 46 thanks to President Truman who at that time did issue the 5,000 affidavits for Holocaust survivors, regardless of religion and nationality because the inmates were not only Jews. And naturally I came to the United States penniless, however, I didnt take my freedom for grant- ed because I could walk on the streets and nobody was spitting in my face and uh, I did appreciate it from the very first day until today the freedom of this wonderful country. And freedom is not a gift from heaven. By no means. We must fight for freedom every single day in order not to lose it. I, we were here about one year and we started to send packages to Urbanoff, letters, we never heard from him until today. However, Lithuania was occupied by the Soviets until about three years ago because the country is now inde- pendent again. The capital is not anymore Kovno, or Kaunus, it is Vilnius.

And we met, we had lunch and then he was with me at the museum and I really didnt want for him to feel bad, but I had to tell him something that he has to know. How his country misbehaved against us. At the same time I told him that Urbanoff saved my life, and I took him to a garden which is in our museum, the garden is dedicated to the righteous Gentiles. Ah, I dont think you have in Washington at your museum here a garden which is dedi- cated to the righteous. Theres one in Jerusalem at the Holocaust Museum, Yad Vashem (SP?), and we have plaques of Righteous from every country and among them Urban- off. And he was very proud about this and I asked him for a favor, I said, Look, by coincidence I have a picture, not of Urbanoff, but I do have a photo of his daughter, who was at that time twenty years old. Her name is Anna. And I said, Before you go back home, heres the picture since you do work for leading news- paper in Vilnius, have her photo printed and lets do our best to find her. Well, a few months later I got from him the newspaper with the write-up in Lithuanian revealing exactly our interview, her picture was print- ed, but this is already May, almost six months, so far I didnt hear from them or from her. Hopefully well find her because all the righteous, and I met few of them, and I talked to them and their older people, men and women, and I called them, You are a hero, because it was not easy, it was not easy to hide a Jewish family for different reasons.

A family that was hiding a Jew or one Jew in the family, the same thing on the eastern side of Europe. And anybody who was caught was executed together with us. Especial- ly in Eastern Europe. In the west they were sent to concentration camps. So, these people deserves a lot of gratitude and this gratitude can not just be expressed by saying thank you or, I was looking in dictionary how to say thank you to them, there isnt such a thing. Because they were really sacrificing their life, not only their life but their familys life. And these good people, as long as I will be alive, will never be forgotten because they were such a good good people. And, uh, what else can we do? There would be less survivors if it wouldnt be these righteous Christians. SB: Tell me what a molina was. HK: They, well, to my knowledge, a molina was a place of hiding. Uh, it, you know, you know people were digging holes under the, under the foundations of the house or attic or what ever it is, because while we were being deported, or, like I said before, when rumors were coming from Vilnius that children were being taken away, some people managed to dig under the house a hole and to hide the children and this is basically the term or molina.

Bradley Wentworth Films, Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd, Potomac, MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: before the Germans came. Can you tell me what you know about those? HK: (Coughs) Well, the pogroms basically I know the Jewish history and the persecution of Jewish people already started a thousand years ago, since the Jews are being accused, you know, of crucifying Jesus. But ah, if you would just take basically what was happening in 12th century, the Crusaders were persecuting Jews all over. Then came the Inquisition in 1490 in Spain. At that time while Jews had the choice to convert to Christianity, they were not persecuted. If you didnt want it, some were killed and some were allowed to get out from there. Ah, going to pogroms, basically we are talking about what was happening in Russia under the Czar, and every time, you know, there was some problems like, for instance in 1905, Russia lost the war against Japan, and here the charge was made, and naturally he would send the Cossacks to kill Jewish communities. But nothing can be compared to the Holocaust because we are dealing with highly sophisticated society. Germans were always considered on the European continent as the most ah civilized people. You know, it was hard to think that if this would happen some place behind the moun- tains in Greece or Albania or Africa, you would have a little excuse, but never in Germany. I had quite many German friends.

And they were basically good people. How the Nazis managed to suc- cessfully poison with hatred people, it would take maybe years and years from now to explain how it was done because it was not easy to take good people and transform them to Bestia Fera which means in Latin wild animal. Being able to kill people and especially to kill children. I had a chance after the war to take revenge, like the Turks after the genocide took place in 1915 in Turkey where a million people were killed, and I had a chance maybe to kill some German Nazis. I couldnt do it for two reasons. First of all, Im not a killer. If I would have killed somebody, being now an old man, I would have sleepless nights, because how could I kill a human being? And then, I never had evidence that the Germans, right after the war, which was prisoners of war which I met, I never had evidence that they are the one who committed the crime against innocent people. So, consequently, Im glad that I never did it and I can go away from this planet with a clean conscience. SB: Were just about to run out, but I want to ask about the liquidation.

HK: I escaped 90 days before the final liquidation, ah, I was liberated by the Russian army July 31 on a Monday. Ah, we could hardly talk with each other be- cause while in hiding we were in a little old warehouse under the hay, eight people. And we were told by some Russian officers to stay where we are because it hap- pens quite often that the Russians have to retreat because all of a sudden the Germans are pushing them back, so we were still staying at the farm for the next five days and then a few days later we decided to go back to see what happened to the ghetto. When we got there, the gate was swung open, there was no housing. We entered the ghetto and we saw foundations without housing because you must know, there was no fancy apartment or skyscrapers, just little old housing which most of the times when we got in their three years ago didnt have electricity and hot water, and some times not even floors. And what we saw, and unfortunately I didnt have a camer a, and I dont know if anybody took pictures, but some people did not believe that at the last minute they were going to be evacuated, and they were hiding in the basements of the housing and the Einsatzgruppen, before the German army pulled out, the Einsatzgruppen, which was a special German unit who was Video Tape No.____ Camera Roll No. ____ Sound Roll No. ____ KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/HENRY KELLEN page 32 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W.

And I went to the house where my mother and my sister were left, while being in hiding we tried very very hard to get them out. My wife went from the hiding twice back to the neighborhood but she didnt go into the ghetto because otherwise she wouldnt be able to get out. But the very same people who helped us to get out she tried to get out my mother and sister. Unfortunately, she wasnt able to do it and then I found out that my mother and my sister were sent west and they ended up in Stuthoff. The men who were there were sent to Dachau. The tragic story of my life is that at least I do know that my father and my broth- er were shot and hopefully didnt have too long to suffer before they expired. But I found out from women who were in Stuthoff and we did who did witness under what under what circumstances my mother and my sister died and I think Im a very strong man mentally that I can still take it because I understand that they was suffering for weeks without food, without water being affected by typhus before they died. And I tell this my German general and I see him quite often now in El Paso, and hes speechless, he doesnt know what to tell me. Some women survived, some stronger women survived from Stuthoff. My sister and my mother did not. And I was still 13 months in Kovno because the war was still going on, the war was over, being an engineer I got a good position with the Russians.

And I say lucky because the borders were already closed and somehow a law came out that anyone who was born in Poland can go to Poland, and from Poland I smuggled myself to Germany and a lucky Henry Kellen ended up in El Paso Texas and had good years in the second time being born in the United States and I appreciate this country because, like I said before, freedom has to be appreciate and not taken for granted because its a very very wonderful commodity.

Because we didnt have any instruments. SB: The Fort, how long did it take and what did you know about the fort?

Poland was divided between Austria, Germany, and Russia, and somehow, the Czar was always from his experience afraid of being attacked by the Germans, so all the borders were built, you know, with fortifications, with forts, which, in America youve got like a night time fort (?) which is an open space with barracks, they were like fortifica- tions so in case the Germans will attack, the Russian army will hide behind the walls of the fort, facing the windows to the west and while the Germans are attack- ing, they can shoot at them. You can see the same thing in England, in many many place going back in history many many thousands of years. But while Lithuania was independent, it, everything was open, it was just, you know, there were some holes in the wall underground and when the German came, they took advantage of it, and this was the place of exterminations. But, this is basically, when I talk about your IXth Fort or VIIth Fort. The whole city of Kaunus, which was only 40 miles from the German borders with lots of fortifications. This is the meaning of a European fort, not American. SB: Can you tell me about your father again. Was that a pogrom, basically, that killed your father. HK: No, this was not a pogrom..

Tell me about that and tell me about your father again. HK: The telephone system in Europe was just the same like in America. His sister was living in the city, and we were living in the suburb, divided by a river. And uh, when the Germans came, my mother, like any other housewife, has always some food in the kitchen. Uh, not fresh vegetables, which you couldnt preserve, and not butter because anything of perishable goods at that time was spoiling because we didnt have any such thing 50-60 years ago like Frigidaires or iceboxes. But, like I said, we had a call from his sister asking him if he can bring some sugar, which my mother presumably had some. And he just took the sugar and was crossing the bridge and he was stopped by two Lithuanian uniformed soldiers who were collaborating with the Germans, and they arrested him, and this was it and I never saw him again. And then I found out he was in the group of the three thousand Jewish people who were massacred on the 7th Fort, because they were taking advantage of all the forts. But they were suffering for three days, and two people who were let out, having some connections, they told us how it happened. Photos are available of this too.

There were two Lithuanian guards who brought us over there and while were there they told us to unload everything and have the pipes taken off of the open railroad cars and throw them on the ground. Some- how, because I always did my best to keep myself clean, uh, shaved, and by the way, believe it or not, the one razorblade I used for three years and somehow I managed to have it. Today a razorblade is good for maybe 3-4 shaves. He, the Lithuanian told me, first of all he asked who was in the Lithuanian army, what rank did I have, and he said, Youre going to be in charge of unloading the train. And they went away, they were someplace drinking the whole morning and when they came back, we did manage, uh, the pipes were like I told you, at least about two feet long and uh, long, I couldnt even describe. Just imagine at least about, uh, I really dont know. Long. Very long, just the length of the car. We did manage, being very weak, to take out the pipes which were on the top. But being on the bottom, only a crane could take them out. And when they came back at noon, and they saw that the train is not unloaded, he got to me and started to curse me and says, Well, uh, why didnt you do what I told you? and I said it was impossible. He did hit me with the rifle in the back of my head, this must be made out steel because I dont know how he didnt kill me. And then he was just in the distance, a little bit further than this gentleman here, and he pulled out a bullet.

In charge of this little hospital was a Dr. Kaplan who survived and you must understand that at that time my hair was covering naturally my wound. She didnt even have a razorblade or razor to shave off my hair. And, uh, she managed somehow to give me, I dont remember exactly how many stitches.

I survived without medication, without food, and if this wasnt bad enough, while constantly the number of inmates were getting smaller, they were always cutting the fences smaller, so consequently we wouldnt have a little bit more room for ourselves. And while I was not going to work because I couldnt even walk, the order came out that we had to get out of this particular house, because in the meantime maybe thousands, maybe 1,500 were deported. And I do remember that my wife, Julia, may she rest in peace, uh, looked for another quarters and, eh, somehow we found another place to stay and I survived.
