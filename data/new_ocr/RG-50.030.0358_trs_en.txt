Edna B. Ipson. My name in Europe was Ipp, but I came here to America, my sister said , ﬁIpp, it doesn™t soun d so good.ﬂ So she said to help me make it a little better, so I now have got the name Ipson. But in Europe was our name Ipp. And we have a bi g family in Europe, the Ipps. Q: Okay, one moment. I need y ou to tell me what city you were born in and what year you were born.

In 1935, my husband fini shed law, and he practiced law. It™s a whole lot to tell you everything the way it was. 2 Q: Please try.

He went to Belgium there, and then he got another [Aleo] from London, Englan d. And life was really very go od and sweet. No worry about food, no worry about clothes, no worry about anyt hing. You really trade and you made. Well, it wasn™t so for long. Q: Now, before you go further, I just want to learn a little bit more about your fa mily life, even before you got married -- how you we re brought up, what you did . . . A: Well, I finished high school - not the high school, I went as a saleslady in the store, selling some merchandise. And I was modellin g, I was weighing 105 p ounds, so I was modell ing some clothes, too, in the same store. And I made good money, I really did. And I could sell merchandise. I could sell everything that was in the store. I used to put on clothes and show them -- I used to sell the -- I was modelling, too. I didn™t have to do anything they thought might be _ ___________. I didn™t have to help to support the fami ly because my papa was making mo ney. He had, you know, a shoe store and a repair shop, from shoes. So he was making good money, and he support all the children, but he worked. It was a sweet life. And then we had a home -- two-story house. So the three apartment my papa used to rent, and then the big one, we had been there, all the children, it was enough room. It was enoug h ________, close.

[Dejeu] _________ would bear the big [Yeshiva], if you know what a [Yeshiva] is. And that was about --even at the ______, the [Yeshiva] was there. And we used to go, you know, shoot this or something, if you know about the other days. __________ looked like the [Yeshiva] bo ys used to dance and sing and so on. And then, my mother, may she rest in peace, she used to give the boys each a bath twic e a week. And they [could eat]. So it means br eakfast, lunch, and dinner. ANd that™s what my mother used to give. Sometimes, if the help was a [serbet]. So at meals, we were good of the help and ____________ some people. I didn™t say that we were millionaires. But they were rich, you know. If they were happy, about the _____. I remember when th e one thing that my pa pa start building the second floor, I used to go early in the morning -- and we didn™t have the water, like here, but they have a little place they used to ca rry out the buckets and get the wa ter from about a block away and bring home. But no matter what , they were _________, no matter what, they were before. Sometimes was maybe hard days, too. But it was a sweet life. Everybody determined. It was everybody together. No fights, no rise, no nothing. And then, I ha d a grandmother, too, with us. That life will never come back. It™s right, the time is mine, too, but I never can forget. It™s hard to describe, even in that language th at I know so good, it™s hard -- but I think it™s hard to bring out -- retelling the fear [of the mo re], the fear for the same thing. It is -- I just couldn™t describe, but I describe to you one thing about Friday night -- but it was for the Jewish people -- it™s [Labutte]. Because it™s Labutte -- everybody got a little house for their self. And Friday night, no matter, you reach a middle place [poor people], that Holy [Bible] gave the people life to lead a whole week. Even the people who came to [ask], you know, help. You had pl enty poor people, but when it came Friday night, the candles was light up in the windows. The cakes they were cooking were smelling 4 all over. And no matter even -- you know, when the people didn™t have -- they used to [say, ﬁbeing in the house,ﬂ Hallit].. You know what the [Hal lit] is? That they should have for supper, [Hallit], because that was the main thing, you know. The life of -- the Jewish li fe, a little ________ -- no matter how many books you can write, it™s hard to describe how beautiful and how lovely it was. It™s so many things to describe about the life in Lithuania -- the holiness, the [Chabas]. My daddy used to go to _____, come back from ________. Everything was prepared. It is unbelievable to describe to you the happiness that you used to s ee daddies coming in. The table was set, the _______ was made, and everybody was sitting around the table and eating and enjoy it, the [Chabas]. The [CHabas] gave yo u so much for the whole week. To grow on. And you were brimming again about another Chabas . So that life, no matter what it is, and again, you [have to describe it], you don™t have , we don™t see. And we will never see it again. Never again. It™s just for my eye I could see . . . candles™ lights, this mirror, the way they were singing, the windows in the summertime was open. It is a life -- I don™t know. I even, I think yo u need it. I cannot describe the beauty, what it means Friday night at [Chabas]. Everybody used to go, dressed up, [Chabas after], you know, the _____, and they could walk and ta lking and ______ each othe r, and dressed up with the best clothes what they have . But with [Chabas], you used to have -- and it™s quite another feeling. It™s hard, but it was the beauty. The [Yeshivas], the schoo ls -- you had _________ schools, and everything was gone. Nothing was left over. Q: Now, was most -- most of your activity was in the Slovodka (ph) side. A: Yes. Q: Did you go over to Kovno? 5 A: Well, in Slovodka (ph) , then you see in Kovno. You see, in Kovno, I used to work there. Yet, everyday I used to work. And after, when I got married, I stopped work ing, and I had _________ my little boy, my Jay. Q: I™m trying to get a sense of -- you™re being very good at explaining to me what it felt like and what it looked like. What else you did -- were there a lot of cultural activities? A: I used to help a whole lot, you know, some people (ph). I di dn™t do too much culture, but you see, I used to help a whol e lot the Jewish poor people. For instance, if a girl , a poor girl, had a boy, after awhile forgot about it. A nd the girl didn™t have no home, no nothing, and she find a boy and I want to marry them off (ph), see now, what I did, I took another lady with me and I went, took my friends and I told them about the cake (ph), and I said, ﬁI need help. Th at girl didn™t have anything.ﬂ But you have to have a dowry, you have to have that and so on. A nd one thing I want to tell you -- that it happened to me -- two young girls. An d that™s what I helped them to get married. And they got married and they were leading a sweet life until, you know, th e war came. I used to help a whole lot people who need some money, you know, to borrow the money to help to get, to buy Singer™s (ph) machine. They didn™t have -- they have to have special. I used to help them. I used to give them. And then they used to pay me back. So each time, then, if they need some money, I was on the book. I used to help them with that. And then, I -- then what had happened, I couldn™t do anything in life, like culture or so on, because like I said, my husband was -- he finished law and then he started up with the motorcycles, and we ha ve to make a living, too. So I was occupied with the children -- I had another child, too. [Pause] So , I was in the business with my husband. And it was really a life beautiful. Then when the war broke out, I lost a little dear (ph). I had a little dear (ph) and I lost him. Well, honey, it™s a whole lot just to think that, it™s a whole lot to talk. I don™t 6 know, I™m jumping from one thing to the other, and I™m not going ex actly the way it should be. I don™t know. Q: Let me ask you a question, okay? Before the war, was there much anti-semitism? A: Anti-semitism? It started up abou t three years before the war. But it wasn™t so big. It was, but it wasn™t the way the war start. Q: So as a child, as a girl . . . A: You see, the problem, what it was in Lithuania, that the Ru ssians came in. And when the Russians came in, y ou see, then it started up a whole lot worse. A whole lot worse because, you see, the Jewish people -- most of the Prolat (ph) people used to g o, ﬁOh, oh.ﬂ Th e Russians, they go, ﬁBring us -- I don™t know -- th e breath from the sky.ﬂ But it wasn™t like that, it wasn™t. I™ll give you an example. I have an uncl e. He had a farm, a big farm. And he was _________, and among them was a whole lot farmers, _____ _____ farmers. He always used to help them. When they need because they™re in trouble, or they just need a horse, or they need -- they used to have a cow, because the little farmers, they was very poor there. And he used to help them because he was very big, had a very big farm. And the farmers knew my mother very well . Of course, she was raised in that farm, and then when she got married, you know, sh e came to Slovodka (ph). And when the farmer™s people, somebody used to get sick, they used to come to us, and the mother used to help them, to take them to the hospital. She used to cook for them, you know, some food, and take over there. So, with the farmers, wa s very, very good. And, as I reme mber, and then later on, I will come, maybe to th at point, the wa y we survived. Q: We™ll get to that. No w, was there much of a change of lifestyle when the Russians came in? A: Yeah, it changed a whole lot. It changed a whole lot. I tell you so mething -- my husband can tell you more than I can tell you -- it changed everythi ng, the whole life. It took the rich people who 7 had, you know, stores and they took him and send him to Siberia. And th at was before the war started up. So the rich people, some of them, they were lucky. They went to America, they went to another place. But here, I could see everything th e way it was. The midd le-class, _______ didn™t bother, but who was in charge in a place like factory people, or you know, the other people, you know, what they had stores, bakeri es and so on -- the people went on the first list. And they took him away and they send him to Siberia. I still couldn™t remember what had happened to the Lithuanian people. I still couldn™t think how people could change -- murders, chilling. When the war broke out, like I told you, th e ________ got here and the jail got here. And what had happened within that time, my husband, he took me and my son and my little girl, and we were running. Everybody start running to the RU ssians, ___________. We run an d they couldn™t reach, they couldn™t see, because the Ge rman came here already (ph). So wh at we have to do? No food, no nothing. We turn back ho me. They come in home. Some Lit huanian people told us, ﬁDon™t go this way, go this way.ﬂ It™s terrible. They took the Jewish people to the Ninth Fort (ph). They never came back. The children, parents, all the peop le. ____________, they t ook the children. They killed them all up there. Fortunately, we were luc ky. We took the left _______, not the right, and became a home. And when I saw my father -- he wa s dark complexion -- he was light, like that. In one night, they killed 200 people, over 200 people. It was _______________, then ________ Gatvia (ph). And we came back and they told us what had happened. They then took the neighbors. The blood on the walls -- some people wrote in Yiddish, ﬁPlease, name Nicoleﬂ -- I don™t know how to say it in Englis h. He wrote with the blood of the singer (ph), with big letters. A little boy from the fami ly, what they knew, he was under the bed. They didn™t see him. He had seen what goes on. So that little boy became a life that had to lay there. I just don™t know. It is so many things. So many things. It™s unbelievable. You wouldn ™t believe it, and nobody could 8 believe that people could be such murderers. Bu t murderers -- I judge the same people, the same people who we knew, they used to come to my house an d _____. They asked to help -- the same Lithuanian people, they slaughtered them. But from one _____, from one a ll the way to the end, they didn™t let _________. My pa pa was lucky. He locked window s, you know? And they got up on the _________, an d it was very quiet. So fortunately, they didn™t mu rder them. They thought nobody™s home. Well, I want to think. Well, then it happened, and the Germans came in. And they took over, you know. Slovodkians (ph), they took, you k now Kovno, all Lithuani an. They put us in the ghetto. Our house was on wa s on -- from the corner from our ho use, up _______ to the end. I ______ made the ghetto, alread y, that was in August the 15th, I think. Was locked up. You couldn™t take anything with you. They had to l eave everything that you had, except, you know, the clothes and something else. And we moved into my parents, in their house. And then my husband™s family, and his sister -- they all were there in the house where we were living. It wasn™t enough home[s] for so many people , I don™t know, 50,000 it was. So we had two ghettos. One was a little ghetto, and one was the big ghetto. We were in the big ghetto. My husband™s sister, her name was Doris, she was married, had a little boy. And she was in the little ghe tto. I™m going -- I forgot to tell you something. And getting back the way i told you we find out -- you know wh at they did? They took the rabbis. They got in there, they cut off his head and they para de with the rabbi™s head in the street. You see, when I am talking, that cannot conc entrate. You see, I have to run from one to the other. That was terrible. That was murderous --Yet I never thought that the Lithuanian people would do like that. A dog, a cat, got more pr ivacies that a Jew. Well, I™ll make short this. . . Q: No, don™t make short. If you can remember mo re incidences of the first two months, what you were doing before you moved to the ghetto , I think that would be very helpful. A: What we were doing? 9 Q: What you were doing. Did they start passing laws? Did you have to hide? Was there terror in the streets? A: Oh, that was in ghetto we have to hide ourselves. Q: Alright, but in the months , you know, between the Germans coming and the ghetto, there was maybe one month? or a mont h and a half? What . . . A: To getting in the ghetto? Q: Before you moved to the gh etto. What else happened? A: Oh, they didn™t do nothing, just tried to get ahead a farmer who used to deliver us milk (ph). And I prepared him -- I knew already that we have to go, you know, in the ghetto -- that he should help me to bring some potatoes, fl ours, maybe, you know, oil, or so mething else. And that left us for a couple of months to go on wi th the food. It wasn ™t easy because we didn™t have anything to eat. We couldn™t go out. In _______, you had to go to work, but even if yo u go to work, you cannot bring in anything. So I have to hide. I™ll tell yo u, when I went to work, I had to slice his bread like that, on my half a loaf. And I was looking which ___ ____ is the best one to go in in the ghetto. So, I start looking around here and here. And then he came here to me, the police did, you know? The German guard. ﬁWhat I have here?ﬂ I said, ﬁNothi ng. Perhaps it got here in your pocket. Ohﬂ I said, ﬁI got to just slice this bread. You know, you wouldn™t believe it, but please believe me.ﬂ He took away from me the bread because I have to help out (ph) Jay. He beat me up like an apple, an apple (ph). He beat me up, here in the back that for three weeks, I couldn™t sleep on my back. And the next day, I have to go to work. It wasn™t an easy life, but still, I was happy. And I had my family all together. No ma tter what he had, even then, they us ed to tell us, some days it™s a good day. You can take being in the ghetto. You know? They used to bring in the food, and then all of a sudden, they used to take away fro m you. And here, it™s no food, hung er. Then I used to go work. 10 I used to take some -- I tell you -- I used to go to work, I always, my feeling, I™ll go find my little boy. By being in ghetto, they bur ned down the hospital, with the ch ildren, with the doctors, with the nurse, across from the place where we used to live, and there™s a site. They used to take the children from the windows, the little babies, and threw them on the ground. Q: Did you see this? A: Not mine. Q: But you saw them -- di d you see the hospital burn? A: Oh yes, it was not -- it was across from my old pl ace. I was there. Not in the hospital. And they burned up the children. Q: Did you hear screaming and . . . A: I tell you something, that™s what they said. It™s hard for me because I™m coming back. [Pause] I don™t know where I was. Q: Well, I think you were trying to tell me about life in the ghetto. A: Yeah. Q: What kind of - you were working? A: I have to go to work. Q: What kind of work? A: What kind of work. Di gging trenches until I was up to here. If you didn™t finish, they would beat you up. They used to give you a special amount, so much and so much. You have to do it. That wasn™t _______. It was, I think, more people. You used to have good brigades, an d you used to have bad ones. A good brigade means that you would go out and you would shop, you know, to get a package. The bad ones used to be, like, big, ol d. And one day, I went to work. And we were standing, we were shoveling, you know, sand and mud. They were building a br idge. And we were 11 standing and we were talking. _______ said, ﬁOh, I wish I would have a _________ before _______.ﬂ I said, ﬁWell, I wish we could have Chabas (ph) to feast.ﬂ You know, we were talking.

And by talking like that, the German guard got in , and I was standing with the shovel and I didn™t work because we were talking. He hit me with his rifle over my head.

They got in in the ghetto -- that was August, I think, the 15th or the 20th, I couldn™t remember. In September, we had Rosh Hosanna. A day before that , they took out 20 -- 2,000 people to go to the ________, you know. And there was my father, my husband and my older brother.

Q: Let™s take a break right now, okay? We need to take a break. End of Tape 1. 16 Tape 2 Q: I wanted to know how you got chosen for a different work group. A: Oh, that. We used to get up in the morning, 4:00 in the morning. Had a cup of coffee. Had to make coffee, you know I -- You di dn™t have anything, no wood, no nothing, so y ou used to take a big nail, a heavy one, put it into th e electricity, and have a little -- so mething, you know, like a jar -- and you put it in in the jar, and the water was boiling and you didn ™t have coffee, but _______, we used to call it. It is just like something -- and we used to have in the morn ing, before we went, to have that, and a tiny little slice bread, and go to work. Sometimes we didn™t have the bread. So, at least to have warm inside. And I used to go out, I used to see the Bad (ph) Brigade, but you can™t get because there was a whole lot people, but I knew them. But fortunately, I used to be lucky. Fortunately, they used to pull me out from the Good brigade, and take me to the Bad brigade. What means a Good brigade? A Good brigade means you can work hard, it™s no different. What it is, you are young, you are healthy, a nd then you take something to run in, around the people there because ______ used to be, and sell them something -- like a sl eep, a place (ph), a something, whatever you had. And fo r that, you used to get some food. So at least -- or used to have some bread. Butter? We didn™t know what it means, butte r. No butter, no milk, no nothing. But at least, when you had the bread, you see, the coffee, like I explained to yo u, it™s okay, you can make it. Who knew what it me ans, meat? Nothing. You didn™t have nothing. But potatoes was very good, you know. A potato you can mix up with something else or you have to have. And you make something, add meal from that (ph). I reme mber one time, that they sa id you can bring in food. Well, the Good brigade -- when you used to have -- I used to take off my Star of David. I looked like a _______. And I was gone from one place, from one door to th e other. Until, you know, they used to give us something. Some people said, ﬁWe don™t have any, ﬂ but they just _______ potato 17 peels. I said, ﬁIt™s okay, too.ﬂ I used to take pot ato peels. Whatever we could get to bring home. Potato peels, they wouldn™t bothe r you so much -- unless (ph) they used to think that you have something else. Q: Now, what would happen if you got caught bringing this food back? A: Terrible, terrible. They used to send you in jail. That -- you were lucky. If they send you to jail. But some was good for me, you know, who was th e brigade commanders ( ph), you know, with the German guards. There was already good ones who let you go to do -- some of them wa s murderers. They didn™t. If they had caught you -- it didn™t hurt me so much the way they beat me up for the bread -- I didn™t kill the pain, but I killed the pain for the hunger, to be hungry. For not having, but for taking away the bread from me. You see what I mean? Yo u didn™t kill no pain. But pain was hunger, no food to eat. Starving. So when we used to go the brig ade, we used to have a Good brigade, so at least you used to get some clothes to change for food. So, when I used to come to the Christians there that knew me alre ady, so they used to give me something to eat, a slice bread, it was okay, with some water. Q: Now, did these Christians -- did they think you were just a poor farmer girl or what? A: Hmm-mm. The Christians? Q: Yeah. When you went to get something from them. A: Well, I used to come back -- they didn™t give you for free. But we were lucky that they gave us, for the clothes, what they had, because they figured, they said, th at the ghetto -- the models (ph) from the clothes. Because why? Clothes you coul d have. They didn™t take away. They took away from you the books, the pa intings, the grand things. But clothes, as much as you could, you could take it in. The furniture, everything, you have to gi ve. So you see? So when you used to have something to change, why not? They used to give you, you know? So they used to have a 18 _________, you see. It means that you used to have a good day with the food, but what you got, you are happy. I was ru nning, smiling, I have something. But the worst thing was if you came to the ghetto, to the brigade, you know. So, if you had a good brigade, then you go through. If you have Bad brigade, y ou™re in trouble. Q: And how did you know which one you were in? A: Well, that™s what ha ppened to me. I was lo oking for a good brigade. I knew where the good brigade was. And I was mo ving from one place to the other, and that™s what I got caught, and that™s what I got beat up. But it didn™t, like I said, it didn™t bother me, it didn™t hurt me, you know, the way I was beated up, but it hurt me why I lost the bread. It™s rich people, known people, in Lithuania, they didn™t have nothi ng to eat. My husband -- he™ll tell you tomorrow about it -- the way we used to help them -- from the same, what we had, you split in half -- half for us and half for them. And . . . I was young, I was strong, it was in the family. She lost a husband, she was with a _____, with her father and mother and I remember a young girl, a lady. She was married and her husband got killed. I think by the 550 people. Q: Oh, tell me about that, will you? A: Well -- Q: You forgot to tell me about that. A: Yeah. The 550 people. It wa s across from our hous e. And my husband wasn™t there, and I was running to look for him that he shouldn™t come home. And all -- a whole lot friends, educated people -- they asked just for the educated people because they had to find out and _________ -- I don™t know how to say in English, but that™s okay, you can fi nd out. So, everybod y, just for two days™ walk, or three days™ walk, so they was exactly across from ou r house. And there was about 550 young people. And they took all the people and killed them. Believe it. Five hundred and fifty 19 career ______. Friends of friends, lawyers, doctors . . . it was unbe lievable. People couldn™t believe that that could happen. And in two days, it was finished. Where th ey took him to the Ninth Fort. The Ninth Fort, my husband, the ______ asked him about it, ﬁPl ease do it.ﬂ He could tell you everything the way it happened. They had been killed -- I don™t know how many German people from Germany killed. So when you go, ask him. He could tell you more about it. Q: When did this action take place? A: That it happened when we got in and the ghetto, was August, the 20, I think. And that had happened before -- in a week, or two weeks later, wh en we got in in the ghett o. Then they took all the educated people, and they said they had to send them to the city order and to straighten out all the paperwork. ﬁPlease, and we need some help.ﬂ And that™s the way th ey took her husband. And they took them, and two days la ter, it was finished. We knew, somebody told us. Well. . . Q: Let me ask you a questio n. Back to the work. A: Again? Q: When you went to work, wh o watched over your children? A: My little girl -- I lost her before I got in the ghetto. My mother, she used to take care of my little boy. See, that™s why I could go to work, because I know he™s in good hands. But still, the fear -- because we used say in the other little cities, you know? -- they used to kill the children and take them away from the parents, and so on. So as l ong as I had my mother, my father, I was strong. But the fear inside I had . . . if I had come home, I hope I could find my little boy. Q: What happened to your daughter? A: To my little girl? She died. She died before I got in the ghetto. Q: She was sick? 20 A: Yes. She was only fo ur months old. And the way we were running and coming back, the way I told you before? And it was no help from doctors and so on and so she passed away. During in the ghetto, a lifetime, I used to run -- I used to get or ders from the farmers, from the Christian people, what they need. ﬁCan you bring me so-and-so? I™ ll have for you a nice package.ﬂ I used to run in the ghetto, look at somebody had something, what they ask. And I used to ask him, how much does he want? And he used to tell me the price, how much they want to have. I used to go there to the people, the Christian people, who or der, and I used to ge t, you know, a package or money, whatever it is. But the main thing it is that they want to have, you know -- fo od. So, it wasn™t too hard to run and to go and to sell it to the people and bring for the people who needs th e food. And now we had enough food for a couple days, probably, enough bread and so on. I stopped talking about the family, you know. But sh e had her parents, and she went hers elf. Her name was Bergma, Celia (ph). No food, no clothes, no -- even no water. So one day, they sa id that you can take in some wood, in the ghetto. You know what I did? I brought her -- you know, the wood -- and I gave to her and I told her (ph), go ahead, you go have hot water, you can have something to cook on. It was a risk to go out. It was really a risk. You thin k that the -- the Christian people, they used to say, ﬁPlease try to be careful. Try to be careful because you never k now what can happen to you.ﬂ But when hunger -- when you ™re hungry, you don™t ha ve nothing to heed. Nothing can stop you. I didn™t care. Let them shoot me. Let them kill me. As long I am alive, I™ll try to have something, the main thing was, you see, my Ja y. It wasn™t easy. But the hard est thing in the world was for me when I lost my people. Q: How did that happen? A: Well, nothing hard when I had my people -- my parent s, my brothers, my sister. And in ten minutes, I lost them, in ten minutes. They had to have some people for ______, for Estonia. I don™t 21 know how many people -- 500 or 600 people. I find out later, inst ead, they should go and get one person, they said, the singles (ph). It would take them a whole lot to get the people, so they took bigger families. So, what they di d, they took my family. Five people in ten minutes. Right before I tear them out of my arms , they was already gone. [C rying] I couldn™t do noth ing. I couldn™t do not a thing because the police and the German guards, and I didn™t thought that that could happen to them. It was about ten or eleven o™clock in the morning. Since then, I didn™t see them anymore. My last -- please forgive me, I™m so rry. But do you know what it mean s to lose your family in ten minutes? I never could forget. An d I shall never forget. At night, you cannot sleep, you™ve got the dreams. It™s awful. It™s awful, it™s painful. Q: When was this? A: Huh? Q: Do you remember when this ha ppened? When did this happen? A: In October of 1943. Between that time, there was a city with the name Shabut (ph), and there was a number of Jewish people. A nd the people of Shabut (ph), that was, at that time, from October until December. They took the child ren from the parents out there. And somebody came to tell us that the children from Sh abut (ph) had been taken away from the parents. Children, little ones, until up to 12 years. Twelve years, they can still go on at the work ______. So I said to my husband, what he should do, before I find out about the farmer , that my uncle is still alive. I got in contact with the farmer, Martinez (ph), that was his name. ANd, like I told you, my uncle used to help them a whole lot. So, they want to pa y back to him, to help him. He was out in 82 place s doing things. Eighty-two places. The only thing that it was to ge t in contact is somebody ha d to contact them that we should survive if it was with Jay, or maybe to send Jay alone. I finally got in contact with that Julius Schmitt (ph), with him that was his neighbor . And I used to send him some medicine, too. 22 And then I used to send for him, for the farmer, he wants a suit I used to bring him, a suit. I used to run away, like I told you. I used to make my wor k, my work is finished, then I used to take off my Star of David, and used to run. I used to go. There was a coal brig ade. There was, not too far from the coal brigade, a neighbor. And that man used to come to that neighbor. They knew each other. So when I got in over there, I used to find him. When I found him, first I have to finish my work. Four women has to finish to shovel the coal from the -- what you call it? -- train. So they used to have -- oy, like a choo choo train. So when I finish my work, and everything already finished, they didn™t bother you, as long you finished at the coal br igade (ph). Then I went with him and I got in contact with him. And I told hi m about the baby. And I said, ﬁPlease, immediately, try to get my uncle and tell him about the teddy ( ph). And please, he should help us to get out from the ghetto.ﬂ That™s the way I got in contact w ith my uncle. And I was in the brigade. And then, I had a nice, good package. He brought me some -- like, eggs, and he got a few pieces of butter, and bread, and flour. And when I got that , it was already late. Th e coal brigade was alread y gone. And I was left over by myself. Now, what should I do? Where should I ____? It™s no place. No place where to go and what to do. I was fortunately lucky. It was there go slow (ph), y ou know -- what you call it? It was a brigade, but they used to make -- go slow , all the ______, and they used to take up from the garden. Q: Cabbage? A: Right. So that brigade was the latest. And fortunately, I was lu cky that somebody told me you got one more brigade comi ng. And that brigade, when I said, ﬁSee me,ﬂ they grabbed me right away and they brought me in the ghetto. And I came to safety. It happened there at the coal brigade, was easy to make a Pekel (ph), they way th ey said, you know, a pack age. So it was a good day. Everybody from the women that finished. And some people us ed to know already that some 23 people got clothes or something, you know. They made some packag es -- good for us (ph).And all of a sudden, the guard from Gesta po came in to see what™s going on by the coal brigade. Had seen their packages. And he asked, ﬁWhose package is this one?ﬂ One girl got up and she said, ﬁIt™s mine.ﬂ She said, ﬁTake the packag e.ﬂ ______. Who she di d, nobody knows. I had seen what had happened to her, so I already run away. I didn™t look to him. And that arrogant Gestapo, what happened to her. I just don™t know. Because why? She had a package. That was wrong. That was wrong. The life in ghetto is worse than a dog in the street. F our o™clock in the morning, they used _______. They used to call up to get dressed and get out and take them in a special place, special field. Cold, bitter cold, to test what the people gonna do. Having my little boy, before you dressed him -- here you couldn™t see here in the clothes. I used to put up everything in his little bed that he used to be -- put up everything that in the morni ng, if it should rain, I should have right away for him, to dress him, and to be ou tside. How many people have there been -- in there room? No, less than that -- eight -- I think about eighteen or nineteen, maybe more . People there were sleeping on the floors. There was no beds, no sofas. But at least we had a pillow. And we had, you know, a _______, whatever. It™s - who can describe the horrible things in the ghettos. No ink can write, no writer can write up what we had to do during the thr ee years. But one thing that it was to me, as I told you, that was my people there. Q: Let me ask you two que stions, okay? You okay? A: Yes. Q: When you were living in the ghetto, did you still have Chabas (ph)? Did you still celebrate the holidays? A: The holidays? Q: Mm-hm. Could you practice your re ligion while you were in the ghetto? 24 A: Yeah, we used to have the holidays. But eac h holiday, when it used to come, the Gestapo gave you right away a holiday -- taking people, sending them to the Ninth Fort, to kill the people there, to take off their bodies from the . . . from the caves. We never ha d a holiday that we should enjoy. Because each holiday, when it used to come, always used to be bitter because they used -- they always gave you such a rough time. Used to take our peoples, they used to kill the people, they used to hang the people. Honey, I cannot tell you, just in the three hours, what they did. Before they went to the airport, they took 2,000 people -- and it was Rosh Ho sanna -- and some people didn™t want to go because it was the holidays. And what do you think they did? They killed them. They killed them to show them that you must go to work, it™s no holidays. So you asked me about holidays -- each holiday, no matter what, when used to come, always was bitter, full with tears, full of fear, full of pain. You cannot describe, even in Yiddish, which I know so good, I wouldn™t be able to describe it. But I went through, and so many people went th rough. But, I was fortunately lucky. I am alive. There have been other people -- no more. Q: Let me ask you a little more about the ghetto life. Were there -- other than your working, were there other activities going on in the ghetto? Were there -- was th at -- how did the children go to school? A: I think the children -- ac tivities there was, but for the children, they used to have school. That™s what they had, but they didn™t know . It was all secretly, you see? But they used to have for the children a school. And it was teachers, and that was, but they didn™t know. The Gestapo didn™t know. But we had activities -- I don™t remember, I don™t know. Because you see, I was a slave. I was a slave. I used to go out in the morning, come back, see ev erybody™s okay. Tired. Thinking what tomorrow will be. Will you have to get up early in the morning -- 4: 00. So, I don™t know too much about the activities, I™m honest with you. But I know that they have a school for the children. 25 And then, it wasn™t too many . It was already each time, each qua rter of the year, like three months, six months. Each time somethin g had happened and they had an excuse. Something had happened and they used to take out. That happ ened, that sort of thing happened. (ph) Q: Were there workshops inside the ghetto where people were -- A: Yeah, inside the ghetto was th e workshop, too. And some of them were going outside, and the -- but not everybody was lucky to get in there, you know? It wasn™t a whole lot people. I don™t know, I™ve never been there. B ecause like I said, I was b eating with myself, running he re and there. But it was -- they used to make for the shoulders, you know, like gloves and socks and all different things, you know, there. In Europe, used to be very co ld. And more things, you know, for the Gestapo. They used to come and want this suit, or a uniform to make and so on. TH ey used to tell them to make it. And that way we survived, because th e workmanship, the working people. And that the way I survived because I told them that I am no t a saleslady, not that, but I am a dressmaker. Q: Who was in charge of a ll of the workers? Was it the Gestapo? Was it the -- A: No, the Jewish people inside. The Gestapo was outside. The Gestapo had _____, like -- how do you say it -- the Gestapo didn™t come near to the gh etto, but they had their own building. And when it used to come to selection, th e first thing was the Gestapo. Q: The Gestapo ran the selection. A: The Gestapo used to come in the ghetto, oh yeah. They used to come into the ghetto. I remember one thing that had happen ed with a man. I couldn™t rememb er too close, but my Jay will remember -- the way they hang some two people or more. And they took out all the people who was inside, that they should come and see the way it happened. Q: Now, tell me a little bit about the administration in the ghetto. There was a unirat (ph)? A: The unirat (ph). 26 Q: Yeah. How was that ch osen? Did you know them? A: Oh, yeah. I know. I know that _______. We all partic ipated (ph). Tova [p h}? He studied with my husband, together. He was in the unirat (ph). And then was _______, Dr. Gerschon (ph). He was from Shabut (ph) an d he came here because he got married , for a girl, you know, who™s from Kovno. And then more people -- they was very active. An d they came in, you know, when it was the big selection, the 10,000 peopl e, like I told you. They asked, Gestapo asked -- Dr. Elkis (ph) was a famous doctor in ____. They want to have so many, so many peop le. And Dr. Elkis (ph) said, ﬁI will not give you, I will not select people. Go ahead and do by yourself. So when we got out, it was in October 28th, I think, in the big field. An d then you have to ha ve luck -- who™s alive and who™s dead. And then they to ok out close to 10,000 pe ople and they killed them, all of them. I think -- I don™t know -- one survived , but I know that all of them got killed because they didn™t let nobody stay at home, and everybody has to go out. And Dr. Elkis (ph) didn™t want to have on his conscience that here, that is your life, and that is your dead. And then th e unirat, you know, they used to have some trouble there. But they used to do something for them -- th ey gave them a year (ph), a present, or something, I do n™t know. The people trouble as they was in Gestapo, you know, but you go into the Gestapo, it is good-bye. You are not coming back to the ghetto, you are not coming back alive. So we used to help them. There was ______ __ -- I forgot, I tell you. It™s already 50 years away. And you cannot remember. And my memory is not anymore what it used to be before. Q: Were the people on the unirat (ph), were they good people? A: Huh? Q: The members of the unirat , were they good people? A: They were Lithuanian. 27 Q: The people who served on the unirat (ph), the members of the unirat(ph) . . . A: In the unirat (ph)? Q: Yeah. Were they good people? A: Oh, well, you know. It was a hard job, but it -- I don™t want to say anything else. They were rough. The police was rough. The Jewish police wa s very rough. It was hard. I want to tell you one more thing -- the way I got with my uncle . The day we run away from the ghetto -- Q: Okay, but let me just -- I want you to tell me about that, but I just want to sort of finish the ghetto part of my questions. There™s some things I™m really curious about. A: Well, listen, for somebody, they were good. For some body they were bad. You have to have vitamin tea, you know what it means? For _______. If you didn™t have ye llows, if you had yellow tea -- say, you have bad people and they are rough to . . . Q: When you went to jail, was that the Jewish jail? A: Huh? Q: When you said you had to go to the jail that time -- you were sent to the jail, remember? A: Yeah. Q:Was that a Jewish police in the jail? A: I don™t follow. Q: Okay, remember you told me that one time you were sent to the jail, to the prison. A: Oh, in prison. Q: Was that a Jewish police? A: Sure. Q: Ohh. 28 A: Jewish police. I beat him up, too. And they to ok me in jail, my sister-in-law and myself. And I was working every single day. Every single day I wa s working. Get up early in the morning -- rain, cold, snow. No matter what it is, you have to go. Q: Now, this unirat (ph) -- were they in char ge of the wo rking . . . A: The unirat was in charge for the Gestapo. You see, the unirat, they used to lead, like a government. And they used to get orders. They used to know when there came up a selection. They used to be the first ones to find out. And that™s what it was. And if something was wrong, they used to call the police. The police was rough, tough. Very ro ugh. Some of them were . . . Q: Do you think that so metimes they helped the people? Did they warn you about the actions? A: No. They never did. But I know -- well, the last action, what it was, a selection, the last one. Nobody knew. Because they were so good that they said, ﬁYou can take in food, as much as you can.ﬂ They allowed you to brin g in food. And by getting the fo od, I had a funny feeling, because each time, when they used to say, ﬁYou can bring food in the ghetto,ﬂ Not to be afraid, you know, but they come to help (ph). In the next two days or three days, a selection. And that™s what I remember -- that when I had food brought, heavie r than I was -- a pekel (ph), the way we used to say it -- and I said to myself, I hope everything will be okay. And in the next two days, it was selection. So there was, you know , like a government in ghetto. ANd in charge was Dr. Elkis (ph), a ________. Like I told you, and the few of them, what I know. Bu t nothing could help you. Just you have to find out for yourself what you can do. Q: Do you think that the life was different fo r a woman in the ghetto than it was for a man? A: I think it was mostly the same thing. The women ____ _____. And for the me n, they used to take him, you know, to hard labo r, different things to do. But for the women, the same thing, no different. No differ ence. I used to do all the hard work, all the hard work. That was my --like I said 29 -- my luck. When I used to have a good brigade, they used to pus h me out. You d on™t know what it used to be in the morning, on a big field, and to have the brigades, one goes to here, and one goes there. And all of a sudden, you got in in the good brigade, they pulled you out. And how many times I was beated up from the police. Q: The Jewish police. A: Yeah. Q: Was there -- for a woman, was it different because maybe in addition to doing the hard work, you also were more responsible for the children? A: They didn™t care for the childre n. You see, if they lost thei r husband, and she was by herself with a child, they didn™t bother her. But who™s with a fami ly, you have to go to work. Q: Were any women in the ghetto pregnant? A: Oh, yes, indeed. Q: And they were allowed to have their children? A: Many people got pregnant and they had to make abortion. And it had to be quiet. Nobody should know. Because if they go find something, you get killed. Like, they took away in 19-- when they got into the ghetto, that was I think in September. And a ll the frills, what you had -- all the gold and silver and diamonds -- should be turned in to the Gestapo. If one -- if they go find out that one didn™t turn in, ten families from the family where you are will be killed. And you know what my father did? My moth er, as they got, you know, some fears (ph), he to ok apart and he wound it up -- and they didn™t kill them. I had my purse I gave away, too, to that to the -- like I told you, to good Christians. But then they changed. They changed. They wasn™t the same anymore. If you went there to get the clothes, you know what they did? They killed you. They killed you after the 30 Liberation. And they told me I shouldn™t go and ask for th e clothes because you™ll get killed. I said, ﬁWell, Hitler didn™t kill me , to heck with them.ﬂ Q: Were you aware, in the ghetto, of any people who were sort of in an underground group of resistance? A: Oh, there was underg round people, too. Q: Did you know them? A: Some of them I already did, yo u know, like the partisan (ph). And the last one, whom I knew, he™s already dead. Q: But at the time, di d you know about them? A: At the time, I tell you, I knew that they exist -- a partisan group. But I wasn™t there. I wasn™t involved. My husband wasn™t involved. Because at that time, I had my people, and I had my family. You see, Jay, myself, and . . . but after Liberation, then was time to talk. YOu could talk. Because you were afra id of your own shad ow, that somebody sh ould know or not. Darling, I tell you something. It is so much, so much. I didn™t finish. I want to tell you an other thing. You finished with the ghetto? Q: Okay. A: I™ll go to my uncle. We go t Jay, my husband and myself. We got alrea dy that man who came to pick us up and to take us in ________ -- it was about 60 or 70 kilometers -- 100 kilometers from that place where my uncle was. Q: How did you get out of the ghetto? A: That™s what I want to tell you. So, and a month later, when I lost my people, they told us that they _______. They took the children away from the mothers. And we didn™t know when to save Jay™s life. I didn™t care for myself. And ______, he said, ﬁEdna, what happen to Jay will happen to 31 us. If Jay™s gone, all of us will go. Don™t look for some other places where to leave him.ﬂ So then he give me a push to go see my uncle again. And when they came already to that point, the way they were talking and everything was set up, we cut the wires -- ________ -- and Jay walked out first. And he went across the street there, and we told Jay, ﬁH ere and here,ﬂ and it was gone. Here and here in that place. We™ll be there in another half hour, maybe. Please don™t call, don™t scream, don™t say anything. Jay was waiting there for us -- there was another man who will pick us up. It took us about a half hour to go out on the wires. And you have to watch the guard. When the guard was away, and everything was quiet, we got through the wires, and we came to where Jay was. And that man,his name was Martinez (ph) . And he took us there where my uncle was. What I did, I took Martinez (ph) a jacket. You know, he scout (ph). I gave it to ______, to my husband, and his I gave to Martinez (ph) because he is a Prussian (ph) . And if he didn™t look like a Jewish person, and when we were driving, we took Jay in that wa gon. On top of that, we put up straw that you shouldn™t see that the child is there. And I had -- from a Chris tian, I had somebody years ago, a little jacket, you know, a little coat, and put on a scarf, and both of us looked like Prussian (ph) people, like farmers. And sure enough, we drove u p. It was about 30 mile s from Kovno. And they stopped us. My heart was beating. And I said, that is the end. And what had happened, he said, ﬁHave you got eggs for sale? Ha ve you got something else for sa le?ﬂ I said, ﬁNo.ﬂ That man, Martinez (ph), himself, he said, ﬁNo, we don™t have anything for sale.ﬂ ﬁO h, well, good-bye.ﬂ But that was a lucky moment. Finally, where should we go? So that fa rmer was very nice and he took us in to his house -- raining, cold, you know. We came in. He di dn™t took us right away to his house, but he took us to his brother-in-law™s house. And Jay was there under the straw, and all of a sudden, he starts saying, ﬁMama, Daddy -- Mama, Da ddy.ﬂ And the farmer, his brother-in-law said, ﬁWhat do I hear? I hear a voice.ﬂ ﬁOh,ﬂ he said, ﬁGo away. You don™t know what you™re talking 32 about.ﬂ Lucky number again. And we brought there, then we came to his house. We came to his house and was there for 39 days. The time was up. We find out that some people -- a lawyer from a ghetto -- it means my uncle™s ne phew is here hiding. He told us we have to go and not delay because we are in trouble. Gestapo, you know, the police, you know from over there -- the German police -- they was looking for the people. And there was, ac ross from them, somebody left a little boy or a girl, to hide them. They killed him. It™s so many things , I tell you. It happened so fast, where to start. And then, we came to his house. And by going back, to another farmer, he said, ﬁPlease, get in, all of us, in one place.ﬂ Like this . ANd we looked, a big st orm. And we heard not a fire from that place. The Germ ans was running to look around. And we were sitting there for an hour. Cold, bitter cold, just like that. That it shouldn™t look like we are Jewish people. That, see, that we are hiding. And they didn™t find us. That was another lucky number. Q: Let me stop here for a minute. A: It™s finished. It™s 4:00. Q: Okay. End of Tape 2. 33 Tape 3 Q: So you were in hiding for a long time, huh? A: For nine months. Q: Did you move around a lot or did you stay in one place the whole time? A: Oh, no. You have to move. Right now, I™m coming -- can I say? Q: Please. A: So then, he told us, he said, ﬁGet all together in one place, that it should look like a big rock.ﬂ He himself, I shall never forget, got down on the ground, and lay down and he said, ﬁThey are coming.ﬂ It means the German police -- I don™t k now who it was. After everything was over, he said to me, ﬁYou know, where should I take you?ﬂ I told him, ﬁYou know? Take me to Pashkovski (ph).ﬂ He said, ﬁOkay. I™ll take you there. But say anything to them that I brought you.ﬂ I said, ﬁOkay.ﬂ He brought us there and he was waiting until we go inside. We got in there and knocked on the door. The dogs was barking and barking and barking and barking and I didn™t know what it was. And I knocked on the door. He got back. He got scared when he™s up seeing me (ph). I said, ﬁDon™t get scared. Do you know Heika (ph)?ﬂ That™s the way they used to call her. ﬁYes.ﬂ I said, ﬁI™m Heika™s (p h) daughter.ﬂ ﬁHow did you come here?ﬂ I said, ﬁDon™t you know when I used to be a little girl, I used to come here and we got, you know, some fish, and we go fishing and so on?ﬂ ﬁOh, yeah. So what you hear? How did you come? How did you know?ﬂ I said, ﬁI know the place very good. I could come and I could go.ﬂ ﬁWho brought you here? What you got here ?ﬂ I said, ﬁWell, I have a pe rson who took me here, not to your place. But I knew exactly which way to go -- to the right, or to the left, or so on.ﬂ And I said, ﬁPlease let me in.ﬂ He looked at me and he said, ﬁOkay, go in. You are sure nobody brought you here?ﬂ I said, ﬁIf somebody would™ve brought me he re, I would have told you.ﬂ 34 BUt I told him to remind him, ﬁYou don™t reme mber me, but you remember my mother. Do you remember when -- Mrs. Preskovski (ph) -- when she worked there, in hospital, you know, my mother, the way I told you, my mother used to cook and come to be with them and give them some food and so on.ﬂ He said, ﬁYes, it™s true .ﬂ And I said, ﬁYou used to come to our house with the horses and buggy.ﬂ He said, ﬁYes. Ah-ha. So you are Heika™s (ph) daughter.ﬂ I said, ﬁYes. And that is my husband. And that is my so n.ﬂ I said, ﬁPlease let me in for a couple days until I get in contact with my uncle.ﬂ And my un cle told all the farmers where he is and where he is located -- not all of them, but a few of them., like that Martinez (ph). He knew everything. And he said, ﬁLet me tell you somethingﬂ -- All to the farmers . . . ﬁIf you want to get me out,ﬂ he said, ﬁlet me tell you one thing. Not one of you will be left alive. ﬂ Because it was not allowed to keep Jewish people. So he was in 82 places. Each time in another place, each time. The way people running from one place to the other. So, when it happened, that case. And he let us stay until -- I think six days or seven. And he starts looking around, why the dogs was barking. Why the dogs was barking. Something was wrong in their house. He said, ﬁI cannot keep you anymore.ﬂ I said, ﬁPut us in the pota toes bin,ﬂ you know, where the yeast is. Nothing doing. He got in contact with my uncle. And my uncle took us to another place. To _______. And by working over there, we were working -- I don™t know, a good while -- until we came to that farm. And poor farmer, very poor farmer, but very good people. Very good people. They share with us whatever they had. And my uncle used to come every week and to bring us some bread, milk for my -- for Jay. And so on, because they didn™t have anything. They didn™t have a cow. They got only one pig, or two, and two sheeps. When we came there, my uncle came. And he said, ﬁHere is that place. Try to be as long as you can.ﬂ And the farmers, already, was afraid, that in case somebody will give him out. So all the farmers will get killed. So they were 35 watching already. You see, they was watching -- they was watching him that nobody should give him out, in case or now they™re all in trouble. He came over there. And my uncle used to come there. But we have to have a hiding pl ace. Because we heard that, you see, the Germans are losing. And that, to make a hiding place to be was impossible. And what had happened, there was two potato pits. And my husband made out a grave, and he made a tunnel to go in from one to the other. And it was no air to breath e. He made just a little bitty hole, that even you couldn™t match up a light, a match to light up. We were there for nine months. The rest of my tale is the truth. Whatever had happened with my husband, he can tell you tomorrow. I fear not the Liberation. We didn™t have no clothes, no nothing. Darling . . . Q: How did you live in that hole for so long? A: How did -- it wasn™t only us. It my uncle. He had two children, his wife, his sister-in-law with a child. And other people came in, you know. We had maybe about 20 people hiding there. You couldn™t work, you couldn™t _______. We we re like dead people on the floor. You couldn™t stand. And at night, when it was already dark, when they used to go out and catch fresh air.

A: Yeah, my uncle used to bring some things, you know, food? Q: He would come and go? A: Oh, yes. He used to come at night, about 10:00, when it used to get dark. So he used to come at night. He used to be with us for three hours, four hours. And that poor fellow used to go back to his place. 36 Q: So the people hiding with you, there was different relatives. A: Yes. You see, that was the farmers, the way I told you, that my uncle used to live in peace with them. He used to help them a whole lot. And my grandmother, shall she rest in peace, she used to help them, too. And that what they liked. ___________, in Lithuanian. And that™s why they liked him, and that™s why they helped him to survive. It™s unbelievable. Q: What did you do all day? A: All day? Now I can tell you what I was doing . I didn™t know what to do.

And all of a sudden, she shout through the window, she got company. Oh, my goodness, that was horrible. Where should I go? I said, ﬁPut me somewhere.ﬂ She said, ﬁCome on.ﬂ She put me between, you know, the beets (ph). And I was hiding there, I was sitting there for four hours. I don™t know, there™s so many things to tell you about.

As long we had, you know, the corn put it up, you know, hay, we used to be on top. Then, it start coming up lower and lower and lower. And it was no place left to go. That was the last place, take it or leave it, like somebody said. And my husband said they were looking there a nd said, ﬁYou know, maybe the potato peaks (ph) 37 will be just right because one wasn™t far from th e other. And he built up a place that, like, he would be engineer. And we had children with us. Four children. It™s time to go, huh? Q: No. A: And we had four children, and the children, you see, he made a tunnel. We didn™t have nothing. No wood, no nothing had to support. I don™t know. The good Lord maybe saved our lives, by going from one ______ to the tunnel, a nd not having no support, whatsoever, fall down and you can, you know, get killed. So that saved our life. And we used to go out only at night. Q: So during the day . . . A: So during the day, they used to be there like I told you. You didn™t do nothing. Q: Now what would happen if the ki ds started crying or somebody got sick. A: Well, it was really a problem. It was really a problem. I remember, Jay took sick with his gums. It was terrible. But you wouldn™t believe it. So what you did, the lady, Proskovski (ph), she took onions and garlic and she used to rub him, you know. The teeth, it was swelled up, the gums and everything. And a little at a time, it star t healing up. I was sick that they wanted to take me back to the ghetto. The ghetto still was running. And I was sick and they want to try to take me to a doctor. The way I you, that I l ooked like a _______. I didn™t -- but I was afraid to go. So, with different kind of medicine, what they used to have. SO they used to make me some tea from a special flower. And I had some, I don™t know, aspirins or something. And I survived. I didn™t have to go back to the ghetto. Q: Did you have to teach the children to act in a certain way? To be quiet? To hide? A: Oh, the children knew it was quiet. And my uncle was teaching the children, you know, the whole Bible they knew by heart. They knew by heart the whole Bible. It was in the daytime, he was teaching them. And you know, you have to pray three times in the day? You know, 38 _________, __________, and in the morning service. And they learn everything they knew. They are right now in Israel. But it was tough. We didn™t know what it means to shower for nine months. So when we got the first show er, to go in a Turkish bath, it was unbelievable. Q: Did the farmer™s wife come and check on you all the time? A: Oh, yes. The farmer was with us because he was sitting there in the barn, and he was there and _______ used to help him to make the corn. And then he used to come in -- I forgot -- he used to come in at night and they had -- like, they make the flour by hand. I forgot what it is. So everybody was taking a little bit, and work and make some flour for bread, the corn. Q: I want to ask you a question because I™m a little confused about something. When you -- When your husband made that tunnel , this was in the peets (ph)? A: Yes, but you don™t know what -- Q: Is this different than the barns? Th is is a different place? The same place. A: I tell you what had happened. When my husband was making the tunnel, it was at night. Only at night you could do. He had a little lamp, you know, with a little, little, very little light. And people inside, in the house, we didn™t know. And all the friends were locked up, sleeping. They had a dog.

Finally, that boy, Jonas, come back. That dog run to him. And the dog was barking, and biting him. And he was running. Now my husband was. And wh en he came in, then he had seen him. If not him, he would be killed. And they helped h im to take away from the same. He got there a little mark. 39 Q: SO this was near the barn. A: Yes, you see. It was near to the barn, it was near to the house. It wasn™t too far away. Q: So sometimes in the daytime, you got out of the hole, and you went into the barn. A: In the daytime . . . Q: You went into the barn. A: No. Q: No? A: No, since that -- excuse me -- since that was ready, since we had the hiding place, because the Russians come back to Lithuania, you know -- they weren™t too far away. So, we have to have that hiding place. And that was in the daytime. We were sitting there, laying on the ground. And at night, we used to go out for two, three hours. Q: Do you know, were there partisans in this area? A: Do what? Q: Do you know if there were partisans in this area? A: Where there that they was? (ph) Q: Mm-hm. A: I don™t understand. Q: Okay. In this area, were there par tisan fighters? The resistance fighters? A: Oh, no. Q: No, not here. And were there a lot of Germans in the area? A: Well, no. There wasn™t, because there was, you s ee, just a farm. In the little farms, there was, you know, plenty of Germans. In each town, you had, you know, Germans, and then the Lithuanians. The murderers. 40 Q: How did you get water? A: Well, she used to take and bring us, in a big pot, some water and peas. And the peas were so hard that you hardly could bite. So she was bringing us the water and the peas and the _______. I don™t remember exactly the way it was. Bu t everybody was taking a swallow of water, and something. Everybody got a slice bread. And that™s it. And then, my uncle used to go out, and he used to bring something from the farmers. And my uncle was growing this _____, too. He used to take him out to help to bring the corn for the bread. He™ll tell you tomorrow. Q: Now, was it difficult to know who you could trust, who you could not trust? A: It is, sure, difficult. But you see, as long as I have my uncle, wasn™t difficult, because he knew the people. And he knew that he can trust the people. And he was beloved by the people. They liked him because he helped them. If he would be a bad farmer, that farm would be different. But he used to help everybody who needs some help. And then, they used to pay him out with different things, you see. So that™s the way. They liked him. Q: When you were hiding in this potato peet (ph) for all this time, do you remember what you thought about and what you dreamed about? A: IF I remember what? Q: What you were thinking or dreaming about at the time? A: What can I dream? You dream only to be alive and to get out and to be a free man. That is the main dream, what it was.

Said he™d get a farm and then you get to go on with your life. It was tough. Tough and hard. Q: How were you liberated? 41 A: Huh? Q: How did it happen that you were liberated? A: When we were liberated? Q: How did you know you were free? A: When they liberated, we got out. We were free people. And my husband went back to Slobodka (ph), to Kovno.

And they said, ﬁDon™t you say anything, that they are Jewish.ﬂ That was a Jewish officer in the army. He said, ﬁDon™t say nothing.ﬂ And we had to be quiet not to say anything. Because he said, ﬁHow did you survive? How you did it?ﬂ ______ -- I don™t know how to say, ﬁYou are 42 against the government,ﬂ or something. It was not an easy life, and that the Russians, too. It was terrible. Q: Okay, just a minute. Just a minute. When the Russian soldiers came through, when you met them, were you in hiding underground? A: We still, we had the hiding place. But somebody told us that it™s already free, they already -- the Russian people, the Russian soldiers came in already. And we walked out. And we came in.

What mend the pain? I will not say anymore. I hope I could -- I hoped always I was living this for . . . maybe I go see my people back. But I never did. And that was really again, perhaps you, too. Pray in full. You couldn™t run away from yourself. Everything you ev er had in your life. Hard labor didn™t bother me. Didn™t bother me. Hard labor -- I used to forget about my problems. But you never can forget. No matter how long you going to live. Never forget. Now, I can™t forget what had happened, but I told you, it™s just a little. Just a little, little.

I cannot talk to _______. It™s such bad memories. The crowd . . . I said, ﬁNot that, ________ﬂ Such bad memories. A crowd of people, you know ? Children™s hands, child ren™s feet, with the shoes on. Some bodies were bur ned up if you didn™t know whose shoes. Some of them were killed, shot. That™s what we find out in the ghetto. That -- could these hurt -- the pictures, right now informed us (ph). You wouldn™t believe it, but we had fear after the Liberation. It is unbelievable, unbelievable what they did. You see, some people had their bunker (ph) -- you know what the bunker(ph) is? Twenty people, 15 pe ople -- they were hiding. And some of them -- I don™t know how you tell them, how they get out -- that here is the bunkers. So what they did, some of them got out and they killed them. Some of them, they put up fire and they burned them up. It was horrible. It was bitter. It is -- you cannot describe -- you cannot describe the place, what we have seen and what they did to the Jewish people, to the Jewish _____.

Used to sell them, get some, beg some -- like I said, pigs or a cow or someth ing, and bring back, you know. In ______, my uncle used to help me. Q: Did the Christian people, when you came back, did they welcome you? A: Huh? Q: The Lithuanian people, when you returned . . . A: Yeah -- oh, they welcomed? Nah. 45 Q: How did they treat you? A: It was no place. I tell you something. It was no harmony anymore between the Lithuanian people and our people, because we know that they are murderers. Wherever they can find a Jew, they used to kill them to take to the Gestapo. I never could believe that years, years ago, when I used to come to my grandmother, to the farm and be with them, everything was open wide. Nobody did bother you. BUt since the Lithuanians start killing the people -- no matter whatever they found -- they killed them. They didn™ t save their life, but they killed them. Q: So how did you -- when you went back, did you -- A: I did, I came back where my husband was known, and he was a lawyer there. And then, he see -- he knew some people, some good people, you know. Letto (ph) was a new daddy, George (ph), he knew the other people. And how he said he raised a living, it was very hard, very, very hard. That™s what I told you. I was taking food and running there to the farmers and selling them different things, what they needed. Q: Was Jay in school? Did he go to school? A: Jay? No, that™s another point. Jay, I think, we nt to school just for a year, and then they run away. They have to run away because our li fe was very dangerous -- very, very dangerous because of the communists. My husband will tell you more. Q: You don™t want to tell me? A: He™ll tell you the same story a little bigger. Q: Okay, why was it so dangerous with the communists? A: What you said -- you said WHy? Q: Why so dangerous with the communists? 46 A: Why so dangerous? You don™t know the communist life. You don™t know. I couldn™t believe either. I couldn™t believe -- because it™s impossible.

Q: After the war, when you were in Kovno, and the Communists were in charge, could you be Jewish? Could you practi ce your religion? Could you observe the holidays? A: Oh, yes. That you could do it. They didn™t -- they wasn™t against you. But they were against -- they didn™t have any democracy the way we have here. There, everything that you used to do is under the government. Here, democracy means you can do what it please you. You can build what you want. You can build a business and make money. Pay the tax, the government wouldn™t bother you. And you gradually start gr owing and growing and growing, if you are not lazy. If you work, you make. You don™t work, you don™t make. Over there, it™s no democracy. You ask me right now about the Communism. I di dn™t want to say anything, but I™ll have to bring up and to tell you what had happened, why we have to run away. As you know, I was in business. I didn™t know that much (ph) about th e Communism. In our place, where we used to live, was a George (ph) from the marines (ph) . It was a captain over the eight ________.

And I found somebody who had a good knitting machine. And a machine that you don™t have to buy the merchandise, you know, but you can make your own wool, you know. Okay, they got that machine, and the man gave us some money. And my uncle was there, still on the farm. And what he gave me was a hog, you know, a cow, a life, and some money -- and some different, you know, food I couldn™t remember. I had potatoes and flour and so on. But as (ph) I™m coming back, the girls from concentration camp was alive. But they come back, they didn™t find no children, no husband, no nobody. So where they used to come? To the Ipps, you know -- in Lithuanian, Ipp-es. What I did, I didn™ t have too much at that time. So I had the potatoes, the potatoes and bread. And I had a big kettle. Put it up, peeled the potatoes with onion, pepper -- and it smells, it was so good -- and bread -- and I was feeding them with that.

I said, ﬁ________ (even though it was his name), I don™t know. I have been living in a democracy coun try, you can do whatever it please -- you can do whatever is good.ﬂ I said, ﬁWe will take it out right away and we go clean it up.ﬂ I think my husband wasn™t at that time at home. They send him, I think to Beluge (ph), in Lithuania. And I said, ﬁPlease, don™t mention it. Don™t bring any ha rm to us. Hitler didn™t kill us. Please.ﬂ And he used to come. I used to make the _______, di fferent things, the Russian food. But I could 48 tell, and he was burning.

You see my coat? What I was wearing is here with holes in my elbow s.ﬂ I said, ﬁI have to do something. This is not making anything. I even don™t have any coal to heat up the apartment.ﬂ I said, ﬁPlease understand. Right now, I see the regulations, ﬁ I said, ﬁfrom the Russian government. If you could teach me more, a little about that life, I promise you, I go follow exactly what you go say.ﬂ And I was crying. I was strong, but I start cryi ng because I was afraid for Jay. And now it™s easy to have respect, you know. But that particular _____ Siberian (ph) -- where would be my little Jay? And then I have more children who ha d lost their mothers. And I kept them in my place. I had about four. He said, ﬁOkay. I wi ll tell you what you can do.ﬂ I said, ﬁWhat can I do to make a living?ﬂ I said, ﬁCan I bake a nd sell, you know, some little cakes, you know.ﬂ He said, ﬁYes, you can do it.ﬂ We made a little kitchen -- a stove , a little stove.

And they have to see outside , on the ______, you know, that they have to do something to send him away in Siberia or to puni sh him, whatever he was doing. ANd that was already bitter. That was already bad. That was before, but I want to say something else. I couldn™t handle any more. I couldn™t produce an y more. The cookies was no life -- to stay and to cook all day, and then to sell it to make nothi ng. Finally, I sold the house that we had. And I ran back to the George (ph). And I had the -- I knew some people who want to sell the house, and they need some money to go in a __________. It™s a pity-case or something, you know. And I help them. But with the help, I shouldn™t do it. Because if they would caught me, they would send me to Siberia anyhow. My husband kne w that the George (ph). And he introduced me to him. When he introduced me to him, I became a lawyer. I start doing the papers, you know, to sell the papers. A thousand in one night. That™s the way I want to tell you. And I became -- I used to sell the house. I didn™t have no trouble. I had the secretary. She knew me already. I had the people who want to buy. And a happy people who wants the money to get out from Kovno to go into free world. So i made mone y. The truth. I made money, I didn™t have to work hard. But, each time I used to have something else to wear. I didn™t wear the same clothes. [Crying] Everything that I was doing was fear. Fear and painful. We made some money. I made it. And it came the moment where we have to leave everything that again I had. And on 50 our way, 12:00 at night. To make a long story short, I ran, not to the door, but I open up a window and jumped out of the window -- jumped out with Jay through the window. In the back yard, was there a ________ truck, you know? And he took us to vendors (ph). Between three and four months, it took us to get in Berlin. And from Berlin, we got in in the American zone (ph). Four months, I forgot my name. Jay sai d, ﬁI don™t know what™s my name.ﬂ That™s another thing -- cannot go on the same name each time. E ach time, wherever we went, it was no flowers. They took out my husband from the train. We didn™t _______ know about it. But they took my husband because he was wearing boots. And all of a sudden, they have seen that he got a watch. I thought it™s the end. But he said, ﬁLet me go. You want my boots? Here are the boots. In another place, you™ve got your watch. Let us go out.ﬂ We had been in Nobody™s Land for four or five days. Snow, bitter cold. Jay got sick. It is just unbelievable, unbelievable what people can go through -- maybe because I was younger. Well, to make a long story short, it was in Munich, and they had there, my husband had a job. Then I want to come to America to see my sister and my aunt that was my mother™s sister. I wrote them a letter that I want to come to America and I need your help. Didn™t took no time. And I told them I don™t want to be any more on the bloody earth. And we got the papers. I didn™t know what to do, which way to turn and which way to go. In Israel, you couldn™t go because it™s no place with no certificate. So, finally, when we came here, people were warm , people were nice. But I didn™t have the language. I didn™t know nothing. And my husband has to start out life from the beginning. Q: I™m gonna stop the tape here becaus e we have to put in another tape. End of Tape 3. 51 Tape 4 Q: I think I told you what it™s like in [Munich]. Life in [Munich] was when you had seen the people, what you thought they already did. And all of us hadn™t yet seen them. Survivors. It™s moment that I think, there I am. In seventh heav en? Or in another world? Or I™m dreaming. You can™t tell reality. It is to describe you moments like that -- the other people thought the same way. Oy, you thought that you are dead. You are alive. I said, Yes, I am here. It is things that you couldn™t believe. You couldn™t believe and you see some friends -- _________, that they are still come out from the ghettos, from th e concentration camps. You feel like one family. That™s the way you felt when you have met the peopl e from the concentration camps. We were looking at each other and saying, ﬁIs that the truth?ﬂ We are still alive. We couldn™t believe our own self anymore. And then we used to get together once in a while with some people, you know, whom we knew. They used to be in the -- what you call it -- in other places, just like this. It™s unbelievable. It™s really unbelievable. Tears from happiness that the people are alive. What you used to talking to people. What you used to do in Munich. In Munich, it was only one thing. How did you survive? How did you survive in places like that -- like in the concentration camps. No food, lice, no showers, no bread. And that was the main talk, about that. You couldn™t talk about something else, but each time, ﬁWhat happened to you? How did you survive?

But when the girls come back, you know, and we were on the train and in Kovno, they used to tell us everything. And I know what life was, and i know what my life was. So when we were in Munich, it™s no idle question. Just to go -- just to talk about the passing time from your life and now to look forward for your future. And we didn™t want to stay anymor e in Munich. It was enough. I couldn™t. Each day was for me horribl e. We used to hear Germans marching and back.

You had to see it (ph) to make a living. We were resting for a week. And he said, ﬁYou know, Edna, I wouldn™t go to college back. I wouldn™t study any more law.ﬂ I 55 said, ﬁWhy?ﬂ He said, ﬁAnd I love law.ﬂ He said he had to be born here.
