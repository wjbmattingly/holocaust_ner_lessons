You know, that was a long time before the Hitler anschlus (ph.). Q. What else can you tell me about your background in Vienna? A. My background in Vienna was a good, simple life with a nice family.

Right away afte r the wedding we left. My husband was a musician, a violinist, a very fine violinist, and we travelled a lot. As long as we were young, we travelled a lot. We went to Romani a, to Hungary, and to Poland. And then we settled. When my son was born in 1935, we settled in Warsaw.

Now, when you were in Warsaw, were you aware of what was starting to happen in Germany? A. No. No. No. We didn't -- maybe becau se we where young, and we didn't take life so very serious, you know. But rather I would say, rather it was a surprise for us. But it should come to us. All right. We heard a lo t of things, what's happened to the Jews in Germany, you know, but we really never t hought that was going to happen to us. Q. So you were aware that there were problems in Germany? A.

The saying was, "don't buy anything by Jews. Jews are you enemies." And there were signs on doors like barber shops. Jews -- not allowed. Things like this are very, very, very sad -- very sad.

And before the ghetto was closed completely, we run away from the ghetto -- from Warsaw, and we went to Krakow. Krakow -- only Krakow we couldn't stay eith er. We had to move 30 kilometers away from Krakow, in the country. And we were living there. And then the ghetto was built in Krakow. When the ghetto was built in Krakow, we had to move back from the country to the ghetto to Krakow. Q. What -- how did things come about that you had to move to the country? A. Because we didn't want to be closed in in the ghetto in Warsaw. We didn't want to stay in the ghetto -- do you know you had to stay in the ghetto even if you didn't want to. We know what some of the things that might happe n. We had to react to the sign of David. And we took this off, and we traveled in the train like -- not Jews. And that's the way we went to the country. Q. I'm confused about something. If you were in Krakow when the Germans came in -- A. Yes. Q. There was already a ghetto in Warsaw? A. No. There was filth, and it was a ghetto, bu t an open ghetto. There was a section of the city which was meant for the Jews to move in there, but it was ope n, you could still go out -- you know out.

A band leader, yes. Okay, a band leader. Q. In Warsaw? A. A band leader. Yes, his ba nd and he has a contract in Krakow. That's how we came from Warsaw to Krakow. And then when th e contract ended, and the Germans came in, and the contract was no good anymore. Jews di dn't play anymore. We went back to Warsaw. We had to move into the ghetto. Now, it's a new year, remember. But then when they said that the ghetto was going to be closed, we left. We left, and we went -- his parents were in Krakow, and his brothers and sister, so they want to be with the family. So we went there, and then we had to move away from Krakow. Q. Okay. I think I understand now . When -- can you describe to me what it was like when the Germans came? Do you remember that? A. Do I remember that? Of course I remember that.

Was it frightening? 5 A. Of course it was frightening. Of course. It was frightening, sure it was frightening. The Germans took away men from the streets, you know, just because they were Jews. And they put them already then in concentration camps. Q. Did they bomb Krakow at all? A. Yes, they bombed Krakow, but not to bad, not to bad. The first attack it was boom, boom. We went to the shelter. And this time I was living on Prove nska Olsa (ph.). We went to the shelter. My boy was in this time four years old, you know. So it was pretty -- we didn't have too much money. We were young and we didn't run away. A lot of people run away, you know. Not that we did any good with that, but we didn't run away. We didn't think that it was going to come to that, but it did come to it. You know, we didn't think that it was going to come to c oncentration camps and th ings like this. We didn't believe it. Q. What was the local reaction to the Germans coming in? A. The local reaction? Some of them, they like d it. Some of them, they didn't. The Poles by themselves -- some of them didn't like Je ws. Some of them, they were very good to Jews. Some of them helped saving their lives , and some of them helped destroying them. You know, like in ever country they have good people and bad people. Q.

Some of them like us and they help us to stay there. We stayed there until we had to move from there. We had to move from th ere and we had to go to the ghetto. In the meantime in Krakow we prepared a ghetto. The war was around the ghetto and we had we had to move to the ghetto. All Jews from the surrounding from Krakow had to move to the ghetto. So they liked us, and they had us stay there until we had to move from there. We had to move from there, and we had to go to the ghetto. In the meantime, in Krakow, they prepared a ghetto. They put a wall around the ghetto, and we had to move to the ghetto. All Jews from the surroundings from Krakow had to move to the ghetto. Q. And this was when? A. This was -- I would say '41 or '42, some thing like that. 1941 or '42, I don't remember exactly the dates. I don't want to give you the wrong dates. 7 Q.

We got from th e Jewish committee or organization, I don't know -- we got an apartment -- an apartment. We were living in a five-room apartment with ten families. We were living in one r oom with Henry's sister, brother-in-law, two children. They were four people, and we we re three is seven, and one sister-in-law, a single girl. Eight people, we were living, eating, sleeping -- living in this one room. And in each room of this apartment, this was the apartment of a doctor. Doctor in good times, but he had a dental -- a dental office there. In every room was just as many people. In the hallway was living a family. It was ver y, very congested, very crowded. We had a little iron stove in the middle of the room. And there we cooked. That was our life until they opened _________ -- in the beginning Abbe tslager (ph.). And then it became a concentration camp. Until we went there, that was about in 1943, '42, '43, something like that. Q. Were you working while living in the ghetto? A. No. Yes -- I was making money. We had fr iends and relatives, which -- men, which like to play cards. So in the evenings, we came up there up to my room, and five, six, seven men to play poker, or whatever they coul d play. And I cooked coffee, and I made sandwiches, and I baked cake, and I served them, and them and they paid me for it. This is how I mad a few dollars. My husband used to work there, too. There was a little cafe or restaurant were he used to play with this orchestra. It was a small orchestra, but it was an orchestra. The Germans permitted that. 8 Q. Was that in the ghetto, the cafe? A. In the ghetto, yes. Q. And was this just for the Jewish people? A. Just the Jewish people, yes. Q. And was it easy to get the food that you were cooking? Was there enough? A. No, it wasn't easy, but you could get it. In the back market -- you know people, the Polish people, they smuggled it in. There were some black markets, you know, you had to pay a lot of money for ever ything, but you could get it. You didn't have to starve when you had the money. Q.

What about the _________ _________? How did they manage? A. There were nice people be tween us and ugly people between us. There were a lot of people who took advantage of their position, you know.

Was there access to the Polish side, or did you have to stay in the ghetto? 9 A. There were access, but you had to have a permit to leave the ghetto. When you had to leave you at least had to have a reason to leave, so you had to apply for permission to leave. Sometimes you got it, sometimes you didn't. Q. For work or for what? A. Work. Work. Yes. Work -- there were gr oups of Jews which worked for Germans. My husband, for example, got a group which work for the Luftkow (ph.) Commando. It was some organization for fliers. I don't know what it is. And he had a group for cleaning the offices, and doing things like this. So he we nt out every day from the ghetto. In the morning, he went out, and he come back in the evening. Q. Were you always sure that he was going to come back? A. No. No. I wasn't sure he was going to co me back, and he wasn't sure that he was going to find me. But there were actions in the ghe tto in which they killed the people in the ghetto, and there were actions outside of the ghetto. You never know, you never know what the next hour is going to bring. Q. Can you describe for me those actions? A. I don't think so -- you want to listen to this. Q. I think it's important. Can you try? Just tell us what you remember. A. Just the actions. They put the old people all together in the ma rketplace, and they had buses there. Between these people was my husband's parents. They put them on the truck, and they pushed them out, a nd you never saw them again. ______________ in massive -- you never saw them. You never know where and when. They were horrible. They took the children out, children, little children, two years, three years, four years. They put them on the trucks and they move d them out. The parents came back in the evening from work, and they didn't find their children anymore. My nephew went this way. My sister-in-law, his sister went together with this baby. When she didn't want to let them go alone she went them. Her husba nd came home, and he didn't find his wife and his child anymore. I don't think anybody wants to listen to these things. 10 Q. This is important. This an important as a testimony for history. It is important that we know your pain. A. There was a hospital in the ghetto where they liquidated the hospital. They just killed the patients. The hospital -- they never came out of the hospital. I was lucky, I came out of this hospital. Some how, I don't know how it came, but I wi ll never forget. I was in the entrance. There was a mother with a child. I think she had just gave birth in the hospital to this child. And I went out there, and an SS man took this child by the legs, and he just hit him against a brick wall. He pushed us asid e, and then they went to the concentration camp. Q. How did you manage to keep your s on? I thought that was very hard. A. It was thanks to my husband.

He let us know when there was an action going on in the ghetto, and we had to send him out of the ghetto. He was out -- he was in different towns for some time there. A relative of ours was a police -- Jewish police that was high ranked, and he was there for a few weeks or months. I don't remember how long. And then the commandant said, "Bring him back, because there is going to be something there." 11 Barneya (ph.) was the name of the town. And that's -- there he met Schindler and commandant. That's where he met Schindler, and Schindler got a liking to him, and he put us on the list, and we we nt to Brelitzer (ph.). Q. Ok. So let's -- I'm not jumping ahead.

At the time that you were sent out of the ghetto, were you aware of camps -- concentration camps and things like that? Did you know about that? A. I heard about it! I heard about it!

Every day a certain amount. Every day a certa in amount went up there. It was, like, on a hill, you know. And we got accomodation in some barracks. And I was chosen because I spoke German. So I became a block______. Block______, it was like a like house mother you know. I had three-hundred women in my block, and I had to take care of -- that they should go out to work, and shouldn't run away, a nd they should be there. But it was a very tough job. Q. Why was it a tough job? A. Because the women wanted to do their own way, you know. They didn't want to listen.

I tried to. I tried to explain it to them , and somehow they listened to me, and somehow we -- in all this time, only one woman ra n away. One woman escaped, which I was punished for with twenty-five lashes on my behind, which was very painful, and very sicking for months. And -- but I was lucky because it was actually a life threat. Actually, they said, "When somebody runs aw ay from you, you are going to be killed." So I was lucky that I got away with this twenty-five. Q.

You know, sometimes when I -- when I think back like this, on an occasion like this, I hardly can believe that this has happened. So that's when I think, when I tell it to somebody else who never was there, how can they make any sens of the pictures, when I myself doubted that I could - I could live through this.

The Germans run away, a nd the next day in the morning there were 31 no Germans there. We were all on our own, and then we heard that the Russians were going to come, that the Russians were going to come, so they had to take Schindler away, because people were afraid that the Russians may not be so happy about him, so they got him out of the camp. Some drivers from us, so me of our prisoners -- we had a car -- took him in the car, took him to the Swiss border. And the Russians came, the Russian soldiers came. I will never forget them. They came on horses without saddles, without shoes.

So me and my sister-in-law, his sister, and my brother-in-law and his wife, and we all went on the way to -- there were no trains. I remember on the way we stole a horse and a platform, you know, like a wagon, and we went to the next town, where there was a little train going. We went on this train, and then we went to Czekloslovakia. The Czeks treated us very nicely. They took us to a school, and they fed us. They gave us food. They let us sleep there, and we came to Krakau. Somehow, it took us maybe a week, maybe ten days, but we made it. So then I was in Krakau, and I was together with a girlfriend, and I went to this apartment where I used to live when th e war broke out. And I spoke to the lady, and I said, I have no money, but I am a dressmaker by profession, so if you would let me have a room, I will try to make some money. I will pay you, and she did. She did. And I was 32 living there, and I was living already a little bit human life, my facilities. I was living with my girlfriend together, and we started to sew. We got some woman, and we sold dresses, blouses, shirts, whatever it was, and we made some money. And my husband, he didn't come. And one day my sister-in-law ca lled me downstairs, and she said, there is a newspaper, there came a newspaper from Munich. Regards to the families in Poland from the prisoners from Dachau. And between all the names, there were Henry Rosner and his ten-year-old son. So when I was reading that, I said, I am going to go to Munich. So my girlfriend says she is going with me.

Well, there was no trains going directly or something, some part s had the trains, some parts didn't have it yet. We had to walk.

My son was ten years old at this tim e. It was in 1945. He was born in 1935. He was ten years old. And he looked good, a little bit small for his age, but otherwise, he looked good. He was very skinny, and we were both sick on Typhus, and he was there in Munchen for 11 months. 11 months, the Americans took care of us. Q. In ___________? Were you in ____________? A.

Yes, he was playing -- in the Deutchesmuseum, there was a little cafe for the American officers, and he was playing there with a pianist and the orchestra. Not for money, he got food, you know, canned food, cigarettes, sugar, gasoline, whatever. Q. How come you decided to go to the United States? A. Because he had a brother here. My husband had a brother here. He came here in 1939 to the World's Fair, you know, in the Polish _________ as a pianist. And he couldn't go back, because there was no more communicatio n. All the ships were occupied by the Army, by the soldiers. He lost his wife and his daughter in Poland, and he stayed here. So then we knew that he was in America, but, of course, they didn't ha ve an address. We had no way to reach him, so Henry met in Dachau -- a major from the American army. He was an amateur cellist, and his father belonged to the musician's union here. And Henry gave him the name of his brother. "Henry -- Henry, please go out of the way there." Where were we? Q.

We stopped a few times, becaue he bought ice cream for my son. My son never had ice cream before. It was the first time that he had ice cream.

He worked in very fine restaurants and very fine hotels, and he -- we pushed our son to college. My son graduated Renselear Polytechnic Institute, and we made a living here, a life here. Q. What -- what do you think gave you the strength to get through all of this? A. Up there. I think he did a lot of things, God did a lot of things.
