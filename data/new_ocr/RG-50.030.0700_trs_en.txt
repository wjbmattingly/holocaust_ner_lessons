A: Œ air force Œ air Œ airport. Q: Wa Œ it sounds like it was very much then a military town. Were all Polish cities had so many bases from the military, or was Lvov exceptional in some way? A: No, Lvov was a third size city in Poland. It was a very well known, years, years before, centuries before, as a commercial crossroad from the Baltic to Black Sea. Q: Yeah. A: And so there was a lot of influx of the Armenians, and the people from the east who were trading, going through. And th en later on it developed quite a well-known cultural center. And it was Œ it had this specific atmosphere. Lvov was somehow unique in that sense that if you meet anywhere somebody from Lvov, you always have something to talk about and you ask each other, where did you live, what street? And was a very patriotic city, but toward the end of the first World War, after the Austrian empire fell through Œ lost the war, Galicia, that was part of the Austrian empire was again, somehow, having problems with the minorities, and there was a big minority of the Ukrainians, wanted to have Lvov as their city, and there were strong battle in Œ for several months in the Œ with the arm Œ Prussian Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 8army. At that time a Œ Russia entered already the war, already, after the revolutions, it was communist Œ Q: Right. A: Œ army that wanted to take over. At that time also was the battle for Œ they entered also the eastern border of Poland and wanted supposedly, as Lenin said, they wanted to bring communism to Germany. And so, in that battle, most of the young people who were fighting for the independence were already at the front, being busy, so the students of Lvov, the students of universities Œ there were a couple of polytechnic and university very well recognized. And the young children, like Boy Scouts, and Œ and we re helping out and it retained its independence from the Ukrainians. It became part afterwards Œ Q: Of Poland. A: Œ it became part of Polish, because [indecipherable] I can™t re-recall how many miles yet to the Russian border, because it, you know, was se veral hundreds of miles to the Russian border, so it was still well in Œ well in Poland. Q: But it was close to the Ukrainian border. A: Well, not Œ at that time, Ukrainian border, there were couple of hundred miles. Q: Oh, still a few hundred miles. A: Right, because Russia Œ Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 9Q: Was part Œ it was Œ A: Ukraine was part of Œ Q: Œ it was part of of Russia, yeah. A: Œ Russia at that time. Q: Yeah, yeah. A: At that time Ukraine was still Œ when the communists came, they made Ukraine Œ Q: Communist. A: Œ park Œ part of Russia, communistic part of Soviet Œ Q: I just was Œ I had thought it was so close to the border. I didn™t realize there was still several hundred miles distance. A: Mm-hm, right. I would say 200 - 300 miles. Q: Yeah. Tell me a little bit about your mother. Her name again was? A: Maria . Q: Maria . And how Œ what was her role? Was she Œ does she also have a Œ a Œ an occupation, or was her occupati on taking care of the children? A: Before she got married, she was a teacher. Q: Okay. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 10A: Or also she worked in bank. And then when she got married, one of the things that life of the officer was very often on the move. You spend few years here, few years there, and then we were born, so she really took care of us for rest of her life. Q: Was Œ was your family from Lvov for generations, or had your parents moved there from other parts of Poland? A: On my mother™s side and my husband Œ my father™s side, there were members of Lvov community. I don™t know ex actly, looking past a hundred years Œ more than hundred years of my father™s families Œ progeny, and the relatives who were, but I know that they were quite well-known in the 19th century. And on my mother™s side, they were well-recognized as book editors and bookselle rs. That was on my mother™s side, and also when the oil started at the lower part of Poland, close to Ukrainian border, some of the Œ the member s of my mother™s family were owners of the Œ of the Œ Q: Oil wells? A: Œ oil wells, or participated in some kind of things. Q: In the oil business probably. How woul d you describe your chi Œ the home life inside your home? Were your parents very strict, were they lenient? What were some of their values? What are the things you remember them, I guess sh-sharing with you that were important to them? Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 11A: I think that I™m Œ I gained much from Œ from them, from the teaching, or wi Œ they were very moral people. Q: Were they religious? A: They were religious and they attended the church as we Œ although, when I started going to the Œ the primary school, it was a public school, but they were also Œ sometime the Œ the schools run by nuns, or the Œ for the girls, or for boys, the monks. But I was in public school, but we had also gone through a Œ learning religion in school, and attended all Œ part of our life was living also a religious life. And all our morals are based on that, and I think that Œ that added to the strength afterwards, that we, when difficulties started later in life, and the tragedy started, that the Œ the base was that we had loving parents, and my mother would Œ although I always felt that she preferred my brothers to me, she was very st rict Œ stricter with me. It™s only when I was grown-up, much grown-up, she Œ she told me that she expected more from me, and was stricter with me because the women have harder life, and have much more to depend on th e moral self-awareness than the boys. So there Œ therefore, difference that I felt as a negative thing, was in the form of trying to make me stronger. Q: Do you think it worked? A: I think so. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 12Q: Yeah. Which Œ which pare nt were you closer to? A: I was close to my mother because she was always around. But I was also Œ I knew that I was in Œ in ma Œ in the eyes of my father a little princess. I would Œ wouldn™t do anything Œ even he expected al so a lot of me. Fortunately I was a good student, so there was never this Œ any conflicts like that. But I remember once she wa Œ he was passing by my Œ our bedroom, and a rug th at was near my bed was crooked. And I remember him telling me, yo u, with your artistic inclination, how can you stand a crooked rug? And tha Œ you know, that must have been so many years ago, but something like this happened . And I was very proud of my father, he had been Œ ha-had many frie nds, and was considered quite an Œ outstanding as a person. Q: Was he an outgoing person? A: I would say he was more like home pe rson, whenever he was coming. He was not too much into going out so much, but usually when he would come home, I would remember him readi ng newspapers, and staying home, and Œ and also going visiting with the re Œ other relatives. But he was also very much feeling responsible for his subordinates. So he was always on the lookout, or check ing out with them. So I understand they had a great admiration for him, which proved later on in life, when they were looking for him. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 13Q: Would you descri be your childhood? How would you describe your childhood? How would you, when you think back on th ose years before the war, what is the feeling that you have? A: I would say, on Œ like most other girls, I would say si milar experiences in school. I was sometimes teacher™s pe t, so I suffered a little bit sometimes, because being somehow shown as a Œ an example, makes you an enemy of some people. But anyway, mostly a good, pleasant type of fa-family, my mother and fa ther, and also the distant family, aunts and uncles visiting, everybody will Œ even later on they, when as an adult, and some aunt, or some uncle from Œ from Poland , when we visited, they remembered me as a child. And I remembered how close they were to our family. So it was a, I would say, more Œ mostly [indecipherable] except that we were not rich, because the army people are not rich, so I knew that from time to time they might have had some problems, financial problems if something extra happened. But I, fortunately, I don™t remember any big sickness in my childhood or my brothers™, except for scarlet fever and diphtheria. But at that time there was a kind of Œ every Œ every child almost, had it, and you had to be in the hospital, because there was epidemic of scarlet fever, so that they would not allow children to stay home. So I spent so me six weeks or something like that in the Œ in the hospital, but Œ my brothers, too, at di fferent times. But nothing really tragic. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 14Q: How would you describe your parents™ relationships to one another? A: It was Œ from what I can say, and could feel, there was a great bond between them. It was great respect for my fath er, and my Œ my mother also had her husband™s respect. Th Œ I coul dn™t remember angry voices, but if there were Œ and I am sure that it™s impossible to live through life without any Œ any little disagreements or something, but I was not aware of any problem of any serious consequences. Q: Did you have close friends at school? A: Yes, I had several friends and Œ and Œ and one, especially one whose parents were also friends of my parents. He was a famous painter in Œ in Poland, and her mother was not working, was also taking care. But Barah (ph) was the only child, so we were very often spending time, either at our house, or at her house. Q: What was her last name? A: Martuszuk (ph) Q: Martuszuk (ph). How would Œ you mentioned a little bit that your parents or your family was not particular ly well-to-do. Would you sa Œ A: [indecipherable] the army Œ Q: Yeah. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 15A: Œ people, you know, kind of difficult, and because the army Œ Poland was then, you know, just rising from th e ashes. And I think in Poland was starting to build the economy and industry. So it Œ a regular situation with the army, it™s Œ wasn™t that they were not very [indecipherable]. Maybe there were people who had some special assignments, or something like that, would get extra money for trouble, or something, a presentation or someth ing. It™s not that we™re poor. Q: No. A: I didn™t feel the poverty. Q: Okay. A: But no Œ from knowledge of how the situation was. As an adult I could recognize that we™re middle class, well educated, and middle class very much interested in the social and cultural life. But not probably exte nsively or too often outside of Poland . Q: Did your family own a car? A: No, we did not own a car. The horses, the [indecipherable] or how you call the horses were usually belonged to Œ to the commander of the battalion, like my father was. And so, we sometimes went on some excursion we went, but we also went Œ the car also belonged to the unit there. Q: I see. So sometimes you had use of it. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 16A: So sometimes we used it, the car. Q: Did you have a radio at home? A: Yes. Q: Okay. A: But there that Œ that time, was the radio when you Œ you Œ with the crystal, when you put the small crystal to here, to connect Œ Q: I don™t even know what that ra Œ kind of radio looked like. A: Not just a Œ a box with the microphone that you could hear Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ I mean, behind the screen. And there was the classic things with the Œ some screw that you tried to correct Œ Q: The sound? A: Œ the sound to get the connection, because that Œ you probably only would have the Œ only the radio from Lvov, all the Œ in Poland, but you would have to maneuver to get that thing working. Q: The signal. A: Signal. Q: Yeah, yeah. Tell me a little bit about Lvov as a city that you mentioned earlier, seemed to be multicultural. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 17A: Very much so. Q: Who wi Œ and how was it divided, if you would know? First of all, about how large a city was it in the 1930s? How many poppi Œ people? A: In Œ 350,000 before the war. Q: Okay. A: And it had about 65 percent Poles, I would say about 20 percent Ukrainians, or maybe less. I would say less, but they had qui te a large Jewish section, Jewish Œ the Œ the Jews of Poland were the Œ the assimi Œ most of them were the assimilated Jews, or the Jews who called themselves Poles, and went with us to school. And there were also smal Œ small sections in Lvov Œ well, small, it™s relative, where there were Orthodox places. They had very busy market, very well developed, and they had several synagogues. A nd was kind of a very prou Œ Lvov was proud of is that they had Armenians, quite a lot of [indecipherable] maybe t Œ five or more thousand Armenians, who are actually, they came to Lvov in the 16 th century, 17 century, so you couldn™t rea lly differentiate that they were Armenians. They had different names, but they had Œ the cathedr al was Armenian cathedral, or Catholic Armenian order, and there was also the Ukrainian cathedral, a very well recognized, very well-known [indecipherable] Saint George Cathedral, for the Ukrainians, but they were not ort Œ Russia n orthodox, but they were Yoonyots(ph). That was the Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 18reun Œ in the Œ at the end of 16th century there was a reunion of the orthodox Ukrainians with the Roman Œ Q: Catholic church. A: Œ Catholic church, and they recognized the Pope. And so you actually could go to Œ to the masses, except that they use the Ukrainian language and Ukrainian letters, which Œ Q: Rather than Latin. A: Rather than Latin. Q: Yeah. A: But that was different, and especially since lat Œ in the Catholic church had Latin Œ Q: Yes. A: Œ so for most of the people who did not know Latin, it was also boring. Q: Yeah. Did you ha Œ A: And then I also about several Œ quite a Œ a lot, I don™t know what percentage, German, especially Austrian German, because Galicia in the Œ when Poland was divided, Poland uke Œ Lithuanian Ukraine Œ Q: Right. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 19A: Œ and Poland, the commonwealth was divided between Russia, Prussia and Austria. Q: Right. A: So if you know that situation, many of the Austrians came in and stayed, and very often became Poles, even better Poles patriotically than Œ than some peasants who Œ peasants or some workers who didn™t have schooling or something, that as the ch-change after the war happened, there were many Œ and during the 19 th century there™s Œ you probably know from history, there were several uprising against Russia to free Poland Œ Q: Yes. A: Œ and Lithuania from Russian tsars at that time. And I know the incidents of people who Œ was one professor that I read somewhere that small story, one professor at the University of Lvov, they were talking about one of the uprising in Œ in Poland in the [indecipherable] what they said congress was a part of Russian Œ Russian part of Poland who stepped up the activities, and they said, where I Œ where are you sons, they asked the prof essor. He said, he Œ they are doing the patriotic duty. They went to defend Poland, to Russian part. Beca Œ and he was of Austrian Œ Austrian parentage Œ Q: Origin, yeah. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 20A: Œ originally, because many, many of them Œ as a matter of fact, my Œ the mother of my girlfriend in Poland , her parents lived in Vienna, and sometimes she went to visit her. So, there was some [indecipherable] Q: Yeah, some influence. A: Œ many of these people became as Polish as Œ Q: As the next person, yeah. A: Right. Q: In school, did you intermingled, or did your family know any Jewish people? A: Yes. Q: Okay. A: I sat with a Jewish girl. I didn™t have much in common with some of the girls from Œ because where Œ in our neighbor hood, I think, were many small shop owners. And they somehow kept much to themselves, Jewish pe ople. But we also have some doctors [indecipherable] and some very, very good students, too, and it was like, I would say in the class of 35 or 40 children, there would be at least 15 Jewish children. And when the lessons in religion, everybody was obliged to take Œ participate, and we had the priest come fo r the Catholic girls, the rabbi come, take the to another room, or Œ or we went ou t to another room. And also Ukraine, or [indecipherable] which is the Ukrainians how they called themselves before the Œ Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 21all the nationalistic fights. But Œ and then th ey Œ and we had couple Protestants girls and there was a church, a Protestant church of Habsburg den-denomination. So it was an Œ a Œ I cannot remember how many Œ how many, but I know that I sat Œ there were two Œ two girls to each seat, and I was sitting with the Œ with the girl who was Jewish. Q: Did your parents talk about politics at home? About what was going on in the country, what was going on in the world? A: I-I Œ I think we were well informed, but there were Œ I had sometimes discussion with my father, what I was like Œ about medicine, or abou t something. I that Œ when my father would come and have his late l unch, because at four o™clock it™s neither lunch nor supper. So I would sit and ask of Œ my mother was very upset. Will you stop talking about all the medical things, or Œ I don™t know why it was of some interest at one point for me. But we di scussed probably because of school, and learning and it wasn™t somehow forced on us, any patriotic things, or you were ordered by school to march, or to Œ ordered by Œ you did some of the things, like celebrate anniversaries and Œ and ho Œ hope that Poland is honorable with everything, and somehow you knew that th ere was some bad things happened, you heard about some Œ somebody murdering somebody, some kind of a trial of someone, which later on, I understand ye ars later proving that it was innocent Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 22person. But anyway, somehow the Œ it was in the news, so you couldn™t help even overhearing what they went to the Œ to shop, or where they went in Œ in the tramways, because the tramways were the way the communication was quite well-developed in Œ in Lvov, and Œ Q: So Œ okay. Did you want to finish the thought? A: Mm, no. Q: Okay. Did you Œ were Œ were Hitler™s name or Stalin™s name, were they well known? Did people talk about them, or were they foreign countries, and they would have little effect? A: No, there was definitely a well-known situation, a nd I remember during one of my last Œ maybe not last Œ in 1938, in vacation, I was in Warsaw with my aunt and uncle, the brother of my father. And I also lived with Œ sometimes they had the house be Œ residence outside of Warsaw . And I remember in ™38, at the time of Czechoslovakia and anschluss , and the speeches of Hitler, and how we all felt, you know, all Œ really with the goose pimples. And Œ Q: You fe Œ you felt? A: Goose pimples. Q: Goose pimples. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 23A: When we heard the voice of Hitler talking about his enemies, and how Œ and then also sometimes on the radio too, you heard the [indecipherable] repeating his threats after Czechoslovakia and starting to repeat the threats against Poland , which some reporters translated it, of course. But also you heard the voices of Hitler, it still to my Œ I think to my dying day, the wor Œ hearing his voice raises the hair on my back of my head. Q: Frightening. A: Frightening, and like if you hear evil, or f Œ almost subconsciously because at that time we didn™t realize what will ha ppen. But the hatred that was coming through was so difficult to Œ even to underst and, that Œ that amount of threats, or that amount of hatred, or that amount of Œ and also, on the other hand, my father had a very relaxed or Œ the way of ta lking about the army, and about that Poland is preparing for difficult times, and we are sure that we will surviv e, and also would Œ toward the end, when there were the alliances with England and France , that we™ll have some help and some support from the west, if Hitler will attack us. And that they will defend Poland to the last drop of blood. And somehow that right would be on our side. [phone ringing] Q: Mm-hm, yeah. A: And so, in that sense, we looked with some hope to Œ [interruption][break] Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 24Q: So, there are very troubling things that are happening, but also signals that you™ll be safe, that things will be okay. A: Feeling. Q: Yeah. A: Feeling hope, and also based on the Œ our faith, religious faith, and feeling that we were not the people who could cause the war, but rather to defend our honor, but not to kind of being afraid that we are facing such a mighty enemy, and such a ruthless enemy. So unfortunately, this happened. But it still, from what I understand, the Germans, when talking about the September war, 1939 war, in their reports said that some of the bravery was enviable, about Poles before they died, or before they had to leave the post, or so mething. That™s all, there were still monument in some places where was almost like [indecipherable] Q: Yeah. A: Where everybody would die without giving up the defense. So Œ and then, also the feeling that we will Œ the goodness should win in the long run, but we didn™t know how the things were. Q: Okay. I™d like to get a sense of, as August 1939, or as summer 1939 is developing, what is it that you are hearing, what is it that is in the conversations and in the air? Are Œ are your parents talking more and more about things? And Œ and Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 25I™d like to know personally, for you, for your family, where were you, and how did you learn of the war? A: Well, the instant of the war, I very well remember, the first of September. I Œ when I came back from my aunt, near Kraków , where I spend the vacation, she brought me around sixth or fifth of August. And I knew that the Œ at that time there were some unpleasant meetings betw een the German and Russian people, diplomatic, some conferences or whatever, we didn™t know yet at that time. And because that war seemed to be imminent, my aunt and uncle brought me home to Lvov. And by then my father was not sleepi ng at home, but staying on his post where he was assigned at part of Lvov, at Lychakiv, near where his whole unit was at. And my mother took me on the first of September to say hello to my father, because this was around Œ like around 10 o™clock or so in the morning, to greet Tadeusz after coming back from vacation, and to say hello, to see him, but then return without him, with my mother. And I was returning by tram number one. That I remember too, the tram number one was actually traveling from nearby where my father was staying, but he™s quite a lot across from where we lived, and by the time we were passing mid-after Œ sitting in the Œ in the train and train was going, and we started hearing something like bombs, or so me shot Œ shooting, or something that sounded like thunder, or we didn™t know what it was. And close to our church, Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 26which is Œ which was not too far from the place where we lived, at that number one stopped, and the tramway Œ an d people were trying to wa tch the planes flying over, and people were saying no, th-these are not Polish, these are not Polish planes. And then we hear some of the bombs breaking sound, and the Œ the conductor of the tramway said, you have to hurry home and try to get into the basement or somewhere to hide, because this is the Œ we are attacked from the air by Germany . I remember then walking back, I saw a woman Œ I don™t know how I remember that, but carrying a pillow with blood on it. And she said my daughter was hit by Œ whether by shrapnel, or whether by a bric k or something, because of the falling house, that her Œ her head was on that pillow when her daughter was, and she was crying and carrying before we got to our house. And we Œ we got to the base Œ basement, but actually what Œ later on it wa s arranged there were some neighbor Œ neighborhood houses wh ere had bigger basements, much more prep-prep-prepared to take some people in. And so the rest of [indecipherable] before the Russians came, before the 22nd of September, when the Russians came to Lvov, they entered Poland on the 19th of September Œ Q: Hang on a second. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 27A: Ni Œ no Œ Poland, 17th of September they entered Œ they crossed the border. By the time they came to Lvov, Lvov was being surrounded by the German army. And Œ Q: Okay, let™s stop there for a second, thou gh. You™re in Œ you™re in the basement originally, you know, the first one, which is not that well prepared. And if I can just repeat what I understood is, you went to say hello and greet your father on your way back from vacation in Kraków , and while you are traveling home on tram number one, the war starts. And Œ A: The Œ the bombardment, the Œ Q: The Œ the Œ the bombardment comes. So you didn™t know the war Œ war was starting, you just saw the bombs Œ A: Saw the Œ the airplanes Œ Q: Planes. A: Œ and the people talking th Œ oh no, these are Polish, oh no, no, these are not Polish airplanes. Q: Yeah. A: And then hearing the whistle Œ Q: Of the bombs. A: Œ of the bombs. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 28Q: Well, it meant that, I mean, Lvov being so far east Œ A: Well, it™s Œ but for the airplanes Œ Q: Germ Œ yeah, it™s not long. It™s not long at all. A: Not only that, you have to remember that Poland was surrounded from three sides. Only the Russian border was not use Œ being used as an army for Germany. Czechoslovakia was taken, and Slovakia was a Hitler friend. That™s the south of Poland . Q: And of course Œ A: Prussia. Q: Yeah. A: Prussia was the German place of Teutonic knights, which you know, as Lithuanian Teutonic knights Œ Q: Right. A: Œ to that part of Œ of what was Poland at one point. So the north part, and all the Œ Q: West. A: Œ all the west. Q: Yeah. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 29A: So the Œ the Œ Poland was like taken into squeeze. So I don™t know whether these planes came from Œ maybe from Czechoslovakia , which wasn™t too far. Q: That™s true. A: And Œ but the Œ the advance was swift. Q: Well tell me Œ tell me then, in those three weeks, if it started from the first Œ A: Three Œ Q: Œ until the Œ until the Russians enter on the 17th, they cross the border Œ A: Yes, but the war was still going on, the Poland did not surrender until the 29th of S-September, Warsaw fell. Q: Okay, what I™m interested in is what is happening with you and your family in this environment. So, in those three weeks, where were you, where were your younger brothers, where was your mo ther, and where was your father? A: My father was at his post, and from time to time was sending us, either through his adjutant or some telephone that everything is all right with him, and to take care, and hope for the better, that the German, as a matter of fact, stopped Œ were stopped around Lvov, they could not enter Lvov. And then there was a day of quiet, the 22nd. The Œ actually the evening of 21st, all the ar-artillery fire, because this was constantly, we had constant air raids, a nd constant, at one point wa Œ when the Germany was surrounding Lvov, constant battle. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 30Q: So did you stay at home? Did you stay in the cellar? A: We stayed at home on the first floor. Q: Okay. A: And went to s Œ no, we didn™t go to school. Q: Okay. A: The school were Œ was sto Œ Q: Stopped? A: Œ closed. And Œ but I remember going to visit my friend and spending some time, when Œ but one of the things that Œ th at my parents, probably every parent was trying to get some preparation, some food storage for something that will take longer. Q: That™s right, that wouldn™t spoil. A: That is it not Œ right. That Œ so very often it was to go Œ this is still the Russians are not in. Q: Yeah. A: And then the Œ on the 22nd, they enter Lvov . There is no more bombardment, there is no more artillery fight. But the other things started to Œ Q: Happen. A: Mm-hm. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 31Q: Okay. So I™m going to try and repeat what I Œ what I think I understand, is that in those first weeks, the Germans have surrounded Lvov, and there™s fighting. A: Only the last few days before they Œ the Russians came. The Œ Q: Okay, so until then, in those first two weeks Œ A: Mm-hm. Q: Œ let™s say 14 - 15 days, there was no fighting in Lvov? A: Not inside Lvov . Q: Not inside. And Œ and so was Œ was there food still, were the stores filled, were Œ did people go out in the streets? A: Yes, the Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ would be like Œ you probably ha ve seen some of the films showing Britain. You know, there Œ there were bombardments, although they were not surrounded by the Germans, but at Œ at the time when bombardments, the s Œ the s-sirens were Œ Q: Right. A: Œ [indecipherable] and then you run to the basement. Q: Okay. A: And then the sirens would sound ag ain, and you would go back to your apartment. But then, toward the end when Germany surrounded Lvov, which was, Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 32I think five days before, or maybe more, I can™t [indecipherable] or I would look at the book, and we would know. But a Œ a Œ around few days, there was a constant, about 10 day Œ now I remember, 10 days, be cause my mother saying 10 days that we were staying and sleeping in the basement. Q: So you were under siege. At that point you were under siege. A: Right. Q: And could wa Œ could I Œ would it be accurate to understand that the Germans Œ the n Œ th-the German Wehrmacht more or less conquered the city for the Russians let them in? A: No. Q: Okay. A: No. Q: Okay, so Œ A: They Œ they Œ from what I gather Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ from historic point of view, I am somehow amateur historian, and there was meeting with the Russians on the 21 st of September. Q: Between the Germans and the Russians? A: Between Germans and Russians. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 33Q: Okay. A: At first when we n Œ we learned ab out Russians coming in, from the news, but wha-what kind of news could come while wa s in Œ in wartime is very difficult to say what is true and what not. But at that time, in a sense, we were puzz Œ Poles were puzzled: why the Russians come? There was an alliance between Poland and Russia in 1933 Œ 32 first, and completed in ™34 for non-aggression pact. So supposedly we were free on the east, but unfortunately, the Russians broke it. To this day they say there was no war. So, fo r example, the prisoners of war who had been killed, are not recognized the victims of the war to that kind of Œ some kind of the defense that Russian would, after finally admitting that it was Russians, at first they said th-the Œ the German forces came with the po Œ the Russian prisoners of war who are in Russia. But at that time there were no Germans in Russia. Q: So, if there was a bombardment of Œ of Lvov , and all of a sudden it becomes quiet, how do you explain that? Did the Ge rmans retreat and allow the Russians to come in? A: We didn™t see them retreat, wis Œ we heard stoppage of the artillery fire. Q: Okay. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 34A: And then the eerie kind of quiet. We di dn™t know what to expect from left to right, whether the bombs coming, or whether the artillery will be taken. And we, at that time, most of the people didn™t think that the Russians came as friends. Q: So what Œ when was the first time you saw a change? When was the first time you saw the Russian army come Œ A: Immediately. Q: What happened? A: The Œ marching into it, and they Œ of ten the pre-war communist people put on the red band on Œ on the arms, and turned into militia, and immediately would have Œ the traffic would be stop because they would go into the stores that had food, and would get everything out, and I don™t know whether to take to Russia or to feed the germ Œ the soldiers. But immediately we felt there was some lack of food, started they all Œ they started to Œ how you would call it? Give a special cards to go and buy bread or some Œ Q: Rationing. A: Rationing of food. And also Œ and so the army, who, I think it was almost to pretend that they were poor army men, be cause they were not as dressed when you take the pictures of these people who came, they were very poorly dressed, the Œ the arms are like they car Œ the shoot Œ Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 35Q: The guns. A: The guns were sometimes tied with strings or something, you could see, and the people who were passing were Œ looked no t so much unfriendly, but very much incommunicado. And also the chaos of some of the peop le, the lower elements of society, starting to, you know, to take advantage of whatever, to Œ whether they were stealing, or some, that I don™t know. Q: Looting, that sort of thing. A: Right. Q: Okay. So would you say there was a Œ for a little while there was a vacuum of authority, and it was just chaotic Œ A: Yes. Q: Œ even though the army was there? A: The Russian army came in. Q: Yes, yes. A: But our army was taken immediately, our prisoners of war. There were no Polish soldiers. Q: So after you had said hello to your father when you came back from vacation, did you see him again? A: No. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 36Q: Okay. A: Because he was always on the post. Q: Okay. All right. And was he taken as a prisoner of war? A: He was taken from Œ we got a small piece of card Œ piece of paper, carried by some of the soldier who were let go, some of officers were immediately taken, but soldiers not always. And some of th em got nearby, the camp outside of Lvov , where they kept the Polish officers, and Œ and the Œ you know, surrounded them, and took off their insignia, and told them that they are prisoners of war, and not to get into the ta Œ into touch with Œ with relatives. So this soldier brought a small piece of paper that I am healthy, I am all right. Please take care of the children and of yourself and God protect you and a couple of words like that. And then a couple of days later, somebody else went who wa s one of the students at the university, who was part of this young pe ople preparing for defense Œ Q: Yes. A: Œ re Œ not in the army, but Œ Q: You mentioned that, yeah. A: Right? Q: Yeah. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 37A: So he told Œ and he Œ not me, my mo ther, that the saw Œ he went close to Œ Viniki, was a small town outside Lvov Œ well, actually resort town. And there they were kept under Œ within a wire Œ wired section. But he saw this taking of the insignia, and they could not come close and talk to them. But somehow, if I remember, he just might have spoken so mething. And then, afterwards, nothing. Q: Nothing. A: Nothing at all until we learned later on that they were being transported by foot to Tarnopol , which was like closer to the Russian border Œ Ukrainian, but actually it was Russian border, and Œ about 200 miles or so, and they were put on the trains there. And from what I know the story, later on that I learned, but only in December, or late November, we got a card from Starobilsk in Ukraine, near Kiev, that a Œ a Œ a Œ a letter Œ a small Œ a small card, that they were promised that they could write once a month on the card. No letters, but just a card. A-And he wrote to us that some of the friends of ours, friends who are with him, are the friends of the man who was living in Œ w ith the apartment above us. He was the judge of appellate court, and quite well recognized. And so my father wrote that the friends of Mr. Oyuk(ph) are with us also. So it™s not only soldiers that were taken prisoner, because reserve was taken, Polish reserve, going into the army, and among the reservists you had doctors and judges and Œ and all part of this society. So Œ Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 38Q: And then? A: Then there was another couple of let Œ short cards, that I am all right. We send some packages. You could Œ you could se nd, I don™t know ho-how many, if my mother send, probably did, becaus e at the beginning of April Œ Q: 1940 Œ 19 Œ A: Œ no cause Œ because they did not come every month Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ these cards, so we didn™t know much . But at beginning of April 1940, came a telegram from couple of officers, to him, and to his friends who were officers of other units, please don™t write to u Œ to us. Don™t send any packages or letters, we are being moved in an unknown destina tion. About new address, we will let you know. It was the last thing that we got from my father. And it was Œ just happens that it was close to the day, 13th of April, 1940, when the NKVD, that™s the police Œ Russian police, and some communist, local communist and translator came with Œ early in the morning and took us Œ came to us and said, yo u have half an hour to get up and to get down to the lorry that™s waiting outside to ta ke you by train to Siberia. Q: Oh my gosh. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 39A: Then I started crying, because I realized Œ which a Œ I think I mentioned that I ro Œ told the story to Allen Paul, who wrote the book about Katyn Œ at that time, I was 12 years old Œ at I Œ that time, I realized that just now, my father is being put into another place, and we are going to Siberia, and that we ge Œ will get lost, and we™ll never meet. And I couldn™t Œ I was really hysterical, almost. And the man who was interpreter, and also he was the driver of the truck, and he was upstairs, and he was trying to tell me don™t worry, don™t worry, you are going where your father is, so you will see your father there. And so that somehow made me stop. Q: What was the behavior of those ot her soldiers who marched in, of the NKVD? How wa Œ what was their manner? A: Well, first of all, we were undressed. My brothers were still asleep, because my mother woke me up with the Œ upstairs there was an Œ how you call? Search [indecipherable] house, that we li Œ the Russian s were upstairs, because the Œ you could hear the Œ Q: The footsteps. A: Œ the footsteps, and somehow what we set Œ search Œ searching the house. Q: I see. A: And couple of Œ like an hour later, Mrs. Oyuk(ph), with her three children, was going down, and called my mother, on Œ rang the bell. My mother came to the door Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 40Œ this is like six o™clock in the morning Œ came to the door, and she said, please, go to church. Our church Œ my mother Œ Q: Right. A: Œ Mrs. Œ Mrs. Oyuk™s mother is usually there. Please tell her that we are being taken to Siberia . And went down with the NKVD people. And about maybe half an hour later, or maybe less, we heard this ba ng on the door with pistols, or whatever hard things, they kicked the door. And so we Œ or, I was awake, because my mother woke me when Mrs. Oyuk (ph) came, and my brothers we re still sleeping. And they came and said, half an hour, get dressed, a nd take some of the basic things, and get down to the truck. Unfortunately, my mother someho w panicked. She didn™t know what Œ what do you take to Siberia ? What do you take what you have, especially since, you know, after this September month, lot of our food, what we had prepared was gone. And then also, at that time, we had an influx of communists from the eastern Œ from the western part of Poland , who came to Lvov. There were many refugees who came from the western part of Poland . And the communists, when the Œ when the Russians came in, organized the rooming places, ordering the people who own the apartment to take all to Œ not only ordering, sometimes during the night they opened the door and let some people, and said, these are communists, they are going to Russia, they are waiting for their visas, but they™re Œ you have to Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 41take care of them. They were the refugees, but most of these people were communists who were, as they expressed it, they were waiting to go to paradise, you know, Russian paradise. So, at that time, the Œ there was eight men and one woman, a wife of one of them. And she real ized that my mother didn™t know Œ she wasn™t dressed. The soldier for bed Œ forbade my mother to close the bathroom door, that she could dress and no Œ get all together that we could dress. And he stood at the door, open door, and they wouldn™t give us any keys to the attic, where we had our luggage, that we could use it. They were afraid to leave us without the [indecipherable] . So the woman who was the wife of this communist from Lódz, I believe, she realized Œ she took the capes, or covers of a bed, spread out and put some pillows and some clothing. She opene d the shelves of some of the chest Œ chest of drawers, she took some of the things and threw in, and tied it as a bundle. Q: So in other words, your mother was in a state of shock. A: Yes. But in the sense, how do you know when you suddenly awakened and you are told you have to pack up Œ for the children, you know, my brothers were Œ one was 10, and one was seven. So the small ch ildren, you have to Œ what do you take? Q: Yeah. A: You think of clothing, or the Œ a good thing, as an example was that Œ was our truck, because we had such little things, so few things this woman put for us, Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 42although there were two big bundles, but Œ and we had the small dog, the Chihuahua, little Chihuahua with us, we take. The first time that I heard this dog to Œ moaning, when they came in, this dog, the small, you know, kind. But we were to wait for the Œ next door was a banker™s family; the wife of a banker and her son, who finished Œ was just finished high school, about. I Œ I don™t think we knew each other very well, we just rec ognized ourselves at the Œ were taken on the same truck. But we waited there two and a half hours, or maybe more. When Œ this young man had a good head on his shoulders. He put vodka in front of these Russian soldiers, on the table, and they started saying, take an ything of value; like jewelry, like silver, or things that you can sell in Œ in Œ in Russia for Œ for Œ Q: Food. A: Œ food, for anything. And they really Œ they filled three-fourths of the [indecipherable] with their baggage for two people, and we had four, and we had just small things. So, somehow Œ and al so the sa Œ depended on the people, NKVD people. There were people Œ some people realized that this is a mother with the children, and you know, somehow followed orders, or somehow had the human instinct dictate a little bit, the dic Œ the behavior. Q: Well, in what way was the human instinct shown? Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 43A: Well, that this man allowed this young boy to somehow entertain themselves, talking to them. Q: Okay. A: In the meantime, they were advising wh at she should take, what is possible for her to take. Q: For your mother, or for his family? A: No, no, no, this Œ Q: His family. A: Œ this family. We stayed in the Œ Q: The truck. A: Œ on the truck. Q: Yeah. A: So we learned there were different Œ different people also, in helping. Q: So Œ so right after you get this telegram that says we™ll tell you what our address is, you get the knock in the night, or the Œ now early morning. A: Well, I Œ it was 13th Œ the beginning of April, was the telegram. Q: The tele Œ telegram. And on the 15th Œ A: And actually, from what later we learned Œ Q: Yeah. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 44A: Œ it was the first Œ fourth or fifth day of April that they started taking people out of the camp, Starobilsk, driving them to another place, where they didn™t know. Q: Okay. A: Where they were killed. Q: So do you think that by the time you were deported, your father had already been a Œ A: No, no. Q: No. A: It was when Œ he might have been in the first group, you know, in the Œ the Œ there were close to 4,000 prisoners. Q: Yeah. A: So they did not take all at once, so they were series. And I don™t know whether he was in first series or Œ can™t Œ can™ t learn about it. But we only knew from that man that the chauffeur of Œ of the truck, he said, don™t cry, don™t cry, you are going where your father is. You will fe Œ see your father. So he Œ nobody knew, you know, only regular people did not kn ow what the intentions of the Stalin and [indecipherable] were. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 45Q: I™d like to follow that thread about your father first, and then we™ll come back to you and the truck. When was it that yo u found out a Œ something about your father™s fate? At what point was this? Was this still during the war, or after the war? A: We learned, as the news was spread in 1943 Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ when the Germans, going back from Russia, they Œ they went the one Œ they almost took Moscow, but then they started withdrawing. And when they came near Smolensk, which is that Belarus now Œ Q: Yeah. A: Byelorussia, right? He Œ they were told by some local people that there was, at one point in 1940, in the spring of 19 40, some shooting and Œ but they couldn™t really see it, because this was on the place where the NKVD had the private houses, they had some, you know, from what I unde rstand, near Œ and Œ and the prisoners who were in ca Œ Katyn , were the prisoners from the [indecipherable] camp my father was in, which was near Œ in the Byelorussia, near Smolensk. And my father was taken to Ukraine, on the southern part. You know, th-they divided the group of people picking up the northern pa rt of Œ northeastern part of Poles, and the nor Œ nor Œ southeastern part of Poles. And Œ and they started di gging, or they were saying that some dog brought a human bone somewh ere. And the people Œ but people did Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 46not want to say, or somehow kept it in su ch a way that the Germans started feeling awkward about this Œ the whole thing. And they came to a place which was like the to Œ you planted trees in a very orderly manner, and new grow Œ growth, and they started digging. And they opened Katyn . So the news started on the 13 th Œ can you imagine the coincidence Œ 13th of April of 1943, when Germany was withdrawing from Russia, the Germans were talking about finding people and giving the names because they had the papers of these people, and they inquired Œ asked for the international Red Cross, from the people, where some American prisoners of war were being taken and shown it. Ther e was a very famous person from Italy, who was some scientist, who was asked to be th e witness as they were recovering this close to 4,000 bodies lying in there, but Œ and there was a question, when did it happen? And the Russians res Œ in respon se to that Œ we are already out of Russia , so we don™t know exactly Russian news, bu t the Russians are insisting that this is Goebbels™ and Hitler™s policy to break up the friendship between Russia and England, who are now allies. And they ar e reading openly on the radio in Kraków and in Warsaw , the names of the people whom they found. And the people from the international Red Cross Œ actually was the Œ more of a French Red Cross, because when Poles wanted international Red Cross, the Russians broke with the Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 47Polish émigré government that was staying in London , as the continuous Polish government, independent Poland . Q: Yeah, yeah, mm-hm. A: So that started writing books and news spread out. But by the time ™43 Œ must have been toward Œ well, ™40, I was, by then already in Africa, in the camps, but out of Russia, and out of Persia, and in Africa. So it was Œ it took another year and a half when I saw a small Œ not leaflet, a small bic Œ bulletin, with the pictures of these Œ of what happened, and Œ but it was only of Katyn Œ Katyn , and the names did not bel Œ not Œ we did not get the list yet, it took years after. But from what I understand, this was the only camp that was discovered by the Germans, and that had the name of Katyn, but then afterwards, in 1990, when Perestroika started, Gorbachev brought the letters showing that there were the camps of Starobilsk, which was in Ukraine, and Ostashkov , which was little bit north of Smolensk, where more of a police Œ Polish police, the pre-war Polish police was there, there were about 6,000 people. He gave that Œ that Œ the Polish people knew what happened to these prisoners of war. Q: So does that mean Œ was your fathe r™s name amongst those in 1990 that you found? Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 48A: At that time, yes, there were books. Already they were printing the Œ the first Œ they started printing from what they knew from the Polish sources who was arrested by the Germans Œ by the Russians. And pr obably was only one man who started a book, I don™t remember exactly what, but it was much later that he published the names of the people who were Œ Q: Arrested. A: Œ that are victims of Œ of murder, because Œ Q: I™m Œ I™m still Œ I™m sorry to interrupt, but I™m a little confused. In the mid1940s, you learn of Katyn, but your father™s name isn™t amongst them. A: Because they did not yet dig up. Q: Right. Then, for 50 years you don™t know anything. A: No. Q: And in 1990, Gorbachev provides additional information. A: Well, with the camps, what happened to the people from the camps, like my father™s camp. Q: Okay. A: That he was taken to Kharkov. Q: He was taken to Kharkov . Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 49A: And the Œ they murdered people in Kharkov, NKVD building, and took the bodies to the place, like Plakihatki (ph), which is a small surrounding, supposedly luxurious woods, and dachas, Russian dachas , and that was what later proved to be a big cemetery also for the Ukrainians from the previous persecutions. And Œ but at that time, we had the list, because they came with the list, also who was in the ca Œ in those camps. Q: Okay. But they came with the lists only after Perestroika, in 1990? A: I suppose so. That was Œ Q: Okay, so in other words Œ A: Œ only the German Œ the Œ we d Œ didn ™t get any documents about other camps. There were suggestions that near Œ that some children pl aying in some small town near Starobilsk found the Polish uniforms, buttons , you Œ officers™ buttons, and Œ and Œ so somehow there was, you know, gossipy kind of th ings, but sometimes this was built on the truth, but somehow you couldn™t believe it because it was half quiet, you could not repeat that very much. If you would repeat that, you would probably find yourself in some gulags. Q: Yeah. A: So the Russians were also Œ somehow did not touch the subject. Q: So did you ever conclusi vely find out specifically where your father met his end? Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 50A: No, when he was on the list of Starobilsk victims who were taken to Kharkov . Q: I see, so that™s what the Œ he was s Œ he was individually mentioned on that list. A: Right. As a matter of fact, there was a mi stake, they put my father™s name twice, because once they put him as a retired captain, and my mother Œ this writer, who was putting the names from just the Polish sources, the names who might have been in these camps, he lived in London . My mother lived in lon Œ London at the time, in Œ at the Gorbachev , you know, the 1990. So, my mother wrote to him that there is a mistake, my Œ my father was in active duties. But the Œ when they crossed Œ they did not cross his name, so he is twice Œ Q: I see. A: Œ in there; once in reservist, and on ce Œ in the retired, and once in the active duty. Q: Okay. A: The same person, with the same father and the same mother. Q: All right. I want to be able to understand this because it™s still a little confusing. It™s only in 1990s, I don™t know whether it™s 1990, ™91 or ™92 when Gorbachev releases documents that it is established that your father was from the camp, and he went to Kharkov Œ he was taken to Kharkov and then he was executed, and he is giv Œ and it™s on a list that the Russians pr ovide, by name. Somebody at that point, Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 51is writing a book. A Polish person who is writing a book and it originally has him down as retired, but your mother sees this, and corrects it. Is the book published? Is that Œ does she see Œ A: The book was published by [indecipherable] the author was Mischinsky(ph). He lived Œ he wa Œ I think he was an army person too, and he was connected with the Polish government in exile, in London. Q: Okay, but my question is: did you get this document from Gorbachev ? A: No. Q: That is, was that sent to the family members? A: No, this was Œ this wa s like a public knowledge. Q: So you Œ you were able to see it from someplace and then Œ and then later you saw it in a book? A: No, not really see it. Q: You never saw it? A: No, he Œ I had the book written by this man before Gorbachev . Mr. Mischinsky(ph) was making his assumption, or he had some inkling who was in the camps, from letters, from some Œ Q: I see. A: Œ on Œ probably connecting with the widows, or Œ Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 52Q: Okay. A: Œ women, or relatives, and they had the army, probably, in-intelligence. Army intelligence knew who were most of these people. Q: So did you already have Œ did you alre ady have an educated guess of where Œ what had happened to your fa ther, and the document that Gorbachev provided, or the documents that he provid ed, or the archives that he opened, only confirmed it for sure? A: Only confirmed Œ Q: I see. Okay. A: Œ that Œ that he was in Œ that the people who died in Kharkov were the people from Starobilsk. And the people who died Œ were in Ostashkov, died in Mierdnoya(ph). Q: I see. A: So it™s another place. So there were three main camps that Gorbachev Œ beside the first camp that the Germans discovered. Q: Wow. A: Because Gorbachev then Œ and started with the denouncing of Stalin. At first it was only the Œ that Stalin did it, but then afterwards it was kind of Œ Q: Yeah. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 53A: Œ government sponsored murder. Q: Let™s go back to you™re taken Œ you™re on the trucks, you™re Œ you have a neighbor that has more bundles than y ou do, and what happens to you and your brothers and your mother after that? A: Well, we™re taken to the station at Lvov, but not the regular train, but the Œ how you call Œ trade Œ Q: Mm-hm, freight train. A: Right. Where they have cattle trains, or Œ or standing there long, I would say several trucks with empty car. But already by that time when we came, because this woman with the Œ took longer, so it is now probably around 10 o™ clock or 11. As a matter of fact, this was Œ must have been around that time, because we had a nun who was thrown out by the so Œ Soviets, threw out the nuns from the nunneries, and monks from the Œ and they were homeless a nd without any way to live, and she had Œ she was a teacher of French, and my mother gave her a job of coming and teaching Œ teach us French Œ me, I don™t know whether my brothers participated. Maybe just halfway. And she came, and I remember seeing her face. She was an elderly woman, seeing us on the truck, and surrounded by the NKVD soldiers, and she is just to enter our Œ our apartment Œ apartment house, to go up Œ Q: To teach you. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 54A: Œ to teach us. And early Œ wordless, without a word, watching with a terrible feeling in her face, pained. So I remember that too, so it must have been about 10 o™clock or 11 when she was coming for less on, and then we had her eat lunch. And so, you know, su-supporting all these nuns who were thrown out of the places Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ of living, of monasteries. Q: So, by the time Œ A: And they take ma Œ the train Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ train station. Chao-Chaotic situa tion. Thousands and thousands of people crying, shrieking, calling names, getting lost because at the time it was Œ if I remember correctly, it was fairly rainy April couple of days. So the trucks were in between the mud, it was mounted. And then they Œ the soldie rs, not necessarily NKVD, regular soldiers, probably the army soldiers, were pushing people into the cars. And it was little bit higher then, you know, not Œ Q: Right. A: Œ you Œ you didn™t have steps, th-they were pushing, and people were disoriented. I remember seeing my aunt an d her son in one place, but we just Œ I don™t know whether we waved, but my mother said we Œ that she waved to us. She Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 55was taken to another train, or another cart. But anyway, wi Œ it was so ca Œ difficult to express, like a tragic situation when you can imagine thousands of people being thrown out of their houses, whether with some luggage, or not luggage, but taken and thrown into this, without knowing what happened, why that happened, and where they are going. Because we were not given, really , an address or anything. And we stayed Œ the Œ the truck had bank Œ benches on two ends, three levels. In the middle was a hole that you could use as a ba throom. Hole in the wa Œ in the floor, and the Œ since it was still fairly cold, there was an Œ a small iron Œ how you would say Œ Q: Stove? A: Stove. Q: Okay. A: To hold for the heating up, except that we didn™t have Œ you had to heat it by wood, but we didn™t have enough of wood, and they didn™t bring us wood, but that Œ that™s beside the point, but we were all crowded. Some people brought with them a little bit of food, so the first Œ the first day, all Œ that was Friday the 13th. Saturday morning we Œ the train started, one after another, you could see the lines. And each one had about 20 tru Œ 20 Œ Q: Wagons. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 56A: Œ wagons going. And then the people st arted praying, and they started singing religious songs. And crying, you know, ki nd of Œ you know, you could expect the people of Œ in despair. So that started our three weeks of travel. Q: What was with you and your mother an d your brothers? Were you Œ did you get a bunk? A: We got the bunk. I was on the upper bunk, and below was the Œ I don™t remember wa Œ Richard, that son of this woman, the banker™s son, where he was in, because I was on the upper, and was my mother, my brother slept on the third, I think. I Œ I really do not Œ it™s a blank. But very often I spend the time with Richard , looking through the grated window, small window in the Œ in the wagon, and, you know, talking and describing. We were Œ he was, you know, a young boy, I was 12 years old, but I somehow was intere sted in many things. We kept a kind of a friendship on Œ during that ride. Q: Did you describe Œ do you remember what it is you saw through those slats? A: Yeah, the Œ what we saw were Œ actually, from what I understand, they Œ the Russians widened the tracks because Poland had the tracks like western Europe Œ Q: Right. A: And Russians had the wide tracks. Q: Right. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 57A: So once they changed the tracks, we were going through some big cities. I remember Kiev. I remember some Œ some other Œ if I look at the map, Fufond (ph), and we coming to the Ural mountains and then Magnitogorsk , which is a center of Russian industry, steel industry, and Œ and then the Omsk and Tomsk . But this was actually si Œ at once, they wouldn™t let us Œ when we were still on the Polish territory, they wouldn™t let us out of that Œ Q: Wagon. A: Œ wagon. And it™s only after some days maybe, when we reached Ukrainian side, they would let us go and relieve oursel ves sometimes, but if we were passing a place that there were like bushes around, or Œ or trees, or [indecipherable]. But otherwise they were, you know, hurry, hurry, hurry, and th ey would bring Œ usually toward the end of the day, they would bring us in the pails, some kind of soup which was watery mixed vegetables, and ve ry hard, Russian bread, you know, like Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ you don™t want to be hit by it. It™s a kind of Œ but still, when you hungry Œ sometimes you could get it, a nd sometimes they didn™t get it, and so we were given that, and not every day. So the people wh o had some food, brought Œ like this lady might Œ might have been advi sed by these people to take some Œ some food to take Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 58on the train. So some people were lucky, or had been clear-minded, that they had Œ I remember my mother said th at she left the cooking of th e tripes from the previous day, because it™s a two days™ meal that you have to prepare, and I didn™t like it, as a child. Oh, good thing my mother didn™t take it, be cause I wouldn™t eat it. But that was at the beginning. And then afterwards , one woman had the can of tripes, and she opened it, and she gave it to the children, one spoon each. And it was so good. Until I reached Œ really, I reached America, when some of the Polish people having their parties, and they had the tripes and I could finally feel Œ and we had also one woman who was quite elderly. She must ha ve been in her 90s. She was alone, but she had a nurse taking care of her at Œ at home. She was a daughter of some man who lived in our apartment house, above Œ across from us, who was arrested by Œ because I Œ during these months, there were constant arrests, people taken to prisons, all that. As a matter of fact, on the Œ December eight, which is my birthday, we visited my uncle, who was retired ge neral, and my aunt was crying. Why? Because day before they arrested him and took him to prison. And as a matter of fact, he was also one of the victims, but of another Œ in Vicovnya (ph), which recently was opened up on the Russian, near Kiev, that it was the prisoners, who were not prisoners of war, but prisoners who were taken to full prisons. When the Œ Germany attacked Russia, Russians were in panic, an d were taking all trains and Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 59all the families, because they had moved the families back to Poland. And so they didn™t have enough room to take prisoners to Russia, and they would shoot the prisoners and throw them through the wi ndows of the Œ of the prison, and from what I know from eyewitnesses, that they were one level, or two levels high, dead bodies, the Russians killed some of the things. And I know that was Œ Brigitki was the name of the prison. And my uncle was in Brigitki, but I Œ of course, we didn™t know these things, because by then when Œ when Germany attacked Russia, we were already in Russia, in Kazakhstan , so we were too far, so we didn™t know what was happening. But anyway Œ Q: There was an old woman on the train who had a nurse Œ A: And her son was arrested, and many, many more people who were owners of land, who were rich shop owners, who were intelligence, or who were Œ Q: Intelligentsia, you mean. A: Intelligentsia was, of course, who Œ the enemies of the Soviet society. Q: Were there any Jewish people on the trains? A: Yes, there were Jewish people too, it™s Œ because Polish society, in a sense, was very much [indecipherable] about 10 percent of pole Œ Poles Œ Poland were the Polish Jews. In the eastern part of Poland , they were most in small shtetls. They were mostly Orthodox Hasidic Jews who did not assimilate. But they were mostly Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 60in Lvov, in the cities. Many people had great many friends, which wasn™t Œ depended, of course, on the individuals, but they were also the enemies of the societies, some lawyers, some doctors were taken into the camp. I didn™t Œ this woman, the banker™s wife was Jewish and Richard was Jewish. But that was somehow an Œ just occurred to me later on th at they must have been Jewish because of Œ for some reason, I don™t know what made me think about it, that Œ that I Œ somebody said that the father was Jewish, so I thought that the family was Jewish. But they were on the same Œ in the same truck, and there were some of them taken, although there was also a lot of these people like this, who were located in our apartment, who were waiting to go to Russia. Q: I see. A: Some free on the Œ you know, getting to Œ to the paradise Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ of Œ of, you know humanit y paradise, or whatever they call it. So some of the Jews, in great numbers, escaped to Russia and stayed throughout the war. Some of them returned to Poland after the war. But they were saying about hundreds of Œ hundreds of thousands of people who landed in Russia, but some of them landed as we did land Œ Q: That™s Œ they were deported. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 61A: Œ as Polish citizens. Q: Yes. A: As the Polish citizens. Q: I want to go back to when you were talking about hunger on the train, and a woman who opens the tripe can and give s children a Œ you mentioned something about an old woman Œ A: Yes. Q: Œ and we didn™t finish about Œ A: Oh yes, I™m sorry, yes. Q: That™s okay. A: And what I remember, she was already s-senile, and she kept on crying, water, water, water. She wanted a drink, and we di dn™t have too much of that luxury. And with her the situation was different because this woman was not her relative. But when the NKVD came to take her, they wouldn™t take her as a nurse. She said, I am her cousin. Then they took her on Œ that sh e swore that she is her cousin, to take care of this woman. So she went willingly Œ Q: Wow. A: Œ to take care of this woman. Q: Wow. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 62A: And she survived this three weeks of train. Three weeks of Œ there were Œ we were aware, but not in our wagon, people who died. So the Ru ssians threw them out while the trains were going. There were children who were born, and died, and Œ but not in our wagon. Q: Wagon. A: And then we arrived on the first of May at Zhangiztobe . We went through the Ural mountains, Omsk and Tomsk , and then Novosibirsk , if you know a map, from Novosibirsk, which in my eyes was beautifully lighted and was considered a showplace of Œ the Soviets were showing off, and we were not allowed, of course, to walk on the station. And stayed there for several hours, and then we went down to Semipalatinsk , which is entering the Kazakhstan . Q: Okay. A: And we came to Zhangiztobe , which is about 200 or maybe more miles after Semipalatinsk , but this is same part, Tinskaya (ph) Oblast (ph). And fro Œ we came there, and as the lorries from the previous transport, previous train came, and people were removed on the trucks, taken into th e distance, and were on the trucks. But when it came to our transport, they did not have any trucks left. So they waited for the Cossacks with the Œ with the carts, to be driven by oxen, and take us into the distance. And we were on these trucks for Œ I Œ I think around 10 days, or eight days Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 63and eight nights. And as a matter of fact, th is old lady, fell Œ the Œ that Œ the cart Œ when Œ one of the carts, when we were traveling, went through the river, there were no bridges, but the cart wheels broke on the river Œ within the river, and she fell into the river, with her things. People saved her, put her back on truck. She came later on to Œ to the place where they dropped us, and lived for another weeks, and died there. Not knowing Œ she was asking her nurse, did you Œ did you correspond with the hotel where we are going to stay? Because she didn™t know. She knew she was going somewhere. And did you know what is it, the name of the place where we are going? Because she Œ she Œ before the war, she traveled a lot, she was very Œ probably a fairly rich family, so she was thinking she is going for a ride. So imagine this woman, who took care of her, went with her. And when the woman died, she put in a small Œ a small cemetery, what they made at the time, in the Cossacks Œ mostly Cossack co llective farms. Q: Yeah. A: But that™s the kolkhoz. Q: Yeah. A: Russian collective farms are sovkhoz . Q: Yeah. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 64A: But collective farms kolkhoz belongs to the people who are Œ these were mostly Kazaks , Kazakhstan , and few elderly Russian families. And this woman, a younger woman, and Œ when the Œ like through the [indecipherable] so long ago I can™t Œ I wouldn™t recognize her, of course . She escaped from there, she almost got back to Poland , and she was caught, and she was bought bra Œ back. She was innocent, helping this woman, old woman. She escaped because she had actually Œ Q: She had done her job, yeah. A: Œ somehow sh Œ I Œ you kn ow, she Œ she should have be en too, she didn™t Œ she didn™t do anything against the Ru ssians, or e Œ but she wasn™t Œ Q: Well, nobody did. A: Nobody did. Q: Yeah. A: But you know, but being intelligentsia, or being the family of army Œ of army Œ of Œ or family of Œ of police, or intelligent, or in the jury Œ so you had Œ Q: In the court system, yeah. A: Right, the system was completely, you know, you belong to somebody, to who Œ just Œ Q: Yeah. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 65A: And she was a nurse, and not elderly, I wo uld say she must have been in her late 30s or 40s. And she escape by foot. Some how she got Œ she paid somebody truck Œ somebody on the Œ on the people Œ Cossacks wh o took her to the station. We were about 200 miles from this Zhangiztobe station from which they drove us. Q: Okay. So what happened then? Where did you land, what did you have to do? Did anybody by that point explain why you were there? A: No. No, there was no explanation. You don™t have the Œ you Œ you deal with the Œ with the unseen situation who accuses you of what, you don™t know. We didn™t feel guilty about anything. End of File One Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 66Beginning File Two A: Œ they dropped us into the public place, like a cover Œ not covadai Œ like a meeting place of that kolkhoz, a-and we had na Œ some people had the blankets, and they separated each other, we had the floor to sleep on, and there were no beds, nothing. And for privacy, among about, I don™t know, 25 or 30 families were left there. Some other people were taken into another kolkhoz . So we sa Œ Q: So you were on th is collective farm. A: Collect Œ some of kolkhoz Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ right. Second day, the minister Œ not the minister, president of kolkhoz , the Cossacks comes, you have to go to work, my mother. Didn™t say anything to me or my brothers, but you stay hom e, and your mother has to go to work. And they took women, whatever age they were, adult women, to work. It was making bricks by mixing the soil with Œ with some drippings from the cows, because this was a kolkhoz that was taking care of the cows. And the milk and butter was being sent to the Œ to the government, or to the whatever it was, but they had their portion to th Œ to give to the government. And if it was left anything, after the harvest, so a year of work, after the harvest you would ge t something if the harvest was Œ Q: Good. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 67A: Œ good. But we were free labor. I mean, we were slaves who came. We couldn™t get anything and we didn™t ha ve any savings of food or a nything by this three weeks of not Œ traveling on that train. So most of the things at Œ at first there was a ration and some Cossacki(ph) people who liked to trade in. For example, you could go and sell a blouse, or like my mother sold my nighty. I had pink nighty, and a white with some pink flowers. And for that we got a hen that was sitting on the eggs, 10 eggs, which was the best bargain we had because the eggs broke and we had small chicken. And so later on, my mother would take one of the chicken when it grew, to ask some Russian to kill that Œ Q: And then you™d have some food. A: Œ and we had some food. But otherwis e, there was no shops to buy any food. They Œ not even for the communists who were there, they probably had something Œ Q: So where did you keep the chicken? A: Well, outside is where the Œ we were, at first, living on the Œ in the small Œ they put us with the older Russian family, wh ere she had Œ she had one room, and we had another room. There was an entrance, an d on the other side of entrance was one cow, her old cow that wasn™t giving milk any more because it was old cow, and the yard. We lived in Œ Q: Oh, so you were moved from the central place where you slept on the floor Œ Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 68A: Right. Q: Œ into this one room. A: Well, this is like a village. Q: Yeah, got it. A: So in the village we were spread out among local people. Q: Okay. A: Mostly the Russian. The Cossacks kept to themselves, and they spoke Œ we didn™t speak Cossacks, and Œ and Œ Q: Right. A: They spoke the Mongolian. Q: Did your mother speak Russian? A: No. Not enough. That Œ that was one of the difficulties. Some people who had spoken Russian, and were enough, so somehow either met some Russian who said you could come here, maybe be a teacher or something, but it Œ this was too small a village for a very differentiated society. Q: Sure. A: So some people somehow, I don™t know how, met some Russian who would say well, why don™t you give like in case of our friends, with whom he still lives in Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 69Warsaw, I visit him. He was any Œ anyway, he Œ he was told to the woman, who spoke beautiful Russian because she was born in Saint Petersburg before the war. Q: Okay. A: And she was from quite a semi-aristoc ratic family, her language was beautiful. But then somehow this Œ by people who we re passing the Œ the place, or somehow, he said, give your son, he will be helping me with my farm. Because they Œ some people had the smaller Œ Q: Right. A: Œ or bigger farm. Small farms, which were also part of this, but a little bit outside. And so Œ and she herself was given a post in the county seat where she was working because she knew Russian. And thin k that were Œ saved him, and saved Œ so for few months, or I don™t know how long, they were in that co Œ in that village with us. But several people slowly were moving. They either let them go, or somebody Œ Q: So, with your mother, she was making th e bricks Œ you know, she was having to make those bricks. A: Right. Q: And you were alone with your brothers back at the house, back at the little room? Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 70A: Back bu Œ in the room, in the outside. It™s like in the village, open Œ Q: Did you do anything? Did you Œ did they send you to school? What happened? A: Well, it™s Œ when I was Œ by then I was 13 and a half. Q: Well, it sounds to me if you were doi ng Œ if you were born in 1926, and you™re deported in 1940 Œ A: Forty, so I was t Œ Q: Œ you must have been 13. A: Œ only 13. Q: Yeah, 13. A: And I became th-th Œ Q: Fourteen? A: Œ 13 and coming to 14 still. Q: Got it, mm-hm. A: And I was told that I can go and be a shepherdess for calves, because the policy of that village was that the cows were separated from the Œ the young ones, because they would not drink milk. Milk was necessary as a selling thing for the government. So the calves had to go somewhere else on the Œ to eat grass, to be sent out, to be shepherded. And we Œ when we arrived, as you might know, Kazakhstan in that place is steppe. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 71Q: Yeah. A: Miles and miles and miles of steppe [indecipherable] special places. So we would take about a hundred cows. At fi rst I was one, and there was another Œ another boy, bigger, and actually there was this boy who went to Œ to the other Œ was taken by this man from here. Q: Right, right, mm-hm. A: Private work. And then was my brother, at one point. And we would take, at five o™clock in the morning, and push this Œ these animals, and somehow we managed. We Œ we slept sometimes in the [indecipherable] then Œ then around noontime, they would lie down and chew like, you kno w, the normal things after the eating, they Œ Q: Right. A: Œ have to chew. And sometimes when it was hot, or it was terrible for us, incidents, there were. One of them, they said they Œ they got a Œ a bite of a special fly. And then, if it was an Œ like a leader of this group, of this hundred, there were several big Œ bigger cows, and several small cows. He would raise his tail and start running. Q: So if it got bit by this fly, then it runs, and then everything fol Œ everyone follows? Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 72A: Anyone follows. And we were told we were allo Œ allowed Œ permitted to let them go through the fields where they had some wheat, or where they had corn, because they would damage it. So when they run, we run, and then we had to gather them again. I remember that was Œ kind of things. I remember when I was reading the book I got somewhere from package, because packages could come at that time, from Lvov. I got some package, or somebody lent me a book, and I come back from this running, rounding them up, back to the place where we are supposed to stay, and got eating Œ started eating the book. And then, I am trying to catch him, and I run and he keeps running. Q: He wants to learn to read. A: Exactly. To swallow. Q: To swallow. A: Anyway, these were first. Then my mother had different job, doing keezhak(ph). Did you heard of word keezhak (ph)? Since it is the steppes, there are no woods. You cannot buy any wood to burn, and the Œ and of course, there™s no coal. Q: Yeah. A: The burning Œ the material for burning was the old drippings of the cows, that you mix with straw and water. And they have big puddles, like this room, or even Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 73bigger, where the women were wal-walkin g around with their legs, mixing it up. Keezhaks(ph). For the people who were running the kolkhoz . Q: So that means it wa s the fuel to heat? A: Yes. Q: That™s what it became? A: You could not Œ or, of course you could not participate in this local thing for the government, but what we did, we would go, and Œ and wh en we were walking with our calves, we saw where the cows went. The cows were usually very much further. By the times we would pass, it was dry so we were picking dry Œ Q: Dung. A: Œ drippings. Q: Yeah, mm-hm. A: Dung. Q: Yeah. A: And bringing them. And you could put it as Œ on this Œ in the, not oven, but in the Œ in the kitchen, in the fireplace. And under Œ you know, they had Œ Q: And it could heat a little bit. A: Little heat from that, that was the only thing. Because otherwise the Œ the bush, that was very prickly bush that la Œ Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 74Q: Yeah. A: Œ grows in the steppe, is very difficult to really burn for long Œ it Œ it™s just like a Œ a eagle Œ the needle trees that Œ Q: Right. A: Œ have needles. They just jump Œ Q: Right. A: Œ into fire, and quickly die. So the ot her things what you had to find have, you know, piles of these, and that you fed that. And my mother was doing Œ Q: Oh my gosh. A: Œ with Œ with the other ladies, mum Œ one of the thing that was funny wa Œ from that, with my mother was funny, they were talking about the recipes for cakes. Q: As they™re pounding this dung. A: On the Œ how to take your mind off you r job. So this was one job. There was another one where there was a big dug up well for the cows were Œ were close Œ some Œ some places where my mother was taken with some other women, to clean this well, because the Œ it was dug in the soil, it was not a real well, it was just a spot where they kept water. But when the cows were walking down, they were pushing this soil in, so it had a lot of sedi ment. So my mother was one of those who were standing up to the waist in the water, getting by pails the sediment, pushing to Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 75another woman who was taking the sediment , to have a clear water for cows to drink. Q: Oh my gosh. A: Then during the harvest, when the Œ that was a year later, and ow Œ the winter, the Œ the snow that was two meters high, that was constant, constant snow falling and cold weather, except that it was dry climate, so you didn™t feel that much of the cold, as much as there was a lot of snow. The only thing, the Buran that came Œ Buran was the name of the wind, special wi nter wind that brought the snow. You couldn™t see Œ almost you coul dn™t see your hand, it was so thick. But also, because if you walked out, you got lost. So the peop le, to get Œ to go into real well, that was in the middle of the Œ you kn ow, a group of houses, had to tie themselves by rope to go it Œ and to come back. Ot herwise they would not Œ Q: They™d get lost. A: Œ get back. Q: Yeah. A: That was winter. But then there was spri ng, and there was the harvest. And in the harvest my mother was work ing with the big combine. I don™t know whether that™s a word in English. Q: Yeah. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 76A: The big complicated things, with they sort the wheat from the chaff, and things, and my mother was working somehow. Sh e developed a cold Œ cough, constant cough. From what I can guess, that at that time, she covered her face with the napkin, but the napkin was full of the small pieces of wheat. Q: Right. A: That probably got into her lungs there forever afterwards Œ Q: She coughed. A: Œ probably, she was coughing. But that Œ that wa-wa Œ was her work. And it Œ Q: But her p Œ your poor moth er, I mean, to imagine that she loses her husband, she has to take care of three children, she doesn™t know where her husband is. She had never worked in such ways before. A: Right. The woman could not understand . Like she had to paint Œ some of the houses you painted by maki ng straw with some soil, with some dung also Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ and you painted with your hands. All the floors were the dirt floors, there was no wooden floors. And they would say, wh at kind of a housewife you were when you don™t know how to put the floor, the things? Like, this was somehow ridiculous, but this is what you said, how sensitive you are. When I Œ during Œ when I wrote the book Œ helped Allen Paul write the book, there was some presentation Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 77of the book, and he asked Œ and he Œ there is story of my family and other two or three families, more detailed. And he, Allen Paul, asked us to speak. We were in Washington , and several senators came, and Po lish, you know, consulate Œ consul and officials listened for it, and so I was started saying how we were taken to Russia and that. And then at one point, I said, I have to stop here, suddenly, and stopped this, what I™m talking about, and turn to real heroes of this thing. Imag Œ now that I am a mother, because back then, it was in 1990 something, I already had five children. Now that I am a mother, I can understand the tragedy of a mother who is Œ doesn™t know where her Œ food fo r her children comes, where she could exchange something for some food. You could, for a blouse you could get three potatoes, or some Œ toward the end, the Russians themselves we re hungry, so they would give us a first chaff of wheat. So we burned the chaff on top of the stove that was iron, and put in the water, so the water had the taste, and that was our soup that we ate. And these things happened, and I Œ I didn™t say exactly at that time, but I mean, this was a woman who, as you sa y, lost her husband, taken to unknown country, thrown into un Œ inhuman cond itions, and sees her children crying of hunger. Q: And what to do? A: And what to do? And not knowing what happened to her husband. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 78Q: Yeah. A: So that the Œ this were us Œ really the heroes for all Œ children did not Œ fortunately did not realize how hard things were, how the world is not made of nice stories that you are used to, but situations are different. So children somehow are more Œ somehow get accustomed to take the best of what situation is, and Œ Q: That™s one of the things that helps kids survive. A: Right. Q: I want to pause just for a second. [technical discussion] Okay, we™re rolling. So the harvest ends Œ A: The harvest ends. The local people who belong to that kolkhoz get their parts, what they earned, according to some Œ their judgments. But we, of course, don™t get anything, except that during the year they would give us milk, which was taken Œ cream, they would take off the milk the Œ how you call it, the plain Œ Q: Right. A: Œ milk, because that you could not hold until harvest, so to speak. Q: Well, this is what I wanted to ask you, whether or not the milk that the cows gave you ever got any of it. So, you were allowed to have some milk from the cows. A: When we came home Œ Q: Okay. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 79A: Œ we would get some m ilk to take to our home. Q: Okay. A: That was the Œ I don™t know how much it was. I remember that I tried once to get milk from that old cow, and nothing came . Had Œ anyway, the winter started, and they said that the Œ because the harvest was not really poor, but they would somehow let the horsed Œ the horses who we re waiting with the carts to take the wheat to the magazines in the big cities, or wherever they were taking, eat the wheat while waiting. So what was left, they still had to put the taxed amount to the government, and what was left, so very Œ I think they brought it on themselves to a certain degree, that they didn™t have too much to share. And then they told my mother they would not have work during the winter for women, and during the spring. So they ordered my mother to go to the county hou Œ hun Œ county place, which was about 25 or ma ybe 30 miles away, into Kokpekti , which is like Hackensack here, or whatever, and Œ to find a job. They allowed her to take my younger brother, but they kept my brother Œ older brother and my self as the kind of security that my mother will not run away. Q: Well, this is something that I wanted to ask now. When you were in this place, I don™t hear anything about guard s, I don™t hear anything ab out jailers, or any kind of authorities, or any Œ Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 80A: Is a Œ they called it free prison. You could not leave that place. For example, the post office was in the next village, bigger kolkhoz . Q: Yeah. A: To go there, if we wou Œ at the beginning were getting some letters or packages from Lvov, because the rush Œ the Œ Germany did not start yet the war. And we had something, they would let us know that there is a letter waiting. And to go for it, my mother had to walk several miles, or get some Œ some kind Cossack would take him Œ her on the truck Œ on the truck, on the cart, and take her to that Œ or sometimes she was Œ she had to ask the permission, written. And I even have here some Œ Q: Of her letter Œ of her permission list Œ A: She wrote on the piece Œ on the Œ with the pencil Œ Q: Right. A: Œ written you Œ I can still read it, there™s a kind of permission that my mother can go to the village to Œ to the post office, and come back. Q: Okay. A: And one day my mother was so afraid because the predsedatel, that™s pres Œ political president of what was Russian, and ultra, ultra-communist ga Œ was away, and my mother couldn™t get the permit to go out. And so she went without a permit, Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 81and she was coming back, carrying a package which was I don™t know how many, maybe 10 pounds or something. Was very tir ed, but she was more afraid than Œ than tired, but Œ because if they catch her, and they would take her to prison, what will happen to us? And she said, she had lived it, several miles that she had to walk, with such trepidation Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ that she might be caught, and that she somehow let us down, that she would be taken to prison. But fortunately, so mething like that did not happen. Q: But the fear was in her, the price was in her. A: Yeah, you can imagine, because Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ she knew like Œ and y-you know, the Œ the places outside this town, the roads were probably cart driven roads, and not the regular highways or whatever. Q: Yeah. A: It was all empty steppes. You could go by train, and s Œ hours and days, and it was all empty. So somehow you didn™t Œ even if you tried to move somewhere, where would you go? Q: Yeah. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 82A: So my mother was sent to that town, and she st Œ that was sometime toward the beginning of winter, so probably they took us from this place where this old woman gave us a piece of Œ to stay with Œ corner of the Œ of her up Œ house, and put us in an empty house that didn™t have wi ndow, had only paper on the Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ wall, and the Œ it was so cold, we didn ™t have any burning things by then. In the winter we couldn™t go behind the house Œ Q: Of course. A: Œ and get anything to heat. So we slept in our coats. Q: Yeah. A: And in the morning, the water that we kept to wash down, was all solid ice. But they Œ then my mother started Œ got the job as a janitor in some children™s home [indecipherable] hou-house, and Œ Q: An orphanage. A: Orphanage, or also the Œ sometimes they took the children probably from Œ from streets, or something. Anyway, she got the job, she was writing to this, let me have my children. And this predsedatel said no, we have too few horses, and they™re needed here to shove the snow, or whatever, work a little bit in farm, and I can Œ we™ll Œ well, no. No, no, no, until late March. And there was something else that Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 83happened, that somehow it was almost, you know, for the normal situation in life, difficult to understand or feel, or react to. We had the [indecipherable] among these women who stayed first, who came, there were two women: one was with the small child, the other was with Œ alone, a fa irly well-educated. She was, I think, a nurse, or some advanced, super nurse. And she had a lo Œ she wa s lucky to get a lot of jewelry. And she was also getting the jewelry from this woman and the other one would hire the Cossacks with the cart, to take them to a distant cit Œ town. Not city, a town, where they had so-called zwartaz(ph) kupka(ph). Q: What™s that? A: Selling the gold that the government wanted. So they would take the things, and then you could buy Œ they had cans of food. So I know my mother gave her wedding ring, and some Œ bracelet, I think. And that was all, she didn™t have much on her. But anyway, these women, after several months, not working Œ not going like my mother was going to work at the farm Œ were accused by this predsedatel that they were parasite [indecipherable] Q: That they were speculeg Œ speculating. A: Speculating, and they are not working. In Russia, if you don™t work, you don™t eat. That™s the Russian. [speaks Russian] Q: [Speaks Russian] Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 84A: Yeah, and so they were arrested, they were parasite, because they were living Œ oh, first they sold their things, and then they would buy from some Œ Q: Right. A: Œ women who had something, like my mo ther gave her ring, and they would go and bring some food, or maybe Œ I don™t re member if we got an Œ what we got for that wedding ring, but anyway, these women were arrested while my Œ and were kept in the prison in that town where my mother was now, with my younger brother. And the Polish people who lived arou nd there learned that there is going to be a judgment on them, they were going to be sentenced for whatever. And my mother tells me the story because they were watching this thing carefully. The women were given seven years of hard labo r in gulag, each. And they came out of the courtroom, and there stood this predsedatel, so thinking, you know, here I am a hero, defending the Soviet society from thes e parasites. Here you Œ you have proof that I was right. And somebody asked in Ru ssian, asked these women, what do you think about now, about the predsedatel, the situation and the predsedatel ? She said well, God is not speedy, but he is just. And this man, you kn ow, did Œ before, he was laughing at us when he saw a pray ing book, or some people praying or something, singing a religious song, he wa s laughing that there is no God, and all this kind of thing what the Œ he was ta ught. And so he returned home. Two weeks, Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 85or maybe three weeks, this is past hard winter, it™s already now into spring, but it™s still winter, it might be February, or so. He Œ his child gets the measles. His beloved older son, 10 years old or something, eigh t or 10 years old. And the measles doesn™t come to forward, but open, you know, breaks out inside the system, and the child dies. And this man turns himself into comp letely different man. He remembers what this person said, that God is not really speedy in punishing, or whatever, but he is just. And he looked at it as God™s warning, or something, and he started going to the Poles to ask about God, who is God, what do you believe , and something. And then one day, in the evening, toward the end of March, he came to us, that™s room with already was little bit warmer, but still Œ we were still not quite [indecipherable] Q: You were cold, yeah. A: Œ right. He said, gather up whatever you have, and I™ll come at night and take my horse and take you to your mother. And he drove me and my brother, with all the belongings that was with us, by night, to Kokpekti , to that city where my mother was working. Q: Oh my goodness. A: And this was on Œ on Œ you Œ you Œ you could not explain. In the normal circumstances you don™t have it. But this was something like Œ like the, you know Œ Q: It™s almost like a Œ Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 86A: Œ protection. Q: It™s almost like a biblical tale. A: Right. Q: Yeah. A: Y-Y-You cannot assume, but we had Œ my mother always prayed, we had, every evening before, we had always knelt down a nd said our prayers, and my mother was Œ she was not, I would say devote Œ devo ut, but she was religious enough, and she had the hope that God will not let us down. Which I think now, talking about the hope, I think the hope is the most important thing. Love is not only the thing that keeps you alive, hope is the thing that keeps you alive. Because you hope tomorrow will be better, tomorrow will be better. Can™t be any worse, tomorrow will be better. Love sometimes could not sa ve you, but hope could sa ve you because you went through very difficult moments, you were hungry, and maybe tomorrow somebody will give you a piece bread. I would go babysitting sometimes, to the Cossacks families. The child was in a small Œ I don™ t know how you call it, it was almost like a Œ like a basket near the roof. The baby was there, and if the baby cried, you pulled the string, and he dropped a little bit [indecipherable] stop. The parents were there having friends eating, and having their corner, laughing, or whatever, in Cossack™s la-language. But then afterwards, when I was going home, I would get a piece of Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 87bread, or actually a Œ sometimes it was in the Russian families, the Russians had bread. But the Cossacks had kind of like pita bread, because they had baked them. And they would give me one, and I would come home, wouldn™t eat there, come, divide it into four pieces, and then like, the animals who are hungry Œ if you see the animals who are hungry, each one takes a piece of big things, and goes to a small corner and eats by himself. And this is such an intuitive feeling, that we did the same thing. To take a small, one quarter of this piece, and go, and by crumbs eating, prolonging it, and eating. And it was somehow so neither Œ you know, the nature of Œ of Œ Q: Of people. A: Right. Q: How Œ how did things pr ogress? Somehow now, have you Œ in what you™re describing, has more than a year gone by Œ A: Yes. Q: Œ has it been a year and a half? How long were you in this place? A: In Kokpekti ? Q: Yeah. A: We were there Œ this is March would Œ we came. The spring Œ Q: March 1941? Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 88A: March 1941. Q: Okay. A: And then there is Œ my mother worked at that pl ace, and I think there was sometimes some Russian food that you could get, I think. And still, the exchange of things, or services, like we were Œ my brother and myself considered ourselves professional shepherds. So we Œ because this was a town, it was not the farm, but many of the women had the cows, one co w in some side of the houses or something. And we went around and if they had the calf, we said, we will set a small herd of cows, and we will go into the steppes Œ because it doesn™t belong to anybody, we could do it, and take it Œ but somehow we did Œ it fell through, but anyway, my brother was taken by Œ he wa s then 12 years old, and he was taken by the Œ some Russian people who were building the train things to Œ to go and be Œ you know, go-getter, or some Œ how do you call it? Help out with the small duties Œ Q: A gopher. A gopher. A: A Œ a gopher for Œ for these people, so he would go for a week, or sometimes longer. And wa Œ the Œ the younger brother stayed with us, and my mother Œ my mother was working. I-I Œ it Œ it seemed also a lot of Œ there were other Polish, many more Polish families, so we sometimes would gather aand, you know, had evenings like telling stories, or singing together, or sometimes gathering together. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 89But otherwise I don™t remember. I didn™t wo rk there. The only good thing was also very unusual thing, some stri Œ sort of diffi cult to pr Œ assume that it happens. When we were going from door to door, about our ad Œ possibilities of being hired, and we s Œ entered some very elegant buildings by there Œ of Œ there were office buildings and elegant people were walking, then we were Œ in a sense, we could walk wherever we wanted. We were not, you know, watched out, that you couldn™t go there, or couldn™t go there, just walk. And we knocked, thinki ng that we would find somebody. As it happened, a door opened, very elegant, intelligent man Œ what happened, engineer, who was working on th ese trains, or some other big jobs, and he™s one of the head persons. And he couldn™t give us a calf to [indecipherable] Q: Right. A: Œ but he started asking us Œ first of all, the Russians, of course, did not know about these people, you know, we were looked at no Œ you know how in Œ in Russia you don™t ask questions, first of all. So if they drop a group of people, so the Cossacks don™t si Œ first of all, don™t speak Russian, and they don™t know much about the outside world. They don™t know about the war, they don™t know what happened. So he started aski ng how come you found your self here? You are Polish, and started asking us question. He gave us some candy, a nd he said Œ he send us, later on, send us some bread or someth ing, to my mother. And for months Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 90afterward, from time to time Œ and for example, there were some passing engineers, through the town. So he would send them to my mother so she could make a cof Œ tea, or set Œ tea was the only thing that we Œ brick tea. You Œ I don™t know whether you would realize. It was a presse d tea by bricks, and it was more Œ Q: Concentrated? A: It™s a concentrated Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ leaves, pressed together like hard leave. And they were very valued, especially by Cossacks. Q: Okay. A: They would take a small Œ Q: Piece. A: Œ break an small, put in the water. And take it Œ after they drink water, they put it in the next one because it was so tight. Anyway, a Œ so when he would send us something, he Œ somebody who was passing by, to ask for tea, to ask my mother to make tea, also giving a chance that maybe we have something that can sell. I remember my moth Œ my father™s attaché Œ Q: Case. A: Œ case, my mother sold to one of these people. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 91Q: Engineers, yeah. A: And I don™t know whether it was some money, but there were some shops, although they had the shops, once a mont hs, the sugar would come. Once a month, salt would come. And the restaurant was al ways surrounded by the local people. If they killed a camel, or, you know, th-they didn™t have really killing the cows, because that was not th-the Œ in that city, I don™t know what actually was trading, in that sense. Q: Right. A: But you couldn™t get, sometimes, to th at restaurant, or Œ the woman who had Œ one of these two woman that had the gold, that was selling, she was sending her son to beg when Russians were eating. So he would go around and beg for Œ for food. We Œ I know that we didn™t Œ my brother and Œ and I did not feel like doing it, but that I remember, that that was the only way to get some food. And so this man was helping us, from time to time sending some o Œ fish, or something like Œ like that. And always asking us to come and tell him how we are. My mother was, at one point very sick. She had heart problem, and she had kidney problem, whatever. And the doctor told us that she cannot drink too much water, because of the heart, to have not too much water for Œ so the lungs would not fill with water. But then we would get this chaff of wheat from somebod y for doing something for that woman, Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 92or selling something small. I really Œ sometimes the packages yet Œ packages are still coming. They would send us ri ce, they would send us fat, the Œ Q: Lard. A: Œ lard. Which was very much appreciated by Russians. Cossacks Œ Q: Not so much. A: Œ they™re Mohammedans. Q: Yeah. A: They would not look at it. But you coul d sell these things that came. And that, somehow, from day to day we, still hoping that it will be Œ then Œ and then Œ then it Œ one day, at the beginning of June, I re member the sun that was settling in the evening. I stood outside with some women Œ Russians, around. And they looked at sun, who was a red color, and she said, it™s bloody. It was blood. The war is coming. The war Œ they had some feeling about some kind of Œ Q: Disaster, yeah. A: Œ saying that it is Œ when the sun is like blood Œ looks Œ there is a war coming. This is beginning of 1941 Œ Q: June. A: Œ June. The 22nd June, the Russians are attacked by Germans. Q: Did your lives change? Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 93A: Not at the beginning. We didn™t kn ow what was going on. We were, you know, behind all the clouds and ev erything, we didn™t know. We didn™t get any letters, and Œ letters stopped, the packages stopped. Bu t also, no Œ no radios, nothing. But as Œ as things started to progress, we learned, toward the end of Œ of summer, I think it was sometimes late August or September, th at there was a kind of a conference with Russians and Œ and Poles, and Englis h people. English offered to help Russia to fight Hitler, but on the condition that the Poles who were allies of England had to go free. So they gave an amnesty. Not a ll of them followed this. The prison guards didn™t read, or didn™t Œ didn™t Œ or Œ ma ny people stayed there for years afterward. But some of them stayed, a nd there was an idea with Sikorski , who was the president Œ Q: Right. A: Œ of Œ of Poland , prime minister of Poland , together with General Anders, who was then also in prison, but he was let out. He was in prison in Lubyanka in Moscow. He was first Œ he was hev Œ badl y wounded, but he survived, and he became by Œ Sikorski ordered him to form the Polish army. At first it was thought to go with the Red Army, and the Russians, with some diplomatic talks, started talking and there Œ by then, the war is really going bad for Russians, because Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 94Moscow Œ people Œ government, Ru ssian government goes to Kuybyshev because Moscow is Œ Q: Right. Is being und Œ attacked. A: Œ is surrounded. Q: Yeah. A: And all the thing, and then Stalingrad starts. So at that time, Hitler is a lit Œ not Hitler, Stalin is a little bit pressed to the wall, and he agrees to allow Poles to form the government. There were couple of depos, where they put near Kuybyshev the [indecipherable] and Otwock or something like that, where the Poles started coming. They allowed [indecipherable] somewhere bet Œ duri ng the Œ into the prisons, into some towns where there was some more connection, in between, some people passed the information. And we are still in Kokpekti in the Œ and we were allowed to go somewhere where it™s not so co ld in the winter. So we don™t have to ask any permission if we want to go, but it still took some time, that by about November that year, we™re Œ this man, this engineer said, I will lend you my truck, to take you to the station, and then you can go south, wherever that Œ you know Œ Q: Right. A: Œ settle somewhere. Because we were not at age that Œ my brothers were too young to go, my mother wasn™t Œ would not be a soldier Œ Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 95Q: Sure. A: Œ whatever. Q: But you were allowed to be free. A: But we went to let Œ to go and maybe look for better living conditions, so Œ and this man lend us a car Œ the truck Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ to take us to [indecipherable] for nothing. Didn™t charge us for anything. And we waited for the trains. In Russia the trains means the train Œ you know, the cattle train, open or like wagons, that we were coming in. So when the trains like, would come, you would sit in the train, there is only one track going south, so it goes anywhere, track, and then my mother, being bourgeois brought Œ she went to buy tickets. He had Œ he gave us some money to buy tickets, so my mother paid to Alma-Ata. And as you know, Alma-Ata , when we came to Alma-Ata , they would not let us get off the station, because they said this is Œ this is a showplace of Kazakhstan . Alma-Ata means apple Œ father of the apples Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ or something like that. And it is a Œ a beautiful middle-terranean climate, like in Greece, or like in Italy. And we thought, you know, we will still carry our life, whatever it is, but in that place they wouldn™t let us in. So my mother said, how Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 96much wa Œ are the tickets, I have to buy tic kets. I Œ I cannot get on the train without the tickets. So she had 80 rubles left, so how far this would allow, and that would take us to Jambul, which is a big city down Œ Q: South. A: Œ in Œ south. It™s an industrial city, and it™s antique city, it was one on the road, silk road, and all that. Anyway, we went Œ we got back on the train, went also on the train, took us. In Jambul we stayed out, we were put out on then, and you couldn™t get into the city in a sense, to walk around, unless you had to prove that you have work in the city, and a place to liv e. If you have to look for work, the first question is, do you live here? If you don™t live, you couldn™t Œ you couldn™t get the hou Œ it™s a Œ Q: It™s a Œ it™s a Œ it™s a closed circle. A: Right. So my mother was very upset. At one point she got a Œ how you call it Œ how you call th Œ the Russian banya(ph), you know, a Œ Q: Mm-hm, oh, a bath. A: Bath. She had the room Œ on e Œ one couple said, why have banya(ph) and we don™t take with my wife, we don™t take the bath, it™s outside, you know. So there is room Œ but there is room only for you and the two boys. And I was living Œ there were already several Poles around, and they were somehow Œ some contacts were Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 97among the Poles, that they, I don™t know, by luck would get in somebody that we knew before, from the northern part. Q: Can we interrupt just for a second? I think you need Œ [technical break] Okay, so you™re in Jambul, right? A: We have Œ on the station in Jambul. Q: Yeah. A: And my mother finds that banya(ph), the ba-bathhouse, not Œ Q: So, a sauna? A kind of like a sauna? A: A sauna Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ outside, with the pile of stones. Q: How do you say it in Polish? A: Banya(ph). Q: Oh, banya(ph). A: That™s local, because we don™t have it. Q: Okay. A: You know, when the Russians came to Lvov, we didn™t have the lice-ing places, so we were not cultural enough, considered by Œ by the Russians. Banya (ph) is typically Russian or Scandinavian, but act ually more Russian, you have the small Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 98building like a garage, a stone, big stones, and in the middle it™s a heavy pot that you put water, and you fire the Œ under the stones, and the stones become so hot, and the water boils, and the steam Œ Q: Steam, yeah. A: And you had sometimes they use the kind of sticks Œ Q: To beat you, yeah. A: Œ to beat you. And anyway, I didn™t have the pla Œ place for me, and I was Œ for a couple of weeks. So my mother had the chance to Œ had a chance to put a foot in Jambul . But then after a few weeks, or Œ I think it was few weeks or two months or something, his family was coming in, and he said he will be using banya (ph), and so out you go. And my mother was walki ng Œ it™s another story of unusual things. My mother was walking on the street, and she seemed like some Œ some woman was passing her, a beautiful, fairly young wo m Œ I think she must have been in her early 30s or something. And she comes to my mother, said, what is the matter, you look so Œ like something very bad happened. And said she now lost the place here, so she can™t go and look for job, and she doesn™t know where to go. They would not let my mother stay Œ us to stay Œ Q: Right. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 99A: Œ in Jambul . And my mother said she™s a Œ she will be looking for the apartment, and she™s Œ but I don™t know where to start. So she said, come to me tomorrow here. And she lived not too far from that place where banya(ph) was, on that street. It™s a Œ it™s a big city, but it™s not quite paved yet, the dirt is on the street, and especially in the rainy days, you go up to half legs that sank in the mud. But anyway, she showed where she lived, and who Œ and actually, she invited my mother to come and have cup of tea with her, and tell her the story. She said, come to me tomorrow. And my mother came Œ went to the station where we are sa Œ lying on our pieces of luggage, whatever it was, and she said, tomo rrow I am going to Œ she said she will look for Œ among her friends, maybe somebody has something to offer. And as it happened, she said yes, here, go to that place, and my mother knew a little bit of Russian, so she could converse.

Q: Being Œ yeah. A: Œ hanging over you. Anyway, so we moved in to that place, we made friends with this woman, sometimes had Œ she had us for tea, sometimes she Œ she came over to our room. We sometimes helped her with some other Poles who couldn™t find places, so we subletted a piece of the room. And th at is 1941 Œ or 40 Œ no Œ Q: Forty-two. A: This is ™42. This is November we left Kokpekti, we came in the winter, which in Jambul was a muddy Œ Q: Yes. A: Œ rainy winter. And then my mother found a job in homework, making the quilts.

Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 102A: You know, so my mother had the right to stay in Jambul , and had the place to stay in Jambul. Then we learned that this army that was Polish army made of prisoners and Œ Q: Right. A: Œ ex-prisoners and people who came cl ose, because the Russians would not give them tents. Only in the winter they were at the regular tents without any heating, and any clothing and the food, suppo Œ there were a hundred thousand people, practically Œ not Œ not hundred thousand, but at least Œ th ey gave the food only for 40,000 people, so the people were Œ Q: Hungry. A: Œ really starving there. Q: Yeah. A: So the Russian suggested, you go south, and Sikorski , and Œ and ish Œ and Sikorski and the Russian Œ not the Russian, En glish forces, suggested that you go southern part of Russia, and then get out into the Middle East under the British jurisdiction. So that happened, and these pe ople went there. We still did not have the right of it, and I did not know where is my father, because only the families of the military people who were going there, had the chance to go as families of the people or Œ in Œ in the army. And every da y then, from Œ I started working, I had to Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 103work, because I was then 15 in January, alt hough my December date doesn™t count, I am 16 from the first of January, even though the whole month I™m not yet 16. I had to work in the butink Œ you know what butinki are, the Œ Q: The Œ these are Œ A: Œ pressed Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ pressed shoes from wool Œ pressed wool Œ Q: Yes. A: Œ that you roll. I was in factory of th is, so cleaning the wool cut off the sheep, and then separated, they would take it in another room to wash it, and then they would take it on the combs, and sewing and a ll that kind of thing. That was not part of my job, my job was only this, exce pt that it was full of this prickly Œ Q: Yeah, hurts your fingers. A: Œ things, right. So my hands were always in pain, because it™s all dirty, prickly wool, straight from the lambs. But anyway, I worked, and at one point th-the Œ it went bankrupt. Can you imagine in Russia, it goes bankrupt? How™d Œ it™s Œ the money in Russia goes from one pocket to another pocket. It™s not that some owns it Œ somebody owns it Œ Q: That™s right. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 104A: Œ some Œ probably some Œ some people made some bad things, and they kicked him out, and so the factory Œ Q: Closed. A: Œ folded. But then, this is now coming to the summer, and the more and more we Œ people were passing by, and some of the trains, the cattle trains full of the prisoners are passing by, and because Jambul was quite a big station, and also the war is going on, so the trucks are needed for soldiers, so these trains are staying, sometimes for a few days, and I would go and look for my father among the thousands of people who are passing, and as king Œ and some people said, oh yes, I knew him. So somehow I would give them something to eat I brought myself. You know, these people were hungry. Q: Hungry. A: And you know, they Œ whatever you call Œ their cloth was in pieces. They sem Œ they themselves were, you know, like the remnants of human beings, after two and a half Œ Q: And this was Anders™s army? A: Hm? Q: These were prisoners, or Anders™s army?

A: So they™re still prisoners actually, but free, going to join Yangiyo™l which is near Tashkent, near Samarkand, where the Polish forces were forming, before they were to go to Persia and Iraq. Persia , it™s Iran . Q: Right. A: At that time, shah was still there. And anyway, this is still Œ I cannot predict what will happen, but I™m looking for my fa ther so he can go and join the army Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ and put us on the list as his relative, so we can come also, to get out of Œ Q: Sure. A: And I Œ I remember couple Œ couple of Œ there is towa rd the end of some on Œ or beginning of August. And they are talking about end of August, army is going to go over the Caspian Sea, too. And I Œ I™m very upset, not finding my father, and passing by Œ by the passengers train station on the Œ on one of the [indecipherable] of the sides, there stays a group of Polish uniformed officers. And I pass by, not to ask them anything, but just Œ just to Œ maybe something, you know, I don™t know Œ Q: You will hear something. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 106A: I will hear something. And so, it just happened that one is introducing another one. This is Capitan Organish (ph) Koppage (ph), this is true, Organish(ph) Koppage (ph), he is the officer in charge of the list of civilians who go Œ goes now to Yangiyo™l, and in few days the list will be closed, because toward the end of August, the people are starting to leave the Œ Russia. All the army is going out. When I Œ my heart sunk. By now, I didn™ t find my father. I came home very sad looking, and my mother somehow gained my tale of what happened. And she said Organish(ph) Koppage(ph)? Did he look like that? And she describes me this man, because I looked very closely at him. Was round face , he had red blonde hair, cut very short. And he had the eyeglasses, but the ones that hold by the nose. Q: Mm-hm, pince-nez, mm-hm. A: And reddish face, you know, kind of Œ they call it in Œ in Polish the piggy Œ like Œ like pig has the color of the hair, and al most like albino type of thing. And my mother, yes this ca Œ this is Capitan Koppage(ph), who was a friend of your father, but you were very small when he was tr ansferred to another town or city, or whatever, in his duties, so you can™t remember him. But he liked you very much, he would hum and Œ and my mother sat down and wrote several letters to Yangiyo™l. Q: Okay. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 107A: And fortunately for the post office, it reached him a couple of hours before closing the list, and they put us as Œ my mother as his sister, and we got on the list. Q: Oh my God. Oh my God. A: This is Œ this is one of those unusual things that, you know, my mother is on the list now. But next transport is from Ugovoy(ph), which is about 180 kilometers before Jambul, so we have to go back on the trai n, or however we could get to jam Œ Q: This place. A: Œ to Œ to that place with the trains that have the transport of these people to go out. From that train, go to cor Œ Caspian Sea, to Krasnovodsk, and you get on this Œ with all the transport, th-the people are on the list, can get it. The thing wa Œ which was also difficult for us to Œ to do, it Œ not only that we didn™t have money to pay for any kind of transport, but the city of Jambul was put Œ Poles in the city of Jambul were put under martial law Œ not martial law, arrested, so to speak. We could not leave Jambul legally because there was some Œ some difficulties with the police delegatura . Q: Okay. A: Delegatura was, you Œ you understand, the office of the Polish government, and the emb-embassy in Œ in Kuybyshev, in Œ and London representative. They did Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 108something, they had black market, they were getting the transport of goods from rush Œ from America: people were sending clothing, and Œ Q: Yes. A: Œ for this Œ for the Œ this big center. Jambul was really an Œ almost a Œ a big center where they would bring some thi ngs. And I understand that some of the people Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ la Œ different people, all nations ha ve those people that they would somehow sold some of the things on the bl ack market. So th e Poles were non Œ Q: Persona non grata. A: Right. So how we can get out? My mother remembered that we had a painting of one of our Polish friend. She was the wife of the judge in Poland , oh, he was a lawyer before the war, and high, high up. And he was called to Kuybyshev to go to Russia quickly, almost like day to day, to go to be in the government on Œ on Œ on the [indecipherable] or something. And she didn™t ha ve a time to give a painting of the portrait Œ she was herself a painter Œ to the owner of a store. And my mother said, I am sure she Œ that store has a truck. Maybe I™ll give Œ she wakes up one day, and she Œ she wakes up, and she said, I have it in my Œ I remembered that I have this painting. I will go there, and maybe she will allow us to take this truck, and Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 109somehow we will go back to Ugovoy(ph). We are dressing up, and there is a knock on the door. And there is a man who was th e cobbler, or shoe Œ shoemaker, with a big Polish Œ a Polish man with a big family , and he said, I have a truck for your disposal Œ except that, you know, the Œ 500 rubles per person. At this time already, my older brother, the younger than me, but older brother, went to cadet school already to Ugovoy(ph) and was already on the way down to the camps near ba Œ to get out of Russia Œ Kazakhs Œ [indecipherable] Kazakhstan actually too [indecipherable] I believe. Anyway, so three of us. And my mother said, I don™t have any money. Five hundred rubles is quite a lot for me Œ even one ruble, whatever. And he says Œ he said, what do I need rubles for? You have been always kind to me, you send me some Polish fri ends that I could have worked, and I gained; you children played with my children; and you never showed me, you know, the Œ the difference that I am a cobbl er, and you are a lady. Or something like that, something of that sort. You can even dispose whom else of your friend could go, we Œ I had couple, and we sat on that truck. But how to get out of Jambul ? He, this cobbler, had a friend, a Polish Jewish friend, one of those who willingly went to Œ to Russia, who had some NKVD friend too. And he said that he will put on his friend coat as NKVD man taking people to the collective farms, because this is Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 110harvest time. So all people on the Œ in the city will very often volunteered, or not really, forced to go to the Œ Q: But they were Œ yeah, as volunteers. A: Right. Q: Yes. A: And th Œ so, I™m taking people to the farms. So he went around at night. We were supposed to speak only Russian so in case we passed some places where they could recognize. And we got there on time, two days before the train from Ogovoy(ph) was go-going south. And this Organish (ph) Koppage (ph), that Captain Organish (ph) Koppage (ph) was there, and we were helpful in getting three people: the doctor from Kokpekti, what I told you my mother was sick, then he Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ he only told my mother, you sickness with the legs and kidneys wa Œ is only good to go back to Poland to Œ through Skaviets(ph), which is the kind of Œ Q: A resor Œ a sort of a sanitorium? A: A resort for the Œ right. Q: Yeah. A: But anyway, he Œ I think he was old bachelor, you know, old widower. Anyway, he was alone. He was Pole of Jewish faith. The rule was set for Poles to take only Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 111the Polish Christians because according to Russian Œ I don™t know whether it™s Constitution or whatever, they Œ the Jews are not Polish citizen, they are now Russian citizens, and they cannot leave. So we somehow hid him on transport, we knew Pole Œ Polish, and we Œ in that tr ain. And it was at this time, this was passenger train. So we could sit on the steps of the entrance of the Œ into the wagon, and sometimes if, at the station, the NKVD was coming, or some soldiers were coming, we would tell very Œ this is anot her family, m-mother and father who my mother knew for man-many years previously, from Kraków . They haven™t seen each other, but somehow found themselves at the station in Jambul Œ Q: In Ugovoy(ph). A: Right, uga Œ Ugovoy (ph). And we also told her. So with that girl, very nice, brown curly hair, beautif Œ beautiful girl, we were sitting at tho Œ and we™d say sometimes, my mother has the papers, my mo ther is there, or something like that. So they knew, they would hi de these people, and so we transported these people, smuggled them out. Q: How many did you sm uggle out? The doctor Œ A: The doctor and the Œ the father, mother and Aldonna(ph) was the name of the Œ Aldonna (ph) is a famous Lithuanian name. So she was with us, we later on met in Teheran, but that™s much later. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 112Q: And were they all Jewish? A: Hm? Q: These were all Jewish people? A: They were Jewish. But they were assimilated Polish Jews. Q: Right, right, okay. A: You Œ you don™t Œ you didn™t Œ Q: You didn™t distinguish, yeah. A: Œ ask even, something, you know, in Œ Q: Yeah. A: But anyway, they were supposed to be on Œ forbidden to leave Soviet Union , and couldn™t get on the list. So since Capitan Koppage(ph) was there, they had us wrote the list, he put them on. And Œ but it was still not quite proper, so to make sure that Œ Q: Right. A: Œ the Russians would not demand the Œ the papers or some Œ some kind of checking up. But anyway, we are going from Ugovoy(ph) through Jambul , back going south. Since there Œ you have to think about that Ugovoy(ph), the trains were sent few days before. And some people had little children whom they left in Œ Q: In Jambul? Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 113A: Œ in Jambul , to come to the station of Jambul , and get on the train, because they will keep the tr Œ place for them on the train, going together. Q: Right. A: Some had the old parents, w ho couldn™t make it 180 kilometers. Q: Right. A: So, they also waited. We are slowly arriving in Jambul. Train stops, so slows down. We come, and are faced with the closed gates, and closed bars, from the people who are trying to get on the Œ on the station. And they closed our Œ all our doors, so nobody can get out from our trai n. And they tell us, these people cannot go. And you can imagine I k Œ I will never forget to my dying day, the hands, the Œ the crying, the screams of the people, through the iron post stretching the arms to the parents who are on the train going away . Or the children of the people who are supposed to get on the train, and i-it™s a Œ it™s a horror story in that sense. For two hours we stayed, they would not let open one Œ for one person, our door or the railings for the Œ Q: There. A: Œ people. And I Œ and train starts, a nd you can hear one big cry of all these voices. I still have my hair stand at the back of my neck, because you Œ I Œ I will never forget that scene. The train goes and goes and the people cry and slowly train Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 114goes faster and faster and the crying is Œ continues on the train, but we already don™t hear that crying on this tr ain. And this was one of the most horrific scenes that I remember from all that kind of travel. So after several days, because they™re quite a distance from Jambul to Œ from Ugovoy(ph) and Jambul to Krasnovodsk , we came to Krasnovodsk, they let us on the beaches, a nd we had to walk to the port, which was actually at Œ also trade ports, when they have the o il barrack -- barracks all Œ ship, on which we had to Œ they didn™t have hume Œ cells or rooms or anything, they had Œ we had to be on top. We got Œ there were still some people who came, knowing that Krasnovodsk is the place from which Poles will be traveling. Some people traveled by hook or by crook all the way to Krasnovodsk, but they still did not let some of these people Œ Q: Join. A: Œ because this were different people, this is a two, three days travel. Q: That™s right. A: Tam Œ they s Œ the others stayed. Q: Yeah. A: And they couldn™t find our name on the list, and so mebody, some man picked up my Œ I had the small bundle, which contai ned a pot. You had to have always pot, because the kipiatok is always given on the station, and that™s the only way you can Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 115make tea, or soup or whatev er. So this was Œ and my Krakowian (ph) kind of a dress, which I, when I wore it, when seven years old, but you couldn™t sell that to the Soviet or Cossacks. So anyway, I still had it with me. And I didn™t have much clothing, I think I had one dress, and in th at was a Œ whether I had dress on, or I had the blouse, and a skirt, this was my own things, and probably toothpaste, or whatever, I don™t know whether there was even toothpaste. These things I Œ kind of vanished from my memo ry. And the Œ finally they found our name. This man says, well, I™ll go up Œ because these people were very busy Œ and he took advantage of them being busy Œ took my small thing, and said, I™ll find a place for you, keep it for your mother and your brother. And he really did that, after they found our places, and we come, and we see him sleeping on the row of big ropes that go for Œ on the Œ on the big boats, like they have rope s. Unfortunately, we are not leaving for some time. We were supposed to leave in the evening, and this is now night, and the NKVD is full, walking around the people, taking all the documents, and all the Œ trying to Œ most of Œ but it was, you know, people were so, like pressed like sardines. Anyway, at one point, they come to this man who took my things. It happened to be one of those free going to paradise persons, who were communist, who wanted Œ and after two years he learne d what™s the paradise, and he wanted to get out of Russia. But he didn™t exist on any lists of Polish officers or anything. So Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 116they took him, they took 13 peopl e who were trying to get out of Russia without document, proper documents. [phone ringing] And anyway, we got on the train. Took us two day, and th-the Œ over to Paklevy (ph). [interruption] Q: Okay. Okay, so you just left Russia and then ta Œ A: We were on that boat. Q: Yeah. A: And we reached Paklevy(ph), which is a port in Œ on the Iranian, or Persian side, and they set us in a camp on the beach, with the Œ you know, they gave us the blanket, and there were sticks, four stic ks, and covered the blanket as a roof, and they put Œ they gave us some Œ anothe r blanket or so, to lie down on it and wait until we have to g Œ to be de-liced, and disinfected to go to the next place. They took all, or whatever clothing we had on, they burned that, or cleaned them. It all depends Œ I Œ I don™t know how Œ how you Œ they looked, or whatever. And then you go to another Œ that took a couple of weeks. By then my mother was very sick with dysentery. Because, what happened was that dieticians did not work on those Œ at the camps. For the hungry people who have not seen any good food for two, three, four years, you don™t give the lamb soup, with the hot fat on top to the people who are completely devoid of any Œ Q: Nutrients, yeah. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 117A: Œ kind of nutrition, so they don™t have how to digest it. So very often, many of them came down with dysentery, but on Œ my mother didn™t tell me that she always when Œ what relieved her, sh e would go to the sea, to the water, and she would sit there, because that relieved her pain. But then they put us on th e next Œ next camp. Then, I don™t remember how many weeks it took yet to be there. We met my brother, who was still in another camp, but he was then [indecipherable] or young cadet Œ what later on they called young cadets, because Anders was organizing the school for the young boys, to take as many as possible because there were many orphans coming. So anyway, we met with him. He was Œ he went to Teheran earlier. We joined in Teheran , but not in the same camp , he was in the army, and we were in civilian camps in Teheran. And that™s the Œ Q: This is a Œ A: Œ end Œ this is the be ginning of September, 1942. Q: No, it couldn™t be ™42, was it? A: Forty-two. Q: Was it ™42? A: Right, ‚41, the war started; ™41 earlier. Q: That™s right, okay, and so then it takes a while, ™42, Œ A: Forty-two. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 118Q: Œ so you™re still in the middle of the war, okay. A: Middle of the war Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ we cannot go anywhere. Q: Right, okay. A: And anyway, the Œ then there are camps, three camps. My mother was taken from the truck, because she had very high temperature, and what had proven, she had typhoid, both Œ both typhoids; the skin typhoid and stomach typhoid and dysentery. Then later developed Œ she was really Œ Q: Sick. A: Œ si Œ very sick, they took her to the hospital. And I had Œ that was quite a walk. I waited on the bus that was taking some peopl e to visit people in the hospital. It was Œ had to go through almost the side of Teheran itself. We were Œ the camps were outside of Teheran. In the Œ Q: Let™s Œ you know, since we have only 20 minutes of tape Œ A: Mm-hm. Q: Œ let™s go to the main events that happened after that. In September ™42, you were in the civilian camps in Iran. And how long were you in Iran in total? A: In total until ™44. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 119Q: So you were there Œ A: Spring ™44. Q: You spent two years there. A: Yes, much of it was in the hospital, because after my mother got better Œ Q: Yes. A: Œ I start Œ I got couple of the Œ couple of pneumonias, and with pleurisy and was very sick for a little while. But somehow I survived, but it meant that I spent a lot of time in the hospital, but I started also th ey Œ they were organizing the schools, which was sitting on the bricks in some hangar with the ho Œ old airport, near Teheran was unused, so there were hangars, and we were sitting there, and the teacher was giving us lessons. There were no books, of course, but we were writing. There was some probably note pa pers, and we were learning. Then, in the Œ in Œ we were moved to another camp. We were Œ at first we were so-called second camp, but in the first camp they had much more modern buildings, or some kind of civilization type of thing, and the scho ol started, there were classes, and Œ Q: And this was all under the British jurisdiction. A: Yes. The Poles were running it. Q: Right, right. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 120A: It was the Œ the British organized it, but the Œ we were in that second camp, and one Œ once when I was in th e hospital Œ out of the hospital Œ going out of the hospital, the doctors sent me to the thir d camp, which was in the mountains. So, because of my pneumonia, I think that they did not realize what I Œ la Œ only in am Œ in America la Œ years later, that I had developed TB, but it was not quite progressive, or becoming more, so they di dn™t recognize it. Anyway, so many sick people ho Œ you know, small th ings like this did not really come to notice. And so I was, for a few months le Œ summer months, when there was a scouting jubil Œ jamboree at that camp, with the beautiful trees, and somehow a lot of young people from all different camps, and Œ and afterwards I came back to Œ to the camp, and then we were taken to Akwaz(ph), which is going south. Akwaz(ph) is the Œ Q: Still in Iran? A: Still in Iran. The hottest place on earth, so they say. Anyway, it™s in the desert, but the buildings are, you know, the regul ar buildings, cement, or whatever. And they put us in big, like war Œ not warehouses, you co uldn™t call it some Œ some maybe Œ old shops that they didn™t have anything to sell, but the Œ Q: Right. A: Œ open places. And there we were for about, oh, that would happen that we came, I think, to the end Œ end of ™43, into the spring Œ Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 121Q: Of ™44. A: In ™43. Q: Uh-huh. A: In April, they started closing the camps. The Œ because the Russians were afraid of so many Poles living clo Œ so close by to Russia, urged Œ Q: The British. A: Œ the British to take the Polish refugees out of there, and the pole Œ they organized the camps all over their commonwealth. Some of them were in India, some of them were in Africa Œ many were in Africa. Q: What about you? What happened with you? A: When Œ we were supposed to go to India. My Œ my brother first came back to us, but shortly afterward decided to go to the high school, wh ich would be cadet school in Palestine. So he was supposed to go there, he still stayed in Œ in Teheran, but we were put on the boat in Basra, which is no name now. Q: Yeah. A: And were to go to India. Unfortunately, the Japanese submarines were looking out for the British navy, who was the whole group of boats were going, the navy b Œ navy ships were going, and we were am ong them, the only passenger and refugee, about thousand people or so. And they were attacking in submarines, so we hid in Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 122Aden, just close to the Mapiss(ph), you know, the Arabian peninsula, and then on the other side is the port Adem Œ Aden, who is the Œ was a British kind of a center of defense or whatever. So we stayed off the port, but in Œ away from these Japanese things. And after a few days we let out, still intent to go to India, to Karachi , where they had camps, Karachi and Œ in in Œ India at that time Œ Q: Was part of Pakista Œ Pakistan was part of India . A: Later on. Q: Yeah. A: But still it was India. Q: Okay. A: And they had some Œ already some camps, people in the camps, but we still ha Œ met with the Japanese submarines, so they started Œ told Œ the order was to go down eastern side of Africa, to go to Mombasa . Q: Okay. A: And in Mombasa they said, now, all our camps are full. Q: Okay. A: You have to go to another one. Q: Oh my.

But because of history, not many people felt safe to go in back, unless they had some close relatives or children or parents they wanted to help out. But otherwise, it wasn™t quite wise to go.

We thought w Œ we someho w got Œ by mistake, too, because his name was the same like our cousin™s name who is captain. And he said, Tadeusz Pawulski , well, let him come. But then afterwards they said, well, he is Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 129cadet, he cannot come, but we were already on the boat to England . So we arrived in England in 1948, in Œ if I remember correctly, June or July, in Œ in the western Gloucestershire, where there was a big [indecipherable] divide Poles. Most Poles came there, and from there they were sent to different camps. And afterwards, I Œ we learned that some of our relatives who were in London, and invited us to come to London, my Œ I found my mother a job as Œ because she didn™t know English very well at that time anyway. She was the Œ how you call it Œ the person who washes the [indecipherable] in Œ caretaker of the apartment houses where they have Œ she Œ Q: Okay. A housekeeper.

And I was give n a Œ a cou Œ work at one of my uncle™s packages to Poland office, to write some addresses on the things, on the Œ and to be able to live, because my mother, by her Œ [break] Q: All right, so after Œ when di Œ where were you when the war ended? Do you remember? A: We were in Africa. Q: Were you in Rhodesia ? Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 130A: We were in Rhodesia . Q: Do you remember the day? A: No. Q: Do you remember hearing about it? A: We Œ by then we had news papers, and we were living in the open society, so to speak, the teachers and Œ Q: Right. A: So we knew, and we also knew that the soldiers who were, as you probably know the Œ there were so many Polish soldiers in the west, in Œ fighting with the Œ on the side of the allies, were coming to England after, choosing no t to go back to Poland . And so that Œ the end for them came, and most Œ many of them went to England. Q: How did your family Œ how did your mo ther res Œ react, how did your brother Œ how did your brothers react? How did Œ when you found out the war is over, what were your first thoughts, if you can remember. A: I only Œ what I can say, the Œ we were always planning to go back to Poland. Situation was that Lvov was under Ukraine. Q: Yeah. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 131A: There was no Lvov for us. Eastern part of Poland , the big chunk of po Œ Poland , now was Œ Q: Part of Ukraine. A: Œ given to Stalin. Q: Yes. A: And also, my mother contacts Œ was ha ppy and was lucky to get some contacts in Poland with the relatives. And the brother of my father, who lived in Warsaw , what I told you, about that I visited, he wrote to my mother, watch out, because your sons have finished high school, and when Œ if you come back now to Poland, they take all the children of intelligentsia, so to speak, because by then Œ Q: That™s right. A: Œ Poland™s intelligentsia was practically all gone Œ to the Russian Œ Russia, first to the schools for officers, for the army officers, and my mother said, I am not Œ we just got out of Russia, I am not Œ Q: Letting my Œ A: Œ willing to go and lose my sons once they go to Russia with the no Œ we know the situation Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ what will happen, what might happen. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 132Q: Yeah. A: And so we went to England, decided that we will go to England. And since many of our friends were in the army, many of our Œ some of our relatives were already Œ some of them did not go the sa me route that we went. Some of them during the 1939, happened to be outside of Poland . When Poland was attacked they went to France , or they went to England. And they Œ Q: And they could help you then, coming in. A: Œ had Œ they were somehow su ggesting that we go to Œ go to England and wait there. Q: Did you have Œ A: There was always the hope y Œ [indecipherable] was there, so there was always yet the Œ and based on any Œ anything special, it™s still Œ that it can™t be that Poland will be cut in half and given away, and that Lvov will never be Polish. And so because of that, we stayed in England to be close enough to the continent, to Poland . Q: Did Œ by that point, did you have any hope that your father was still alive? A: No, we didn™t. No, I didn™t. We knew that the prisoners of war were killed, but where they were buried, we didn™t know. Q: And you knew by whom they were killed? Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 133A: We knew that wa Œ from the Œ we didn™t have any doubts. Q: Okay. A: Because the letters stopped in April Œ Q: That™s right. A: Œ 1940. There were still no Germans in Œ in Russia. Q: Right. A: So the Germans could not have killed them. In anything there were so many witnesses, and Œ Q: When it all started, you were a 12 year old girl? A: Right. Q: And when it ended, you were already in your upper teens? A: Mm-hm. Q: Almost a young woman. A: Mm-hm. Q: So you could say that yo ur Œ your teenage years Œ A: Well, vanished. Q: Yeah. Yeah. A: And that is somehow unrecover Œ Q: Unrecoverable. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 134A: Unrecoverable. Q: Did you feel that loss? A: Yes. Q: How? In what ways? A: In Œ not in the bad ways, in somethi ng Œ becoming more serious person. The not having the common language with the averag e English girls of my age, and even some of the Polish girls who were younger, or older, the different Œ different ways they Œ trouble they found themselves in England. And Œ Q: Were you lonely? A: Œ but also strong. Stronger. Q: Yeah. You felt stronger. A: Stronger as a human being, I think. Q: And how? Why did you feel stronger, because you had lived through so much, and you survived it? A: Maybe in Œ in the fact of these thoughts, and I was, shall we say, more on the serious sides, and I wanted to study, I wanted to finish university courses, or something, by the Œ way I went to the London University dean of history, and he assured me I had the Polish pa pers translated, no-no Œ not Œ [indecipherable] Q: What kind of certi Œ Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 135A: Notified. Translated Œ Q: Notarized certificate? A: Notarized. And on basis of that, I wa Œ I had a place, but I couldn™t get the scholarship, because even though it was given by the Polish government in London, had the money, but as the young wo man who was giving me an interview, when I asked for the scholarship to go, what do you need university for? The Œ the girls who go to universities go for Œ to find the husbands. We can Œ we don™t have money to spend on such material. I can give you only the scholarship for some business administration, two years™ cour se. So I started college. But the Œ the thinking was the women, without realizing that actually, the woman who is educated is really the mother of future people. Q: That™s right. A: Fathers are outside, earning the life, but the mothers teach the children. [coughs] Excuse me. But that was about Œ so I started college. Q: With a business administration Œ A: For business administration, but I didn™t finish, because by Œ I got married in Œ during Œ after one year, I met my husba nd. There were some Polish women who organized evenings for the young people , because there were many soldiers who returned from the army, and other places, went into college, and were a-alone Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 136sometimes. And there were no really places that you would meet, as normal Œ in normal life, and so they organized, among th eir friends, to have socials. And on Œ I was invited to one of the socials by a friend of my mother™s, and Œ and a friend of her mother™s. And when the Œ and met my husband, although I remember him coming into the room full of people. I re member his coming. And the song from the ﬁSouth Pacific,ﬂ one Œ the evening Œ we remember the Œ one enchanted evening, you will see a strangers across the Œ and I see Œ the same thing happened. I saw my husband, and I saw his eyes, and somehow I Œ I saw him. He didn™t see me, of course, because there™s a group of people, 30 people or 40 people around. But then I had the mistake learned Œ mistaken idea that he came with a lady who brought her son to that party, as a young man to Œ for having, you know, a chance to meet. And she came also with a young woman, who was telling to this young woman™s mother, and Œ mother, which I assumed that she mu st be daughter-in-law, because she turns mother-in-law, so he is married. So, out. No more intention of getting to know closer. And I Œ somehow we had supper quite well done by all the ladies™ mothers and all that. And after, there was some dance Œ dancing in the living room, and I used Œ my braids I put on Œ in the crown of the head. And in one Œ he approached me Œ my husband approached me to ask for the dance. And when there was some Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 137kind of the changing of guard, when I had to go under his arm, or something like that Œ you know, the steps sometimes, his Œ Q: Cuff? A: Œ button Œ cuff Œ o-on Œ on the cuff, caught my hair. And there is a saying that you somehow get connected with Œ there is this Œ with your hair gets into some Œ your button gets into the hair of somebody, that there is something, that you become friends, or Œ Q: A connection is established. A: Connection established. So he looked at me and let me s Œ let me see the person that I am to Œ to know. Q: Yeah. A: But then I still rem Œ think he™s married. So I discourage him. He Œ I would sit here, and he would come and sit nearby, and I would make excuse and go to another place. And then I was looking through my pocketbook, and there was some picture Œ tickets from the Albert Hall in London, that I went to the concert, and he would tell me, oh, he wished that he knew me by then, he would have accompany me. And I said, well, it passed, and I would move to another place again. And then it™s time to go home, and this lady with her daughter Œ by then I know that he is Œ he is a Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 138friend of the son of this woman, who does n™t like to go to any dances, so he chose his friend to Œ Q: Come with him. A: Œ replace him. Q: Ah, okay. A: So he was not the married type, but he said he will help the Œ to go the Œ Q: Right. A: Œ through the underground, to the next station, where the other people would go, the Mrs. Topalitska(ph) and her daughter, and her Œ the friend of her son. But then he got Œ I got to change the underground trains, he went Œ changed with me. He said, I™ll take you all the way. And then took the bus who was number 28, all the way to Kilburn, northern part of London. And I Œ he would go there and got the address where I am, because I didn™t want him Œ Q: To know. A: Œ to know where Œ the address of Œ so wrote down his street number and forced me to give the Œ I did not have telephone at that time. The Œ the person downstairs who lived, he had the public telephone n earby, so he would pick up the telephone and call me sometimes. So he didn™t know, I didn™t give him the telephone, I gave him the address, and he Œ and he Œ the th ing was Œ another small coincidence; bus Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 139number 28 ends at Kilburn, at north, but ends at the quite the southern part of London when he lived Œ where he lived close by. So he took the same, the last bus that took me there, coming back was going to last route, all the way to the place where Œ Q: He lived. A: So it Œ somehow it just. Q: That Œ that button in the hair did it. A: Oh yes. Q: So, when did you get married, and when did you come to the United States? A: We married about Œ I Œ I was still going to school, to the college, studying. And then, in the spring, he was one of the soldiers Œ America gave 125, I believe, visas to the Œ at the end of the war, when the people went out of the army, and did not choose to go to Poland, or go to another country to settle, America offered the permanent visa, a permanent settlement in America. And that was the spring Œ yes, not even Œ we got married in August, that™s six Œ eight months after we met. We met in December Œ this was around Christmastime, the party was. And the Œ in -- we got married, and then, I think it was some oct Œ October or November, when the letter from the American embassy came to my husband, that you are on the list of these people who are offered to settle. Will you choose to take up Œ to pick up the Œ Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 140and go to live in America? By that time, I Œ he was married, so he tried to get me on the Œ you know, on the list. But then, Americans at that time were very strict about letting people come into America, so no sick person could go, n-no some political Œ Q: Sure. A: Œ things. And they called me three times for the medical tests. I di Œ I was very surprised Œ we were very surprised, not knowing why. By the time Œ by this time, I think I was expecting a baby Œ not yet. Well, anyway, we sa Œ finally got the ala Œ the permission for me to participate. He and his mother, who was in the army too Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ who was in Œ in Russia with him, and he was in th e cadet school, as I told you Œ Q: Yeah, yeah. A: Œ in the Persia, and to Iraq, and to the Palestine . But he Œ he and his mother went Œ were going Œ she was in the army too, so she went, as Œ entitled to it, and I was put on the list, and we went to the United States. But because it was ending, the program, we were too late to be paid the Œ the Œ because they Œ they Œ they gave the tickets for nothing, to a certain degree, who wouldn™t Œ who said he™s going to. Q: Right. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 141A: We were too late for it, so my future mother-in-law Œ all then, not future, mother-in-law, had some friends who lend us her Œ some money, who paid the Œ some ticket transportation, and came in the boat. Q: Did you land here in New York ? A: In the Œ February, ™52. 1952. Q: In February 1952. A: Late February. Q: Did you ever go back to Lvov ? A: I visited Lvov couple of times. It was still Œ there was definitely Œ Poland was by then free, there were changes. In 90 Œ 1996 was the year they had the Œ my elementary school, had the 180th anniversary, and they somehow invited some people who were at the school. And my br other, who lives in eng Œ one of them lives in England, in England they were much more connected, they knew more of the things and he told us that there is a chance to go to Œ to Lvov, as part of the Œ Q: Right. A: Œ group Œ Q: Right. A: Œ for that occasion. So ™96 Œ Q: Is when you went. Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 142A: Œ was my Œ with my brothers, who were also started the school Œ lower grade Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ but started the school, and when one from then Texas, and my oth Œ the older brother lives in Texas now [indecipherable] but he went Œ came here, and we went together to Œ to Œ Q: Lvov. A: Œ Poland. Q: Yeah. You have shared today a really Œ an amazing story. As I said earlier, it would be very hard to believe that all of these things happened to one person, and that, you know, for Œ it starts with a 12 year old girl who has a normal life up until that point, and between age 12 and age 19, goes through so many different Œ I mean, hell and back. What would you wa nt Œ what would you want younger generations to understand about all of this? About these experiences? What do you think you™d want to pass on to them? A: That™s a very difficult question. You have to stick to your ethics, to what you learned as a Œ whether it was only in school, or it was only in religion, or also only from watching your parents, wa tching the people Œ I Œ I c onsider myself lucky that even in Africa in the high school, we had extremely good people, honorable people, Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 143who were thinking along the lines that I was thinking, not carpe diem type of thing Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ not lightly look at Œ at life. Be of some use to humanity. Be a Œ a person who has lived, but gave something of herself to the Œ to return for good, that somehow I received from time to time, throughout these difficult times. And also, I wo Œ maybe I always wanted something more serious, even if Œ I remember in small Œ in the small grades they Œ that I wasn™t a flighty, stupid, young girl, who just from one ice cream would go to a stupid movie a lthough my parents would know where I could go, or where I shouldn™t go. But anyway, I think that life is much more serious than just to catch up, or a false fame by something Œ Q: When you were in London, right befo Œ before you met your husband, and you said you didn™t find any co mmon language sometimes, and I wanted to ask you: did you feel lonely? I mean, you ha d gone through such experi Œ [loud noise] [technical difficulties] [break] I guess I wanted to wrap up the interview with, what your final thoughts would be, and what you were able to maintain, and how you felt you had changed, if you had changed. What final words would you want to leave with people? Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 144A: As I mentioned, and you suggested that actually I didn™t have childhood; I was still standing mentally to a certain degree, or psychologically, a 12 year old girl who had to sometimes face more difficult things , working to Œ to get something to eat Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ or to help my mother to help us. That made me much more aware of seriousness of life. And when I came to England , to Œ so to speak to normal life, and went to London, and lived in London, met some other people, I still was not hungry for light Œ kind of young teenagers like nowadays you see Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ an Œ around, whether on television, or you met during that Œ Q: Sure. A: Œ stay in a Œ in England . I wanted to study. I was very close to my mother, and somehow they si Œ some of the girls that I worked at the cook™s office, that I said I worked after the second job in London , that I don™t know how you live like that; you are so close to your mother; whether you will be able to get married, because you won™t cut yourself off that closeness. But I Œ I think that was maybe this Œ and maybe something of a un-conscience way of holding to something that holds me to pre-war times, that holds me to my father, in a sense, to the time when I was Œ Q: Well you had Œ Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 145A: Œ somehow Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ more serious looking at life, and also when Œ in the high school, I remember that I developed that feeling that the teachers and the chairman of our Œ director of our high school said, which was accordin g to what I was thinking and what my father taught me, that by y our behavior, you are ambassador of your country. And I never stopped loving Poland, and always thinking that maybe some ter Œ something might happen, like the things that you did not plan happened, that you will go back. And th Œ I will never got rid of my hope that Œ a-and longing for Lvov. And I visited Lvov, then afterwards I visited twice or three times later. Lvov was very neglected, and you could see the Œ kind of Ukrainians trying to cut all the traces to Polandism , and I could not find the names of the street that I knew, because first of all they were changed, but they were changed in the Ukrainian alphabet. So I didn™t ever learn that Ukrainian, so Œ but I still had a feeling that I was walking on my traces Œ tracing my steps, when I was going to school. I visited Œ my school was taken by Œ over by Ukrainian high school, but the Œ next to it was the Œ the boys™ school before the war, which now they united the girls™ school and boys™ school, Polish, one of two schools in Lvov, which is Polish, and Polish teachers, very high level of learning, and when Ukrainians are sending Œ Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 146Q: Their children there. A: Œ children there, because they have the chance then to go to Poland , to the universities. More Œ it™s easier for them because Lvov University ha Œ is overflowing by the people from the villages, or from Œ Q: Of course. A: Œ other parts of Russia or Ukraine. Q: Yeah. A: But this thing and Œ and the sense of va lue and sense of feeling responsible, that whatever you do, it somehow influen ces the lot of many people that Œ Q: That you have an effect. A: It has the effect, or somehow if people would talk to each other. My Œ my son, the oldest son, when there was some boys who, as I told you, being of Œ having foreign name here in Œ in America too, that Œ that they Œ sometimes he was the victim of a bullying, and so to speak, a nd when they Œ they came to our house, and through Œ through the window, the bags Œ baggies full of water. So they attacked my br Œ my son, and he wanted to go out and start fighting. And I said no, you have to learn somehow to deal with this in the way to explain the anger of somebody for no reason at all; and to tolerate Œ not really tolerate, but to understand that prejudice, you don™t fight with the same fi ghting spirit, but you try to look to the Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej May 8, 2013 147future that the future will be more peaceful, and more people talking to each other, or sa Œ something on that Œ Q: Yeah. That you don™t Œ you don™t answer in the same way that you are being attacked. A: Right. Q: Yeah. A: You don™t lower yourself to the same level, if somebody unreasonably attacks you Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ for whatever reason. You only lower yourself as a human being, responding the same way. Q: Well, Mrs. Maria, thank you. Thank you very much, for sharing so much. A: You™re welcome, and thank you very much for your understanding, and your Œ the questions that you put, trying to, some how, to understand how I tick, so to speak, right? Q: Well, I Œ I Œ there are no words, because I have never gone through such a thing, and all I can say is what you have done today is given us a real gift Œ A: Thank you.
