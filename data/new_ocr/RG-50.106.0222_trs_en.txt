There wasn™t a problem having it, the Nazis. A: No, no, no. Q: They let you have it. A: There was no reason for it because the synagogue still was there and that was between us. They didn™t mix in that time. But I li ke to actually , people who lived in that village, they all liked us because my father was very, very known and he did a good job at his papering. And mother, Interview with Hugo Herzog 12 March 6, 2014 everybody knew t hem and they always said Albert don™t worry, they don™t do anything to you or to y our family. Yeah, but that™s what they said. Q: What was the name of your father™s store? A: I don™t remember.

And I™d arrive there by train every day. Q: Every day? A: Every day, yes. And altogether that was going on for about, I would say four or five months. And then they closed that too. And that was the end of my education. Q: What year was that? Do you know, do you remember? You said eighth grade I think is what you sai d. A: (pause) Q: It™s ok. What did you do when you couldn™t go to school? A: My father , he belonged to a group. They called themselves , you understand the German. Q: Not really, but maybe you can translate it. A: I remember Reichsbund Judesche Fronsoldaten [ph Œ German]. That means Organization of the Jews who were fighting during World War II, World War I and they had a newspaper. Interview with Hugo Herzog 13 March 6, 2014 And they also advertised if they needed somebody, some help or somebody, some certain places. So my father said the best thing is you have to get out of the house. You cannot stay in the house because you™ve got to get up, go out. And doing. And I may have, I™ll tell you the whole story. There was a ad looking for a young fellow who is willing to get in the clothing trade so my father said that might be the thing for you. So I volunteered. Volunteered, they volunteered me. (laughs) Q: You may volunteer. A: I was a volunteer and it lasted quite (sound interference) I would say quite a bit, might be a distance from where I used to live . I would say about 150, 200 miles away. So I was there for one night, for one night and I said to myself I don™t like it here and I™m not interested in this and I™m not going to stay here. So I, I sent a telegram to my father and I wrote send me money. Or I™m going to do something. Well they telegraphed me money and I didn™t say anything to the owner of that place where I was supposed to work but he knew something was not kosher and he was watching every move I made. So he seen me going t o the post office, picking up that, the money and I didn™t even take my clothes and I run to the station. And the first train was coming just as I got to the station, the first train came in. But I see that the owner of that store, he was behind me and so I don™t know if he seen me or not but he was watching more if I step in the train or not. But there was a, I seen there a big garbage disposal there and I jumped in, not to be seen. And wait til the train moved away and after he was gone, I got out of the re, tried to clean myself up a little bit. Anyhow, it worked and I got into the next train and then from there to Mannheim. I mentioned Mannheim. There was my brother at that time. He found a trade. And so I figured that was on the way home. Was staying there for a day or two and then I went back home. And my father asked me, what would you have done, if you wouldn™t have us send the money? Because I said at that time, send me money or I™m going to do something. So I said nothing. And that was the end of t hat. Q: So now you™re back home with your family and what did you do then? A: I don™t recall. Interview with Hugo Herzog 14 March 6, 2014 Q: We™re talking about what year? What year are you talking about when you went away? A: Talking about years. I™m getting confused. Q: That™s ok. And then the next big change happened when or how? A: The next big change was the, I was accepted in Cologne. Cologne there was a Ha Shara [ph], you know what I mean. I was Ha Shara and from all parts of Germany, youngsters, they came over there. But Cologne was not the only one. There were more but I happened to land there in Cologne and I was there. We were, they met. To give us an idea about how things going to be in Palestine. And we were all sure that they™re going to send us to Palestine. And they told us so too but I was one of the last ones, the newest ones who come to this place. So the way I was, so we let, give me one moment please. Yes, oh yeah. Then came an order from the Nazis that every Jewish place where everything Jew s, they are gathering together, the youngsters. They want so and so many of them they should work for them. So since I was really one of the latest who came in that place, to that place. They didn™t want me to go. They wanted to get the elderly, the most Œ Q: The older? A: Th e older ones, yeah. And so we were, they were not too thrilled about it so I said, I volunteered and I landed up in a village not far from Berlin. And we, that was in the winter and the snow was pretty high there and we are cutting trees. It was a bad experience for me because I always had wet feet and if I could not act with the equipment, shoes. The food was not too bad. We got from the farmers. The farmers , they fed us. And we were sleeping at the haystacks. Q: What was the name of the village? A: Lukenweisser I think. Lukenweisser yeah. And I was there for a while, was about a couple of months. Interview with Hugo Herzog 15 March 6, 2014 Q: You were working for the Germans, right? A: Yes, for the Germans. Q: For the Germans A: Yes , yes and after that I said that™s enough for me. I have to do some Œ I said to myself I™ve got to get out of this. So I went to this Jewish Agency to Berlin and managed and I told them I can™t take that no more. So they sent somebody else instead me and I went back to Cologne. Now, from now on, I was there another -- how long, another few months and then there was a trip organized going to Palestine now. I usually the newcomer s, to there had to wait. They were not eligible but in my case they made a diffe rence because I did work for the Nazis over here. They says we™ll get you on there. Now the ones who organized those, a trip was only one trip. And that was the last one. The man who organized that, that was rich Jews and in return they took them also. T hey were allowed to go because the idea was to get the youngsters out ok. So in that case they added them also to Œ Then we went to Vienna. Q: Ok are we talking about 1939? A: 1939, yeah. Q: Do you remember what month or time of year generally. It was before September right? A: Yes let me see. Before September. Q: Cause the war started in September . A: Yeah, it was before September but not much before that. It was yeah. I don™t know exactly . Interview with Hugo Herzog 16 March 6, 2014 Q: That™s ok. When you were working for the Germans, what was the treatment ? I mean were there any anti -Semitic incidents then? A: No, no because we d idn™t see much Germans . They only were walking around and see if you are working or not, but other than that no, no. There was no problem. So like I said Œ Q: Did you have any communication with your parents when you were Œ A: Not at that time. I lost communications. Yeah but later on I picked it up again. Afterwards when I knew I was going to go to Palestine I went home and that was the so called goodbye to my parents. That was the last I™ve seen them. Q: Your brother and your sister, when yo u were leaving, where were they? A: My sister she left to the states in 19, oh she left much earlier. About the year before or two years before the war. I would say two years before the war. She was lucky to get out and at that time it wasn™t really tha t bad in Germany. So she got out. My brother he was working as an iron worker near Berlin and he couldn™t make it so. And my parents they will report to, oh I forgot something yeah which is very important. When yes, at the 38, there was the 38 the Crysta l Night . We moved away to another place and I don™t know why we moved. Q: Were you with your parents on Œ A: Yeah. Q: You were with your parents then? A: I was at that time with my parents. Q: So this is November 38. Interview with Hugo Herzog 17 March 6, 2014 A: Yeah. We moved across the street practically where the synagogue was. We moved in the synagogue and then shortly after they destroyed the synagogue. They took the Torah scrolls. They took them out and they threw them down and they burned it and you kno w the whole thing was in flames. So and Œ Q: You™re 15 years old now so what is that like for a 15 year old boy to see that? A: I don™t remember . I just don™t remember. I know it was a bad feeling for me. I faced reality. So and that was reality. Q: T here was a lot of damage in your town from Kristallnacht? A: In the town, no. The only damage was done was the synagogue. Yeah. Q: Was it the only synagogue in town? A: That was the only one. Q: And so then the next, what happened next? A: Yeah the next thing is there was a Œ we went to Vienna ok. And we were waiting there for a while. They put us in hotels. Q: Did you take anything special with you when you left your family to go to Palestine? A: No, I didn™t have anything special. Just m y cloth es and -- Q: Did you have books? Did you take any books with you? Did you like to read? A: No, I didn™t ____ person. I didn™t have any books with me no. Interview with Hugo Herzog 18 March 6, 2014 Q: Nothing special, just your clothes. A: Nothing special . No. And while we were in Vienna we were in hotels. And from other countries nearby and some youngsters. They all met together there. And not to forget that that was a big sign. Jews are not allowed here. And that™s in those hotels. Every hotel it was a sign, Jews not allowed here. Q: This was after the Anschluss so Hitler had already taken over Austria. A: Oh yeah. Q: So you saw a lot of Nazi flags and Œ A: Yes, yes, yes. Q: Did that bother you? Was it upsetting? A: I™m sure it bothered me. Q: Cause now you were older and you knew what it meant? A: Yeah and how. Yes. And Œ Q: Is it something you would talk over with the other young boys you were with? Did you talk this over, about Hitler and anti -Semitism ? A: Which other boys? Q: You were with a group of young people you said. Interview with Hugo Herzog 19 March 6, 2014 A: Oh yeah sure. We was with them, we were like friends. Q: Was it coed? Was it boys and girls? A: Yes, yes. So Œ Q: And what was the age range? A: The age range. I don™t know. I would say 15, maybe let me think about it. Q: That™s ok. So now you™re in Vienna and you stayed there for how long? A: For just about a week and then they drove us to the Danube, the river. And we were, there were three ships and they brought us to Sulina , that™s in Romania, that™s beyond the Black Sea. From the Danube we went in there. And we from there, w e see n the little freighter standing and they transported us to the freighter. The freighter is supposed to go to Palestine. Now when we came to that freighter, they had some bunks there but not enough to take care of everybody there. So we were there for sev eral weeks because they were waiting for the crew to get our ship out. And finally they came, after several weeks and then they brought us to Palestine. Q: What did Palestine mean to you at that time? A: It didn™t, what it meant was to just to get out. Palestine actually, I was not a Zionist. I didn™t know anything about that. You thought that it would appear that they were talking about Zionists so anyhow we came to Haifa. Q: Did you feel very German before that? Did you consider yourself German? A: Yes, yes I did. And everybody did. Practically. Q: Even your parents felt that they were German. Interview with Hugo Herzog 20 March 6, 2014 A: They felt they were Germans because they were treated nice and everybody treated them nice until really shortly before the Crystal night. Then everythi ng changed. And we knew that there™s no future for us. And we came to Haifa so it took us a long time. I would say a couple of weeks til we got there. To the Œ Q: What was the name of the boat, do you know? A: Atific [ph]. Yeah it was a little boat. It was altogether close to a thousand tons that™s all. So and we landed shortly before we came to Œ we landed in Haifa but not at the pier that is in the British. So I forgot something here, yeah. We ran out of coal. We ran out of water. We ran out of every thing because we were several weeks on the sea. And so I volunteered to go to the machine room and took care of the ovens there because I knew you get a little b etter food there whatever. And then when we came to Haifa and there was a big ocean liner stand ing there. I t was supposed to bring us to whole lot. And one of the British islands there, Cyprus yeah. To Cyprus. And so little by little they transferred us to that ocean liner. It was called Patcific , Patria . Was called Patria. And then all of a sudden nobody really wanted to go but we didn™t have no choice. So then the Hagenah did some things. They brought some explosives with the food that they loaded. And they told everybody who was on that boat, not everybody was transferred yet. Maybe were trans ferred I would say about 500 people and altogether we were 900. So what happened was yeah, they told us we should go on deck in the morning. Go to the, on deck there is a meeting so I said I™m going to sleep a little longer. And then all of a sudden I hea rd a boom and I thought it was a bomb. That is over here something not 100 percent kosher so I was running up to the deck. And on my way up I felt already I had to hold on, on the railings because the ship was leaning to the side. And then I came up to, soon I came up on top there. I lost my balance and I slipped to the other side of the Œ and which was a little bit under water already. So I had no choice. I didn™t know how to swim but I jumped in the water. I had no choice. And some fellow seen me. He was in the water too and he seen me that I™m struggling. So he went behind me and he pushed me, kept on pushing me to the little boat they have which came to Œ they didn™t come close to the ocean liner because they figured if something is going to Interview with Hugo Herzog 21 March 6, 2014 happen, something going to explode better to stay away from there. So everybody who got out of there had to swim a little bit. Yeah. So got there on that boat and that was in fact ok with me and we kept to a big, a big hole there. How you call it. I forget. And we got clothes there and we got food there. That™s the Jewish Agency, they took care of everything. And the British, they watched us like a hawk. Q: This is in Cyprus. You™re in Cyprus? A: That was, no that was in Haifa. Q: You™re still in Haifa? A: W e are still in Haifa. Because not everybody was yet transferred to the Patria. The ones who were not transferred to the Patria yet, they think that they are the ones who sent them later to Cyprus. So what happened to us? We went to Atlit , that™s a big ca mp there. And we were there. And then one morning everybody, they got everybody out to Atlit, even the ones who are supposed to go to Cyprus. But then the British came one morning and they got them out, the rest of them. They had their names. They got them out and they rejected so they had they were using sticks and some of the guys there, the people there, they threw their clothes away so then they got, they considered that. They were standing there without clothes, without anything. But they took them out anyhow. And I was in Atlit for about four months. I would say I didn™t have such a bad time there because the food was excellent. I was a volunteer. This time in the kitchen. And they had those big cat, cassels that they put the food whe re they made the food, I don™t know exactly but there were altogether in the camp close to a thousand peo ple, maybe more. And that was in the Œ everything was strictly kosher there. Q: Did you know Hebrew by then? A: No, I knew how to read but it didn™t mean anything to me. I didn™t know the meaning of it. Interview with Hugo Herzog 22 March 6, 2014 Q: You just kne w German. That™s all you knew at the time. A: Pardon. Q: You just knew German, that™s all Œ A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So and I would say I was there for about six months. And after that I went to a kibbutz. They didn™t ask me. They came. They let us go and there was a group already in the kibbutz, Ashdod Yakov . And I was there several months. And I remember it was very hot and so they give us lessons in Hebrew in the afternoon. In the morning, everybody has a little job, something to do. Yeah. But I didn™t pay much attention to the afternoon lessons because was so hot outside. I couldn™t keep more. So that was one thing and then I™m Œ every kibbutz had to send some people into the army at that time because there was a, they called it the Palestinian army. So naturally they didn™t want me to go. They wanted to go people from the kibbutz who are there for a long time. But they told them if you go to the army, you go to the box. The box that m eans that™s the part who stays in Palestine, doesn™t go out of the country. And that™s because at that time, the war was going on and ____ didn™t ____. And they were afraid that Germans getting closer and closer so it™s very important to be in the country, to defend ourselves. But so I didn™t like the kibbutz. I didn™t like the life there. I didn™t like the way -- they treated us ok but I didn™t like to take orders. But anyhow, usually you take anyhow when you get into the army. So I volunteered to the army and Œ Q: You™re 18 by now? How old are you? Are you 18 by now? A: Yeah, I think I was 17 now. Q: It was 1940, yeah ok. A: Yeah so I went to the army and they asked me over there as someone to go overseas. So ok. They took me and they prepared me in Salafet . That™s the, Salafet that™s the place where they got Interview with Hugo Herzog 23 March 6, 2014 the, all the people together which going to be fighting. They prepared us in Salafet, that™s the name of a town. Q: Of a town. Did you, you said you were able to contact your parents? A: No, I did not but my sister had contacted, somehow she contacted me. Q: But you had no contact with your parents? A: No, I didn™t have any. I knew through my sis ter that they transferred them to Lagos h [ph] and the trains and that they were there for several months and then they sent them to Auschwitz. So now where was I? Q: Now you™ re getting training you said cause you told them Œ A: Yeah I got training yeah. I learned how to drive a truck. That™s what. So that was another week so and then they sent us to El Aleman and I felt ok. Everything was nice and quiet. There was no big action going on at that time until one night and they started. Nobody knew what™s going on. We heard artillery and the planes and then we went, we marched forward. And then we came to Benghazi . Benghazi and then to Tripoli. I don™t want to get in all the details. And that was it. I was there when the invasion to Italy started. So we went to get, they put us on landing crafts , big landing crafts with the trucks in there. So we drove in those landing crafts and when we came to Italy that was below Salerno. And we drove out and we had a nice reception there. Luckily I got away without any serious injuries. But then you didn™t see the Germans any more. They disappeared so I was in Italy. I was there for another couple of years. Q: Oh a couple of years. A: A couple of years Let me think, yeah. I joined the British Army in 1942. I remember that. And the war was over in 46. Interview with Hugo Herzog 24 March 6, 2014 Q: 45. A: 45, 45. But I still was in the army til 1946. Yeah. So Œ Q: Did you go back to Palestine or you stayed in Italy, when the war was over? A: When the war was over, it wasn™t over for me yet because you know the war is over, you don™t pack your bag and you go home. _____ So they kept us and then I was yeah, when the war was over I was close to Italy there. Not to Italy. I mean to Austria or whatever. I was very close. And I took a motorcycle and I went to Germany with it. (Other person: You went AWOL) A: AWOL. Q: Oh you did, away without leave. A-W-OL. A: Oh that™s what it is. Away without leave. Yeah. So was they knew of course the motorcycle was missing after a while and I was missing s o it was the reason. The reason why I want, wanted to go to Germany. I wanted to go to Germany because a friend of mine, he told me that Œ did I mention that my brother, that was in Auschwitz too. Q: No you did not. A: No, I didn™t no. He was a good mechanic and they kept them pretty Œ he, I didn™t know much but my friend, he told me, he wrote me that he™s seen a list of this ____ . So I was Œ and he seen the name Herzog there but that™s all. So I asked, but that™s all. Nothing. He says that™s all he knows. He™s a survivor. So I said to myself, I™m going to take a chance. You know I had no rights. So anyhow, how do I get there, to Germany. You know from Italy. You know, well I think that™s the best bet. I took the -- a bicycle and I took off. And I wen t to Illingen. I figured Interview with Hugo Herzog 25 March 6, 2014 maybe I™d see him there. But he wasn™t there. So I asked some people and they told me that he went to Munich. I don™t know what he did in Munich but he™s going to come back and so I was waiting there two or three days and then I decided I have to go back. Yeah. Otherwise I™m going to get in bigger trouble. So on the way back, I stopped near Frankfurt. I stopped there and I says look you have come all the way down here. It took you two days and you get there. Now I™m not going t o leave until I know really what™s going on with my brother. So I turned around and I went back to Illingen. And we™re not talking about from one corner to the other. That™s about 150 kilometers or something like this. So and the people there are very fr iendly. They always want to be with us, so I have no problem to stay with anybody there overnight. Sure enough, a day later my brother shows up. Yes, I was so lucky. I said, look maybe we can arrange, that at that time, the Jewish Altrits [ph] you know the arranged to illegally deport some survives. They brought them to Palestine. Somehow, I don™t know but I had the same chance. To bring my brother over. He says no he™s going to go to the states. I says all right. So I went back to my unit and the camp co mmander happened to be a Jew too. And so I got a court martial and I forgot already what it was but it was not easy but it was only on paper. And that was the end of it so I was there for another few months. Then I went back. I was discharged, kept to, I had suit, a British suit and some money. Not too much. I think was like a hundred dollars something like this tops. And they let us go. And I said that to myself. I™m not going to go to the kibbutz any more. I go to Tel Aviv. So I went to Tel Aviv first in , I also had some money for a hotel for a week or so and was looking for a job. Q: This is 1946 we™re talking about. A: At the end of 46 yeah. And I was with a friend. And he had a sister in Tel Aviv so we went there and we had dinner with them. So in exchange we washed the dishes. Yeah and finally I found a job. It was very hard but I am (both talking). So I found a job in a restaurant washing dishes together with my friend. So but that didn™t last very long because they went bankrupt for one reason or another. And after that I was working for the British. They had on the north side of Tel Aviv, they had a camp with trucks. And those trucks they went out every morning to pick up the Middle East mail which was distributed by Jewish, not only Jewish but Arabs too. And I Interview with Hugo Herzog 26 March 6, 2014 slept in that camp because I ran out of money and I had a little tent there where I slept. So and I picked up every morning, picked up from Tel Aviv and from Jaffa some people and brought them to the camp. They got their truck and everybody took off in different directions. And that™s what I did. And so I was working there for about three months. And then I, one of the guys which I picked up, he says why don™t you come one evening?

A: A little better. Q: I™ll talk a little louder. I was asking what your thoughts about Germany was and you said you were treated very well when you lived there and it™s a new generation. A: Yes , because the like I said, the war was ove r a long time ago and I remember they have certain laws when it c omes to Jews. I remember at that time in Berlin who was the Chancellor in Berlin was, Gerhard something like this. Anybody who says even dirty Jew they put them in jail. Because they felt very guilty of what happened. And so that™s a big part. So they tried to do the best they could. Personally since I™m very familiar with the language, I didn™t have any problem. And there are some, some survivors from the concentration camps, some of them that said I never could go back to Germany. Well that™s understandable. But it™s like a completely different story now. It™s not the way it was. That you cannot forget yes, but that™s what it is. Q: Do you feel very American now? Or German? A: No, rig ht now I™m feeling very American. Yeah. Q: What was it like to become a citizen of the United States? A: Well that™s, that was yeah, I waited five years yeah.

Q: What is the biggest part? A: The biggest, biggest part was about my parents. And otherwise when I was a youngster, that doesn™t bother me anymore that much now. They were fighting with other boys. Q: But you had memories of your parents. A: Yes, definitely. That doesn™t, that doesn™t go away. That stays with me til the end of my life. There™s not a single day that I don™t think about it. Q: Are you angry at the Germans for what happened to your parents? A: No, how could I be. I could be angry of somebody I know who did something but take a look for instance the place back home, from Illingen. They all liked to, they loved us you know. Interview with Hugo Herzog 34 March 6, 2014 Before and then the time come when I came back to see my brother. The most of them still were there. And they all were very happy to see me.

At that time. Q: And w hat were your thoughts during the Eichmann trial? A: My thought was they make a big, too big of a fuss from that. Took a long time but the trial is surprise ok. I would have made it shorter if it would be up to me. B ut I always said that it™s going to be over. And finally it did and but maybe you heard about it. The German states are still found another I think three more Nazis. Q: Have you been back to Israel a lot? Did you go back? A: Yes, I would say at least twice a year. When my wife was alive and her family is still there. Well now it™s a little difficult for me. Q: Do you receive reparations? A: Yes I do. Q: What are your thoughts about that? A: Oh my thoughts about that. Q: Your thoughts? A: Well it™s at least something that they can do that will help me in certain things you know. Interview with Hugo Herzog 35 March 6, 2014 What was a rich guy but e very little bit helps. They cannot bring the dead back, of course not. So at least they pay. Q: Do you feel very Israeli? A: All, yes I feel Israeli too. I follow up what everything what™s going on there. Q: Your daughter said there were some exciting times when Israel became a state in 1948. Is there anything you wanted to add about that time? A: About that time in 48. Q: I n 48, is there any stories you wanted to add to the interview. A: No I know just it was big excitement for everybody. Everybody was dancing on the street and for me as a family , we got our own place. It was a big excitement but the fighting started which didn™t take long so they attacked us from all the sides. From the north and the south and the west and that, I said to myself, sometimes with everything what has happened, I™m still a round. Q: Yes you are. A: I am wondering. And I give you one more detail that I jumped the ship. I didn™t know how to swim. So there was one guy he seen that I was struggling and he helped me. Maybe I mentioned it before. And he helped me to get out. And at that time I didn™t think straight. I just want to be alive, that™s alive that™s all. Q: Do you feel you lost a part of your childhood since you were so young? A: Oh yes, yes I did. I didn™t have much of a childhood. Q: Did you ever get it back? Interview with Hugo Herzog 36 March 6, 2014 A: No I don™t think abou t it now. Q: Do you talk about your experiences with friends? Do people ask you about what you went through? A: My experience. Q: When you talk with friends or people that you meet? Do you talk about your background and what you went through? A: Well not so much about my background but let me put like this because the people who are, I am in touch with. They already know everything. Everybody who knows me who knows what I went through. I know what they went through because mostly I deal with Jewish people, mostly. Q: Did you become more Jewish because of what you went through? A: No. Q: Or less. A: Less. Q: Less. Because? A: Because of what happened. I don™t believe any more. Q: Are you angry that you had to have the loss that you did, whereas people over here in the United States didn™t?

Q: Do you think it could happen again? A: I don™t think it will happen again. But even though the world doesn™t, I think didn™t learn much what happened, but I don™t think it should happen again. No. That™s my opinion. Q: Is there anything else you wanted to add before we close? Anything else you wanted to say or talk about? A: Well it was nice talking to you. I don™t think I have anything special right now. Q: Let me just close off the interview by saying a few words. Ok?
