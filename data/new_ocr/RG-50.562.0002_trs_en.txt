I also remember after the Hungarians came in, this colonel wanted all the Jews -- males 13 and up to come over for a meeting. And he started to lambaste everybody. The Jews are the only ones who are non-pr oductive, non -- no -- nothing. The -- everybody works on Saturday except the Jews, and the Jews better start working on Saturday. So all of a sudden, I was selected to go and get the horses, and go haul some lumber, and stu -- o-on Shabbos, you know, and a couple of stores had to be opened up, because most of the Jews were what do you call, have stores, or some kind of a -- we -- we -- we were very -- I think about two or three families ha d land. So that was -- and after that, you know, it kind of dwindled down a little bit, but the next Saturday -- it was Friday afternoon. So this guy was a real firebrand, and as far as Jews were concerned. Q: But people didn™t work on Sunday. Christians didn™t work on Sunday. A: I we -- we -- Sunday, by law, you cou -- you™re not allowed to work, okay? So mash -- Q: So whether you were Je wish, or not Jewish, you weren™t allowed to work? Interview with Alan Kalish October 24, 2003 31A: Correct. But we -- we would go work in the fields on Sunday, and we a -- they always used to light us up, you know, the police, but no-nothing ever happened. Nothing ever happened.

I was -- Q: But it wasn™t a big deal? A: It was no big deal, you know, I was -- Q: Was there a party? A: Yeah well, I had a little schnapps, you know, and some cake and stuff like that.

Instead of orange juice, you know, they had a bottle of vodka, you know, and everybody was pouring himself a bo -- a sho -- a shot of vodka. So to be friendl y, I had a shot of vodka before breakfast. So, yeah, that was -- Interview with Alan Kalish October 24, 2003 35Q: And you -- and you were able to do that? A: Oh yeah. Q: And not just go out -- A: No. Q: -- like you did when you were six years old? A: No, no.

I was sent to a trade school, and that was in Munkac. So I went to -- it was a mechanics, and I was there, and you had to go to school also, because in Europe a trade school meant that I have to go also to theory, and you know, general information. And every six mont hs the state would come in and test you, see if you are advancing theoretically, and practically. And if you didn™t, you just dropped out, you couldn™t rejoin. So that™s how it -- it worked. Q: So is this a very long day? Is it the daytime and the evening, or you -- it™s part-time? A: Well, it was dur -- during the day -- Q: Okay. A: -- actually in the morning, it -- it took abou t five hours to go through the -- what do you call, the theoretical part of it. And i-it was really -- you learned a lot.

A: Well they -- ye -- it was -- yes, it definitely was a difference, because the c-city was kind of dull. Munkac was a thriving city, aya -- about 35 - 40,000 people there. It was a Interview with Alan Kalish October 24, 2003 38ma -- a more or less modern city, and all of a sudden it was dull. Everybody was afraid to say anything, or do anything, and it was r eally trying to -- starting to get tough. Q: And was there a problem with you as a Jewish young man going in? A: No, no, no, not at that point yet, no. Q: Not at that point. A: Not at that point yet. Q: Uh-huh. And -- and there™s no -- there™s no particular problem on the farm with -- because you™re Jewish?

A: I mean, we were totally isolated from the world. The only reason we knew what -- a war was going on, because we heard the guns when the Germans invaded Poland. Q: Did you have a radio? A: No. We had no electricity. Q: Of course not -- A: We had no running water. Q: -- right, right. A: We had nothing. Q: So you can™t get news from that -- is there -- are there newspapers, or they™re all censored? A: Newspapers -- not in the town. Q: Not in the town. A: We had to go to Munkac to get a newspaper. Q: I see. A: Munkac -- new -- Munkac had a newspaper. Q: So, when you went to Munkac, did you -- would you buy the newspaper? A: No. Interview with Alan Kalish October 24, 2003 40Q: You wouldn™t, because this was not a traditional thing for you to do? A: No. Q: Uh-huh.

Well, what do you call it, when the Hungarians invaded, was some Jewish military guys, tried to date her. But, you know, dating over there wasn™t like over here, you t -- you date and you take them for dinner, you take them, you know, a movie or sa -- there was no such a thing. So you just talk. Q: And she wasn™t interested. A: She wasn™t interested in talk. Q: Right. Hm. So something radically changes in 1944, I gather. A: Correct. Q: In March of 1944, when the Germans come in. A: Well, the Hungarians -- you als -- the Hunga rians allowed the Germans to come in -- Q: Right. A: -- and take over that time. Q: Because mun -- Munkac is already under Hungarian occupation. A: Correct. Q: At what point does syna -- Cinadova become occupied by the Hungarians, is that in ™43? A: In ™43. Q: And then the Germans come in in ™44? Interview with Alan Kalish October 24, 2003 42A: Correct. Q: So, are things very different in ™43 when the Hungarians -- or not so different? A: Not so different because, you know, we were so close to -- to Munkac, and alla -- and I had to change schools over -- I had to lear n Hungarian, you know, and start learning, and talk Hungarian, learn -- first it was Czech, then was Ukrainian. But Ukrainian was a popu -- a popular area there, you know, was all Ukrainians, so you spoke Ukrainian anyhow because the kids and everything else, even though you didn™t go to [indecipherable] Ukrainian school.

A: No. Q: Even though you were still at school there? A: No, I was not in school Interview with Alan Kalish October 24, 2003 43Q: Uh-huh, by ™44 you had finished? A: Well -- well, wait a minute. I -- I think I still was in school that time. But th-they didn™t -- all -- it happened all of a sudden, okay? All of a sudden they -- that brick factory, they closed it off, and they got it ready, and what do you call it, they started to accumulate people. Q: And -- but you™re living -- you™re going -- you™re still going to school, but you™re living in Cinadova . A: Correct. But we -- we didn™t know what was going on that time, and we heard some rumors that, you know, they are interning sa -- interning some Jews, but nobody made a - you know, no big deal, you know [indecipherable] you know, you didn™t know what to make of it. Q: And you weren™t quite sure what it meant anyway. A: No. And once we got there ourselves, to Munkac, the Germans will tell us that they™re taking us down south to Hungary , all the Jews, and they™ll be farming aw -- give them farms over there, and do th e farming, and live together. That™s what the story was. Q: That™s what they said. But before -- ho-how did you ge t to the ghetto? Who -- who came and got you? A: The shar -- Hungarian gendarmes. Q: They knocked at the door? Interview with Alan Kalish October 24, 2003 44A: Knocked on the door, and we -- and just, pack whatever you can carry, and let™s go. We said, [indecipherable] cows, and animals, you know. Somebody™ll take care of it, let™s go. Took some bedding and stuff like that, and some food, and carry it on our shoulder for about three, four kilometers to the train station, load it up over there. And the whole line was about 15 kilometers, because it was further east. And then Munkac all of a sudden it was about 15 kilometers total to go to Munkac, to the brick factory. And over there was open, just a roof on top. Q: And wa -- wa -- I -- I want to get back to these guys knocking at your door. Who answers? Do you answer, or your mother answers?

Or just -- A: Well you -- you -- in the camp itself, you were able to go around and do whatever you do. I remember the -- being I was knowledgeab le about plumbing, and mechanical, I was able to scrounge around piping and drill a well -- I knocked a well down for water, Interview with Alan Kalish October 24, 2003 49because we had no water.

How were the guards with you in Jawischowitz , were they very brutal, the kapos and the guards? A: The kapos were sometimes worse th an the gar -- than the SS. The SS didn™t get involved too much, only if somebody stepped out of line, then they came in and they really beat you to a pulp. But the kapos wasn™t too gentle either. The kapos are mostly German Jews, prisoners. And they -- they had certain privileges over there, and if a young boy came in, they would have him their house boy. I guess they used them for sex and everything else, so -- Q: Ho -- did -- did you know these we re German Jews, not just German? A: Yeah. Q: The kapos, they were German Jews? A: They were German Jews. They -- they were brutal, most of them. Q: And did you sm-- you assumed that thes e young boys were being used sexually? A: Well, we knew. Q: You knew? A: We knew.

A: I -- if he -- I -- I don™t know how to te ll you, but if he didn™t follow their rules, you know, gave s -- gave somebody leniency or so -- we -- you know, lenient with something or somebody, then it -- because he was walking -- always walking around with a rubber Interview with Alan Kalish October 24, 2003 73hose about yay long, and if you stepped out of line, or he didn™t like you, or whatever, he give you a whack over the shoulders, or over the head, that -- no mercy. Q: So th -- in order for them to survive -- A: They had to -- Q: -- they had to be brutal. A: -- brutal. Q: Did you understand that then? A: No. Q: Do you understand it now? A: Yes, I understand it now. Q: You do? Would you have become a kapo do you think A: No. Q: Did you have a chan -- yo u wouldn™t have done it? A: No. Q: So in a certain way you don™t understand this. A: You try to survive, you try to -- not -- try not to cross the line because you saw somebody who crossed the line of any way possi ble. And was no mercy. And if they had appel -- appel was, you know, a roll call, and somebody was missing, you stood there until that person showed up, and freeze your butt off. And then whoever showed up late, God help you. Interview with Alan Kalish October 24, 2003 74Q: Mm. Did you -- A: Because the German -- the -- the Gestapo would take the roll call. They would go, you know, call out your name, and -- Q: Do you recall about how long you woul d have to stand in roll call? A: Most of the time it was about a half hour. Q: So it wasn™t that -- A: Wasn™t that bad. Q: -- but it™s pretty cold. A: But you -- you worked all night long. Q: Yeah.

Q: So you were able to take a shower every day? A: Ye -- after you come back from the coal mines. Q: With soap? A: Yes. Q: Really, but -- and how did you dry yourself? Was there actually a towel? A: Well, re -- it™s kind of a rag, that -- you know. Interview with Alan Kalish October 24, 2003 75Q: And the showers were large, group showers, I would imagine. A: Group showers, correct. Q: Right. A: And toilet facility was latrines. Q: Mm-hm. Did you have to go outside the barrack for that? A: Yes. Q: Were you able to sleep? A: Yes. Q: You could sleep. Was it very noisy? A: We were tired. Q: You were tired. A: Real tired [indecipherable] you know -- you know, y-you -- you put your head down you went out like the light, and all of a sudden, appel, appel, appel, you know, you get to your feet, and -- a-and you gotta get out and -- Q: Did you have dreams, bad dreams?

Q: And what did you talk about? Interview with Alan Kalish October 24, 2003 77A: About how ya -- how your Polish leader treated you, and who got beaten up, and who got killed, and if you were sick you didn™t dare to go to the infirmary because then they ttake you to Auschwitz, and that was it. So -- Q: So it was a very practical kind of conve rsation about what was --what was actually happening. A: Correct, yeah. Who -- you kn ow, who got -- who was sick, and then who got beaten up, and -- and try -- kind of tried to stay out of l -- out of the way, you know? Q: Alan, tell me something. Now you knew that the Germans were murdering Jews in Auschwitz. Did you also have a sense that they were murdering Jews all over Europe? A: Mm. Q: Or did you -- did you only think about this particular -- A: That time we knew that Jews are being killed all over. Q: All over. Because you™re meeting Jews who are coming from other places? A: Yeah, from all over [indecipherable] a lot of Polish Jews, and -- and they -- they are the ones who are telling the horror stories, whoe ver survived.

And we ge -- and we went, came down to Geneva, and there was a -- a house there, not far from the airport, and I don™t remember the name, but there was ot her refugees, but these -- these were not survivors, these are people who during the war they ran away and this and that. And we were with them, and they were -- some of those went to work, and we went to work also, and we were introduced to a scu -- what do you call it, to the teachers over there, one of them was a Polish Jew, was a -- he was a math professor, he was really good. And then the shop f -- foreman, and we -- we went down there and started to learn. And a couple weeks later, they separated us from that group, and just the survivors got a place there, it was called Hôme de Pregni, right back of the United Nati ons building. And there they also had a psychologist, and they had a house mother, and we went to school, and started to learn. And I -- I requested to get a French tutor for me because I wanted to learn French in a hurry. And once I had a knowledg e of conversational French, I decided to register -- it was for the fall semester, in the community college. Q: Why did you want to learn French? A: Because that was the language down there. Interview with Alan Kalish October 24, 2003 110Q: Uh-huh, okay, right.

I would s -- I was really -- a language I™m really fast to learn. And I went to school, and I still went -- and the tutor still was, you know, teaching me French, and in ORT I was doing very well. And I™ll tell you, they really taught us basics, and precision, how to operate each shop piece of equipment, and that™s what we did. You learn how to do it, and after awhile, they separated the top students, and gave them advanced [indecipherable] and I was one of them, was a few of us.

Interview with Alan Kalish October 24, 2003 118A: Well, yes, but that wasn™t my favorite place to be. Q: It wasn™t? A: No. Because, first of all, I was a li -- stay ing in the living room, and sleeping on the couch. That wasn™t the best situation. I had no privacy, and most of my friends were in Manhattan. So after I don™t know how many weeks, or maybe a month or six weeks, I got a hotel room with a friend of mine in Manhattan, on Hundred Street and Broadway, and we got a room, a beautiful ro om, and somebody was cleaning it every day, and you know, you use the restaurants down there wherever you turned, and I was working already, so I have some money, and -- Q: It was okay?

Did they -- Interview with Alan Kalish October 24, 2003 119A: Yes, my -- really were kind of disappointed that I left, but you know, wasn™t -- wasn™t -- wasn™t my way of living. I was up to knowing there™s a little better things in life than sleeping on the couch without privacy. Q: Right. And what did your fa ther™s brothers do? What was -- A: Well, one of them owned a bun -- a -- a -- a Laundromat, or a cleaning store, stuff like that, and they were pretty well off. And they ™re the ones who sent -- it was 350 dollars for the trip. And they are the ones who sponsored the 350 thousand -- 350 dollars. The other one was -- he was -- you know, those days y ou didn™t have washing machines, so you picked up laundry, and bring it to the laundry, and bah, bah, bah. So they weren™t too well off, and that™s where I was staying, basically. And wasn™t my ideal place, for a real life to live. And moving to Manhattan, there was a lot of other friends that I knew, and was more accessible to places, and doing things, and I ju -- I -- I really did enjoy it much better. Excuse me. Q: Did you go to night school ri ght away to learn English? A: First thing, yes. Q: First thing. A: First thing I did is register to school, and I went to school. And there -- I -- I remember I used to go to work, and -- from eight to 4:30, and I -- it was an old Greek restaurant there, and I used to go there, do my homework. And classes w ould start at seven o™clock, seven to 10, and it was a routine, daily routine. Interview with Alan Kalish October 24, 2003 120Q: And what were you -- what work were you doing? Were you [indecipherable] A: Well, I started off with a s -- first of all -- first job I had was operating a automatic turret lathe. Q: An automatic -- A: Turret lathe.

And the guy who I was working for, only about two or three days, ﬁOh,ﬂ he says, ﬁy-you s -- you can™t leave.ﬂ He was a Greek and he spoke some German, and he says, ﬁYou can™t leave, you™re doing such a good job.ﬂ I said, ﬁI can™t stand here, you know, s -- stand in that one spot doing nothing.ﬂ So I went down there for the interview, and I -- he hired me right away, and now I™m -- so I went to work over there, and he paid me 75 cents an hour, and I did -- you know, whatever I had to do, and one day they were trying to do something, to solder a certain part and a -- it was an al Interview with Alan Kalish October 24, 2003 121-- a lot of them, and nobody knew how to do it. So I said, ﬁI™ll show you how to do it.ﬂ So all of a sudden, ﬁHow about you come in on Sa turday and do all that?ﬂ I said okay. And then they found out a lot of things I was able to do that they weren™t too good at it. So all of a sudden, I™m working overtime, but no raise, still 75 cents an hour. So you -- at school, I -- I talked to all these different guys, one guy™s telling me there™s a company that is hiring, the name is National Equipment, and they told me the address. ﬁWhy don™t you go down there, see if they ™ll hire you?ﬂ So I went down there, and sure enough they hired me, and I was getting a dollar and a qua rter an hour. Making a big money now. Q: Big money, absolutely. A: I make big bucks now. Q: Right. A: So I got the job, and over there I -- I did very well over there also, so they put me with this guy to work.

I says, ﬁMitch,ﬂ I says, ﬁyou don™t have to hide, I know how to do that, it is -- just don™t worry about it.ﬂ So him and I went out on the first job, over the week end, you know, they had some problems [indecipherable] some of the equipment to straighten it out. So he says, oh I can™t -- I said I want to stay in this hotel, and he said, ﬁOh, I can™t stay there, it™s too much money.ﬂ I go, ﬁThat™s too bad. I™m going to st ay there, and you go wherever the flea b -- flea-bit hotel.ﬂ So sure enough he went there that night, I told him we gotta meet for Interview with Alan Kalish October 24, 2003 122dinner over someplace, and he was afraid to order anything half decent. And I just handed my bill in, and he handed his, and I got paid, he got paid, nobody said a word, you know? But he didn™t last long, he died. And all of a sudden I™m the guy who has to go out there on my own. Which I did, and I -- and I remember at one time I -- I was in bo -- they send me out to Boston, and the owners over there look at me, he says, ﬁWhat are they sending children out now?ﬂ Because I was blonde, blue-eyed blonde, and I looked younger than I was, and I said, ﬁI tell you what,ﬂ I said, ﬁYou give me carte blanche, and -- I™ll -- I™ll meet your deadline.ﬂ And he says I -- I -- I says -- excuse me -- ﬁIt™s a deal,ﬂ he says, ﬁIf you do it, I™ll buy you the biggest lobster in Boston.ﬂ I said, ﬁOkay.ﬂ Well, Sunday afternoon I call him up, I say, ﬁYou better come down he re, they™re ready to roll.ﬂ He comes down there, and he said, ﬁOh my God.ﬂ He said, ﬁCome on, I™ll buy you that big lobster.ﬂ Q: So you did it. A: I did [indecipherable] Q: Tell me something, this fi rst year that you™re in the United States , do people ask you what happened to you? Di -- A: Some people, how, isn™t it terrible what they did to you? I says, ﬁPlease, don™t give me that. I -- I went through all that already, so don™t ask me to tell you what happened to me. It happened and it™s gone, it™s for -- forget about it.ﬂ So wha -- Q: So you -- you didn™t want to talk about it? Interview with Alan Kalish October 24, 2003 123A: I didn™t want to talk about it, no. Even with my family or anybody, I didn™t want to talk about it. Q: Why, do you think? A: Because I choke up. Q: Uh-huh. And you still choke up. A: Well, I -- I do high sc hool -- I do schools now. Q: Uh-huh. A: And sometimes I still will choke up, and there wi -- tears roll down. Q: Right. Do you have dreams about it? A: No. Q: No. A: No. Q: Do you not watch movies about it? You don™t like movies anyway. A: I -- I -- I rather don™t. Q: You rather don™t. Do you read? A: Yes. Q: Is it about -- about the Holocaust? A: Well, I read about certain individuals w ho, you know, professo rs who wrote and -- Q: Uh-huh. Interview with Alan Kalish October 24, 2003 124A: [indecipherable] and stuff like that, and he -- he -- how -- how they got through the war, and you know, the -- how this family, I ju st read a book, I don™t remember the name. This family was religious and this one girl there was a rebel, and on and on, and then she met somebody and he was -- what do you call it -- got drafted into Hungarian army, and being he was a Jew, was [indecipherable] so he ran away, he -- and so you know, and then he got -- he never got into concentration camp, but he hid someplace, and -- it was an interesting story. Q: So, when you came to the United States, you certainly noticed that there was a great deal of racism in the United States . Did this make you worry about what kind of a country it was? A: I was -- I had blinders on. Q: You like -- really? A: I had blinders on. And a c ouple of times when somebody [indecipherable] the Jews come over, the refugees come over, trying to ta ke over, and I kind of got nasty about it, you know, and -- but that™s a -- I didn™t make an issue out of it. Q: And did you see from the -- what happened to African Americans, to black people in the United States? A: Yes. Q: Did you wonder what sort of a country this was?

But some of them were really sometimes were more anti-Semitic than anybody else, the blacks. A-And after awhile I lost sympathy because of that. I said here is a -- here are people who are being persecuted, an-and now they™re hating Jews and, you know, it does not -- it doesn™t make any sense. So I lost sympathy. Q: Okay. A: But some of them, you know, a lot of th em were nice, they™re -- they™re qualified. I had -- I had a guy who worked for me up in Horseheads, and he worked in the machine shop, and then I made him a foreman.

We installed a lot of equipment over there, and they couldn™t make it go, they actually got calls all the tim e, this is no good, this [indecipherable] guys didn™t do right, and so I would go down there and find out what their problem is. And little silly things that just -- so one day I said, ﬁYou guys are the biggest dummies in the world,ﬂ I said. ﬁYou can™t figure out what™s wrong over here?ﬂ I says, ﬁWhy don™t you get somebody over here who -- who will show you how to do this?ﬂ He says, ﬁYeah,ﬂ he said, ﬁwhy don™t you come to work for us?ﬂ I said, ﬁI will not.ﬂ So I said, ﬁI don™t want to work for you guys.ﬂ Well, [indecipherable] they kept calling my wife, they called my mother-in-law, they found out where my mother-in-law lives, and bubba, and everybody, they bugging me, you know, to -- I said, ﬁOkay, I™ll co -- I™ll come to work there.ﬂ Meantime where I was working, ﬁOh, we™ll make you a foreman over here,ﬂ and you -- ﬁdon-don™t leave us because you are good wh-what -- what you are doing, and blah, blah, blah.ﬂ So I said, ﬁWell you guys aren™t paying enough, so I™ll go over there.ﬂ And so I went to A&P and I worked over there for about two, or two and a half years. And I read in the paper there™s a job really paying well, it was in 19 -- I think it was in ™52. And I took that job, Interview with Alan Kalish October 24, 2003 133and it was designing and setting up printing presses for newspa pers and magazines. So I went for an interview and I got the job, and I worked there for -- well, I think it was about 11 months. In 11 months I made over 9,000 dolla rs. That time was a lot of money, in ™52. So -- but they then decided -- the union decided -- and I wasn ™t part of it -- to go on strike. And the boss tells me, ﬁAl,ﬂ he says, ﬁafter the strike, we going to have to lay off almost everybody because we lost a lot of business.ﬂ So th en I went out to -- Monday morning I went out for interviews. So I saw there was AT & T, Crucible Steel, and Colgate Palmolive had ads. So first I went to Colgate , with a line up of about 50 people. So I finally got to the line there, and, ﬁOkay,ﬂ he says, ﬁcome on in the engineering office.ﬂ I says -- ﬁand I want you to read this, showing how you would go about it.ﬂ So I said okay. So I went over, and then they br ought me in the plant, and in the machine shop, and how would you handle this, and -- in the plant how would you handle this [indecipherable] . I said, ﬁOkay, thank you.ﬂ Then I went to Crucible Steel, and they did a -- test me also, and I says, okay. And then I went to AT & T, and AT & T was a lab, and they said they would hire me, but that was about two o™clock in the afternoon, I wasn™t too far from the A&P plant, so I went down there, and I went to personnel, I said, ﬁI want to talk to my -- Olie Turgison,ﬂ who was my boss with -- before I left. He says -- so the guy down there says, ﬁHe doesn™t want to talk to you, you left over here.ﬂ I said, ﬁJust call him up and tell him I want to talk to him.ﬂ So he came down here, ﬁOh come on, I™ll buy you a cup of coffee.ﬂ And he asked me, ﬁWhat are you doing?ﬂ I said, ﬁWell I Interview with Alan Kalish October 24, 2003 134think I -- I think I got a job at Colgate Palmolive , th-they pay the most, and they are -- and I feel that™s a good company to work for.ﬂ So he says, ﬁWell, how would you like to come to work for us?ﬂ I said -- I told him what Colgate is paying, and, ﬁIf you guys can meet Colgate™s salary, I™ll come to work for you.ﬂ The next morning, Tuesday morning I get a call at nine o™clock or so, he said -- he - he told me he has to talk to the big boss. He says, ﬁWhere the heck are you,ﬂ he said, ﬁyou™re supposed to be working over here since eight o™clock in the morning,ﬂ he says, ﬁit™s nine o™clock, you should have been here.ﬂ I says okay. So I went down there, and then I got promoted a couple of times with A&P, and that™s when they send me up to Horseheads, and -- Q: And so you were there for a long time. A: Yeah, I was there for a long time. Q: And how did you get to Florida ? A: Well my daughter, younger daughter just finished college, and we were buying the New York Times to look for a job for her, and while I was helping her find a job, I come across -- and there is a job over here, maintenance manager to s -- what do you call it, to run a facility in Florida , Tropicana. So my wife -- I -- I open up my mouth, I said [indecipherable] , I said, ﬁis a job that suits me to a T.ﬂ So my wife wants to know where is it. I said, ﬁOh, it™s down in Florida .ﬂ ﬁWhere in Florida ?ﬂ I said, ﬁBradenton.ﬂ ﬁAren™t you going to apply for it?ﬂ I said no. So right away my daughter starts that, ﬁMom wants to go to Florida , why don™t you apply for it?ﬂ ﬁI don™t want to.ﬂ So they Interview with Alan Kalish October 24, 2003 135worked on me all day long. It was on a Sunday. Finally in the evening, I said, ﬁIf you do a cover letter, I™ll fi -- I™ll make up a resume, and we™ll send it in.ﬂ And who the heck wants a 50 year old guy to run a facility? Well, p.s. -- we dropped it off in the mail on Monday, and Friday morning they called my house, and my wife says y -- I™m at work. Can they call me at work? And she says, ﬁNo.ﬂ she says, ﬁyou give me your phone number, he™ll call you back.ﬂ So I called them back and we had a long -- well over an hour on the phone and they wanted me come down for an interview. And I flew down there on a Friday afternoon, because I told them I™m not going to waste any of my job over here and spend days down there loaf -- you know, goofing off. I said, ﬁIf you want me, I™ll come down for f -- an interview for Saturday.ﬂ So they left a car in -- out -- in -- near the ho -- in the hotel where I was staying, with the instruction how to get there, and I got there, was about nine o™clock, and the interview was over about noon time. I asked can they get me a real estate guy, and they said yes, and they -- I looked around, and I liked the area, and I told them what it would take to get me, and Tuesday I got a call, how soon can you make it?
