Q: And what happened with your father™s business after 1933? A: For several years he kept it, and then Œ then the Nazis took it. Q: I see, so Œ A: And when he Œ and when he came to this country, they got Wiedergutmachung , you know what that is? Q: Reparations? A: Yes. Q: Okay. But that™s a lot later, isn™t it? A: Yes, of course. Interview with Ursula Marx June 8, 2016 35 Q: Okay. So I still want to get a sense of this life in Berlin in the 1930s. Did you see Brownshirts walking down the street? A: Yeah. Q: Were they near your home? A: No. Q: No. Did you ever feel harassed in school, when you were still in school? A: No. Q: Okay. A: I was out then. Q: But when you say, I was out, there were still some years after Hitler was in power Œ A: Yeah. Q: Œ before you were out, and th Œ A: No, I didn™t feel anything particular. Q: Okay, so your teachers were not cruel? A: No. Q: And the fellow students did not Œ A: No. Q: Œ behave differently? Interview with Ursula Marx June 8, 2016 36 A: No, that happens later. Some of my friends wouldn™t talk to me any more. Q: And that was after you had already left school? A: It™s so hard to separate it exactly. Q: Okay. Then it doesn™t matter. It doesn Œ in Œ in that sense, it doesn™t matter. It Œ what I™m after is, the incidents where you experienced them not speaking to you any more, can you tell us more about that? A: It was just Œ we didn™t Œ we didn™t stay in the same places, we just Œ they didn™t walk where I walked, and Œ Q: Would you see th Œ A: Œ they wouldn™t make any attempt to contact me. Q: Okay. A: As a matter of fact, I was on a business trip with my husband, to Germany from here, and I used the bathroom at the bed and breakfast. There was a magazine rack. And one of the girls that had been my friend, and was in school with me, had become a ve ry famous actress. Q: No kidding? A: I saw her picture. And so, somebody asked me, did you contact her? It had gone through my mind, and then I decided not to do it, because I didn™t want to be rejected. I didn™t know how she felt. Interview with Ursula Marx June 8, 2016 37 Q: What year was this that you were in Germany , and you saw the picture in the magazine rack? Was this several decades after the war? A: Oh yes. Q: Seventies, 80s? A: Probably around that time. Q: Okay, okay. And so you never did contact her? A: No. Q: Did the rejection ever come in a very obvious way? A: No, it was subtle. But you know, this is part of my upbringing. My parents instilled a spirit in us that, no matter what happens to you, you™re still yourself. You don™t lose yourself, you don™t lose your value. And that™s what kept us going. Q: Those are very important lessons. A: Yes, very. Q: You know. A: And so I™m Œ you know, we™re so fortunate. Not every child has that. Q: That™s right, that™s right, th Œ the Œ you know, as we grow up, part of our answer to, am I worth anything, is your mirror to the world, and how the world reacts to you. A: Yeah. Interview with Ursula Marx June 8, 2016 38 Q: And at some point, in growth, you have to come to a realization that you have value, despite how the world reacts to you. And that™s something Œ A: Yeah. Q: Œ you™re saying your parents stres Œ stressed. A: By example. Not by lecturing. Q: Okay. A: It Œ it helped me when I came to this country, which is, of course, much later, and we may come to that. Q: Yes, yes. So, did your level of living change much in 1933 to ™36, those first years of Hitler being in power? A: It did later on, yes, because for instance, you couldn™t have a maid any more, that was under 45, because that™s when those Œ when they couldn™t have children any more, and they didn™t want to work for Jews. So we had a part time maid, over 46. Q: I see. I see. A: And our apartment was smaller by then, because my mother couldn™t take care of anything big. And I guess the money wasn™t there either, I don™t know. Q: Okay. Were your parents less Œ how was their manor? Did their manor change, as time went on? Were they less happy? Were they more worried? A: Not to Œ they didn™t show it to us. And it came out when they Œ when we left. Interview with Ursula Marx June 8, 2016 39 Q: Tell me about that. A: Well, it™s a really a long story, I Œ Q: Please, please. A: Okay. Q: Please. A: By that time it was later on, and I did not want to stay in Germany . I could see what was happening. My father kept saying, you don™t have to worry. I™m Œ I was a Œ I have the Iron Cross, I was in the army. They™re not going to do anything t o me. But, course that changed after Crystal Night. Q: Okay, so you were still in Berlin during Kristallnacht ? A: I was still in Œ yes, I was. But before that, what happened Œ no, th Œ I don™t Œ happened around that time, I wanted to go Œ I wanted to leave so badly. And I was a stamp collector at the time. One Sunday afternoon I was looking at my stamps, and I found an envelope that my uncle had given me, that came from America , and it had an American stamp on it, addressed to him, and he gave it to me because I Œ he knew I was collecting stamps. So, he happened to be in our house that Sunday, and I went in there, and I said, who are these people that wrote to you from America ? And he said, that™s my Œ cousin of mine. And I asked him about the details, this couple, they had no children. He was American, and she came Œ had come from Interview with Ursula Marx June 8, 2016 40 Germany . So I said, would you please write to them and see if they would give us an affidavit? And he did write to them, and he did give us an affidavit, my sister Œ for my sister and me. Q: And this is in what year? A: It was probably about Œ it was around ™38. Q: Okay. Before Kristallnacht . Because that™s November ™38. A: I know. I know. Q: Oh, yeah. A: And I™m Œ I™m trying to pinpoint it, and I have not been able to Œ to get the Œ give the exact date. Q: Okay. A: Well, when the affidavit came, you have a quota number. And it was a very high number, there were a lot of people ahead of us. So I said to him Œ my father, I said, I don™t want to stay and wait here and maybe not get out. He had a friend in London , and that friend had a friend Œ an English friend, who was in amer Œ who was a Quaker, a British Quaker. And he told him Œ he said to my father™s friend, we™ve been thinking what we can do for German Jews, and maybe this is something we can do. Maybe we can take one of them. And it so happened Œ you know, life is so strange that way Œ so happened that an American qua Œ the head of the American Interview with Ursula Marx June 8, 2016 41 Quaker was visiting that friend Œ that man in London , at the time, Dr. Balderson (ph). And he was on the way to Germany to find out what was happening. And so Mr. Œ the English Quaker said to him, would you investigate that family, and see if we can take one of those girls? And he did, and I remember when he came to our house, Dr. Balderson (ph) Œ Q: Dr. Borgussen (ph)? A: Balderson (ph), b-a-l Œ Q: Oh, Balderson (ph). A: Yeah, Balderson (ph). Q: Balderson (ph), mm -hm. A: And he came on a Sunday, and we Œ we had already learned English in school, and my mother spoke a little bit. So she made coffee, and we talked. And later on he went back and he told them that our family was fine. So they said they would take one of us. Q: Did your sister want to go as much as you did? A: I guess. I think. Well, we were a pair, anyway. So we send Œ we wrote to them, and we sent our pictures, both of us. And as they told us later one when they saw the picture, they said, we can™t take one, we have to take them both. So we got ready to go. Interview with Ursula Marx June 8, 2016 42 Q: Okay. A: And I™d like to tell you the process of what happened. Q: Please, pl ease. A: Everything we took Œ somebody came from the government, and everything we took, he marked down, and we had Œ my parents had to pay the government the worth of that particular article that we took. In money. Q: Even when you owned it? A: We owned. Q: You owned the article, and yet, if you want Œ A: And yet Œ and yet, they had to pay the amount that article was worth. Q: What did you Œ do you remember what it is that you actually took with you? A: Well, we took all Œ yes, we took our clothes, of course, and we did manage Œ my sister took a sewing machine.

A: We Œ this is another thing that I would like to talk about, is how the process was. Q: Yes, tell me. A: And what [indecipherable] Q: Okay, please tell me. Interview with Ursula Marx June 8, 2016 43 A: You may have heard this before, but I think it repeats Œ most people here, Americans, do not know this. You know, it got worse every year. Q: Yeah. A: And people are wondering, how do Œ did they know which stores were Jewish, and how could they know which glasses to break. Well, one year there was a law that all Jews had to take Œ all female Jews had to take the name Sarah , and all male had to take th e name – Q: Israel. A: Is Œ I forgot [indecipherable] for a minute. Anyway, they had to take these two names. The following year there was a law, all Jewish stores had to write their names on the outside of the windows. You see the connection?

We were quite Œ you know, we were very protected all our lives. Q: And so, Mr. Balderson (ph) visited you after Kristallnacht ? A: I think it was after Kristallnacht , I think so. I™m not sure. Q: And the Quaker couple in Œ in London said Œ A: Took us in. Q: Took both of you. And can you tell me about your leave-taking? A: Yes. Q: You say, first of all, there was the inventory of your things. A: You know, can you imagine parents sending their two daughters away? Not a tear, nothing. Q: Really?
