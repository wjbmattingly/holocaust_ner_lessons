So that the whole country was divided, very, very much divided. But uh many Jews went on, went out from the city to reach the russian border to flee from the Germans but the Russians had uh had closed the border. So they came back. To find in many cases that their flats were taken by Germans or by others. Anyway there was a decision that the after what hap- pened between the, the Jews and the Lithuanians, they would not tolerate that Jews would live in the city of Kovno. And uh part of Kovno that lay on the other side of the river Eleya was designated as a ghetto and all the Jews had to leave town by the 15th of August. And I very much wanted to, to do some drawings of that exodus. but it was really dangerous to, to be in the streets.

Rabbis don't want to be, to be drawn but his son wanted a drawing of me of his father. And it is in, he and uh it came out that the whole family was burned alive. And why was it. Because other sons of the rabbi who lived in the United States and in Switzerland had taken steps to the pope and to all the great of the world to take their family out of the ghetto. But to the Germans, a Jew was a Jew. And a Jew had no right to be treated differently from another Jew. So they burned the whole family.

But here I made a special effort to make it very realistic and i used all my academic training to make it as near to reality as possible, especially when I drew the bridge, I really went into the construction to, to draw it in a manner that if somebody wanted to construct a bridge in a model or something, he could use my drawing as, as a record. I, I did my best you know in those circumstances you don't count any more. Yes. It's the whole that counts.

What you do is the only record we have. And uh as I had a, an academic training because uh I, I went to study in Belgium in a modern arts school that was, was founded by Juan develdha, who was one of the big German uh modern architects. He was already old and he was the director of the school and it was based on modern art. I chose the theater but it didn't give me the training I hoped for, to learn. Drawing and painting. So at the same time everybody laughed at me yes. I went to the Antwerp Royal academy to the drawing classes where they were drawing for a whole week a statue of, of something yes and you had to go into every details, detail. And I stayed there for two years. And if I hadn't done it I could never have uh have done what I did in the ghetto. I wanted to know to draw like Leonardo DaVinci does. He was my ideal. And uh at that time it was the time of the Bauhaus yes and at the time of everything. Burned the Louvre yes and they were laughing at me. But I once uh I visited a lot of exhibitions when I was in Belgium. I really had a very good time. My, my brother was living there.

I was very much encouraged by my teacher and he even uh told my parents that I should leave school and then make a career of uh of art but my parents said first, first finish school, then we'll see. Q: In the ghetto when you were drawing, what did other people in the ghetto think. EL: They came around and they, they were very excited and they said how good you do it so and what can be done so that it is preserved so people will know how it was. This was their expression. Show them how it was. Of course there were people that said that you are doing very dangerous things and then they, there is no, no hope for it to survive and leave it alone and I must really say and say it again that thanks to Avraham Tory, I, I, I held out.

There was a, a man he was he was one of the workers at the, at the organization of Jewish labor. And so he was a collector and once he, he called me and he said that he had a plan. He wanted to create the album of the ghetto. Here, where he wanted to include all the documents that came from the Germans and all the signs and all the uh whatever was printed in the ghetto. And uh to, to, to give them some artistic value, he wanted me to do portraits of all the people who, who had some important jobs. Were about 40 people that I didn't have to worry. He would, he would make the arrangements. He would bring the people to me and 40 portraits. And then one day he calls me look it won't be 40. It will be twice 40 because I, I went to Mr. Tory. He, his name was Golub then. And uh I had to have his help because he knew all the arrangements in the, in the building and, and the people who were working there and I asked him for help so he said well I'm ready to help you on one condition. Everything you do you do double. One for my archives and one for your archives. So he said all right (laughs) I'll do it. There, there were enough papers that, that were double and, and many fold yes but I said no, I won't make 80 portraits. But there was another artist in the ghetto. Joseph Schlesinger.

And he came here and he visited Tory and he visited me and we spoke a lot about Joseph, yes. Pity that he died. I hoped to see him again. Q: Children in the ghetto, you drew some of the chil- dren.
