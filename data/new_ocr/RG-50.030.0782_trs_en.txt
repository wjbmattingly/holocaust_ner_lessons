So that was really happy years. And I was not an angel, because my neighbors of my parents called me little devil of kra Œ kraft Œ Krawiec little devil. So I was little devil. And from little devil, naturally angel cannot grow up angel. So I was Œ when I grew up, I was not angel neither.

Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 5A: Well, I don™t remember, you know, because it was when I was seven, eight years old And Œ but I was Œ I Œ I suppose that I was a little devil. Q: Okay.

But my mother told me, he already is Œ have some problems, and the Œ with his health after those tortures. So they will kill you, and they will kill him, so Œ but then they finally gave him Œ stop Œ stopped to take him.

Q: Was the local priest, you know, the village priest a very influential person? A: Well, it depends. In my time there were two. One was a long time, but he was not very liked. And then next one came a bout two years before Œ two years maybe t Œ yeah, t-two years, t-two Œ three years an Œ before the war. And he was very liked, and he was influential, and Œ and he was completely different than his predecessor. Q: In what way? A: Bi Œ what? Q: In what way? A: Well, he wa Œ he™s Œ he was more with the people, when his predecessor was more of a Ravla(ph) Karszitski (ph), you know. Q: More with the Œ with the landlord, and more Œ A: Yes, aristocratic people, and so on. And Œ and this wa Œ they not Œ successor was more with the people. And I have something to do with that be cause when we came, Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 15I just happened ba Œ I [indecipherable] run into him. And we have a long talk, he asked point blank what happened, because in Œ bishop, they tell him that this Œ that this vil Œ village is qu-quite communist, many communists, which was not true. It was one. But the predecessor, well, that was local problems. There was a Œ the peasant party, and a youth organization, wici(ph), which was quite radical. And the organizer of the wici(ph) became communist. He had some friends in France, and they tend to be communists in France, and they send him some literature Œ Q: And he was influenced? A: And he be Œ got influenc ed, so he became communist. But then Œ and that was the reason the government ca Œ the county office closed the Œ the local wici (ph) organization Q: The youth organization. A: Yeah. And so they got somebody else on his place, and so he was not influential, this guy in the village, really, but that is what happened. And 1935, I believe, there was a problem in the village, because the Œ the landlord had lot of land, and he need Œ and not much machinery. He had already some machinery, but a lot of work was done by hand, by people. So he pay from about a zloty a day, with a Œ with Œ on your own food. So, only a zloty a day. Q: So that™s considered not a lot of money. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 16A: There was not a lot of money Œ well, that was a lot of money, but not enough, you know. Food would cost more than zloty a day, you know. Q: Okay, so Œ A: Œ or at least zloty for food, yeah. Q: Okay, so somebody who would work his land Œ A: So the youth, this organization, although was formally disbanded by the government, but they still existed, and th ey have Œ they have library, and even [indecipherable] them, because they ask me what kind of book to buy, and they have some eve Œ may Œ even some to Œ corre ct money for thing. So they decided to strike. Well, strike, and here is time of harvest, you know Œ Q: In the summer. A: And he need the people to take care of the Œ and the priest, previous one, on the Œ in the church, stated that cris Œ Christ said muts Œ pray and work and pray, something like that. And so, it is cri Œ it is sin to destroy, to Œ to do harvest, you know, God™s whatever. Q: Food. A: Yeah. And so Œ and when he said that from the altar, the young people walk out of the church, you know. Q: Oh ho. Oh ho. Yeah. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 17A: So that became the story that it is communist, you know. So, they were not communist, but they just didn™t like it, and when the new priest came, and I Œ as I said, I just hap Œ by accident I ran into Œ to him, about first or second day when we came, before he even has Œ has a first mass in church. So we talk, and I tell him all about. So he change Œ so he knew how to handle himself. Q: Okay. A: And I was Œ that was ki Œ at the end of vacation, when I was Œ not vacation, but Œ yeah, in summer, before it™s Œ the school started.

Especially intellectuals were quite left wing, to the left bent, and they Œ any those news ab out gulags, you know, and so on, they consider capitalist propaganda against Soviets, you know, against socialism, which is the future of the mankind, and so on. But we know quite a bit, and Polish press publish that quite often. So we had no Œ we had no Œ Q: Was there Œ okay. A: Œ any doubt. Q: In your Œ in Bahuszets (ph), did people have radios? A: No, not at that time. There Œ there have, the Karszitski (ph) have, and then later prop Œ pi Œ pastor have a Œ a radio. Q: Okay, so the Œ the chur Œ the Œ the priest had one, and so did the landlord? Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 30A: Yeah. Q: Okay, but regular people Œ A: Regular people can™t afford it. Q: Okay. A: And beside that, was no electricity on top of that, so you need batteries on top of. Q: Yeah. A: You know. So Œ but anyway, when war break out and occupation, all Poles have to give the radios to Germans. No Pole can own a radio. So this Karszitski (ph), aristocratic family, due to connection with some aristocratic family in Austria Œ because Œ the territory was, before the war, part of Austria. So some of them were even in the Austrian [indecipherable] in parliament. Polish aristocrat, you know, representing Œ because Galicia at that time had already [indecipherable] you know, some Œ Q: You™re talking before the first World War? A: Yeah, be Œ be Œ sin-since ni Œ since ninet Œ 1868, until the first World War. So the Œ through connection with some aristocratic family in Austria, they got permission to Œ to own a radio, to keep the radio. But the village was right on the San River, which was boundary bet-betwee n German and Soviet occupation. Q: Really? Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 31A: So Œ yes, at the beginning, it was. And San River was the boundary. And because of that, the grenzschutz, the border guard, German border guard had a sec Œ have a Œ the group, you know, how many , some unit. And they Œ and they Œ and the Œ and the landlord has two villas, one old, and new. So the Germans took the new villa and family moved to old villa. And it was old, but little Œ maybe little Œ no [indecipherable] from the San River, which was boundary. From the river you can see the Œ the other side of the river with the Soviet guards, you know. Q: Oh really? You were able to do that? A: Yeah, well, across the river, boundary. Q: Yeah. So tell me, where were you on September 1 st, 1939? Do you remember? A: September 1 st, 1939? Q: Mm-hm. A: I was in the military. Q: Do you remember where? A: In Przemy l. Q: And do you remember how you learned of the war? A: About the war, we learn very quickly, about two, three Œ three, four days. About three days before. The Œ the government declared mobilization. So the first civilians, you know, reservists, those who serve two Œ year or two years ago, start to Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 32arrive, but then they started that, because Œ under pressure from France and England, that there is provocation for Hitler, you know. Q: If there Œ if you mobilize. A: If Poland mobilize. Because he concentrated army on Polish border. Q: Yeah. A: You know. Q: Yeah. A: And so that was not provocation, bu t we mobilize. That was not provocation. Q: Of course, of course. A: So Œ but couple days later, they declare mobilization again. Q: Okay. A: And so I Œ and we Œ we Œ I was in the ba rrack in t Œ in town, and we were, all the civilians, we s-send them Œ give them, you know, uniforms, and organized them in section platoons, company and so on. And they, I don™t kn ow when they went. They got orders to go somewhere. Q: Mm-hm. Okay. A: So that was when the war Œ and Septem ber first, early morning, there was alarm in the bar Œ barracks, because they bomb Œ they bomb Lwów , which was 98 Œ about Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 33100 kilometer east, and also some Œ some Œ something at the end of the town, some military Œ this thing, bomb, so, we got alarm. Q: So, the German war planes went Œ flew as far east as Lwów, and Œ A: All Poland . Q: All Poland , even the parts that were later occupied by the Russians? A: Yes. Q: I see. A: They had bases already in Slovakia. They took over before Czechoslovakia . Czechs became part of prot-protectorate they call, of Germany, and Slovakia became independent, thanks to Hitler , you know. Q: And so, what was the Œ what were the first days of the war like for you? What were you doing? A: Well, for me was nothing but we were doing the same thing as before, arming an-and organizing reservists into comp anies and so on, and send them away. Q: Mm-hm. Okay. A: And then was second Œ thir d day, finally we get to the train and went west Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ to the front. Q: So then wh at happened? Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 34A: Well, we Œ that was in the evening. So we get the warning Œ well, first thing, that we stop in many places because the tracks were bombed, so they have to wait until they repair tracks. And we get early morning to Tarnow , so not far from Przemy l, well, about over a hundred two Œ about 200 kilometer. And from there we walk down south, and me Œ me da Œ knowing geography for Œ quite good, we came Œ I because disturbed because already here, so far away from the west Œ west, bombing. But then they got already Slovakia. So they get off Slovakia northeast, and we Œ Q: So German soldiers Œ A: Œ we took Œ we took the Œ our regiment Œ I was that Œ the division. We get on Dunajec River, it was de Œ running from Carpathian mountains north. So we get down to the river, and it was hilly country, foots of Carpathian mountains. So down and dig ho-holes, you know holes ther e, and to defense the river. So when I get there, I say well, that is Œ situation was, we back, from we are so far. And then we hear, very shortly after, artillery, then machine guns south Œ left from us, not too far. So well, I know this Slovakia , I had came from Slovakia and Œ and this is what happened, and that was the first to Œ we tried to stop them, but we didn™t do much, because further they get from Slovakia , they get on our backs. Q: Oh, so in other words, you were fighting with German forces that were coming through Slovakia , to Poland, but they were able even to go behind you, and Œ Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 35A: Yes, because Slovakia was reaching further east. Q: I see. And attack you from the behi Œ from behind, as well? A: Yeah, so it Œ it Œ so we were through next day, and I was in Œ in unit which supposed to slow down the advance of Germans. Q: Okay. A: So to help, give time the units to go Œ Q: To retreat. A: Œ re-retreat further west Œ further east. And at the evening, crossed at the evening [indecipherable] the shooting machine guns, artillery where there was a river, Wisok river, where our units went. And so Œ well, knowing geography so well, there is just Germans get there before we get there, on this. And the soldiers start to run toward us, you know, back. Q: Oh, you mean the ones who were retrea ting are now re Œ running back towards you? A: Coming back to us, you know, we were [phone ringing] Œ we were Œ Q: Okay, let™s stop. [break] Okay, so you Œ before the phone rang, you were telling me that you had some skirmishes, or some fight with the invading German armies, who were coming through Slovakia , but they had circled around and back Œ A: Yes. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 36Q: Œ and so you™re retreating forces, in Œ in the end, ended up running back to you. A: Yes. Q: Okay, then what happened? A: And then, I was in the unit which suppo sed to slow down the main forces, you know. Q: Right. A: C-Coming from west. And so it wa Œ er Œ I was Œ but my druzyna , means section, 18 soldiers with machine gun. Then it was one heavy machine gun, and that was one anti-tank gun. So, a ltogether those three different units, the sergeant was a commander of that. So when the soldiers start to come in, he ask what is going on. So Œ and they said that, our forces were crossing the bridge, when from the southwest, from Slovakia, the tanks, German tanks, machine guns and artillery, start to bombard this bridge. So many people were killed on that bridge. And then panic, on Œ somewhere on this side, didn™ t know what to do. Some try looking for some spot where the river is not deep, so they can walk across. Q: And this is the San River? A: No, that was Wisok. Q: Wisok, okay. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 37A: Wisok. And Œ Wisoka . Wis Œ Wisok and Wisoka , this was Wisoka . Wisok is next one. And Œ and so the sergeant, af ter hearing that, disarm Œ disbanded the whole thing. Go anywhere you want, dest roy the arms, and go wherever you want. And Œ Q: So you didn™t surrender to the Germans, you just Œ A: No, no. Q: Okay. A: Disarm and go wh erever you want. Q: Okay. A: Go home. And so I asked my soldie rs, my 18 soldiers, who came from the villages where we were going, near Rzeszów - Przemy l so, on the way, if they wanted, I Œ I am sure the next Œ next defense line will be on San, and I know the territory, so [indecipherable] go northeast, so we will get there, if night comes, we will get there. All 18 decided to go with me. Q: So you would cont inue fighting on a different location? A: No, not fighting, we were just marching. Q: Marching, okay. A: To get to Œ to the la Œ the defense line. Q: Okay. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 38A: And so we stop, we sleep at ti Œ at Œ during the day, and walk at night Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ because the airplanes. Q: Right. A: But before we get there, there was what, three days, the Œ many civilians from [indecipherable] this was part of Czechoslovakia which was [indecipherable] Poles and Czech in 1918, local, divided this territory according Œ living as Œ as many Poles on Czech side and Czechs on Polish side. So this part, th-they decided this line [indecipherable] river was the boundary, and that was part of west side of the river. But Bene the Œ Q: Edward Bene , mm-hm. A: Œ Edward Bene, the prime minister of Czecho Œ Czechoslovakia Œ Q: Œ Slovakia . A: Œ after the war, he was with Masaryk in Paris, and he has good contacts, and take him Œ Poland was Œ has a problem with Ukrainians, you know, in the east. Then still Germans were in the west, and the Soviets are coming, approaching from the east. So the Œ they has to Œ in the army, that the army was in the west. So they decided and they took this t-to [indecipherable] . And this became, you know, point of Œ Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 39Q: Contention. A: Œ contention, the hard feeling between Poles and Czechs. So, in 1938, when Hitler get the Sudetenland, Poland took this part to the line which they were divided bet Œ b-by Poles and Czechs in 19 18. And they were really good Poles. They were oh Œ ma Œ one interesting thin g, they were not Catholic, they were Protestant. And, on the way when I go ther e, couple hundreds of those young men from [indecipherable] who serve in Czechs army, they Œ wh-when the war break out, when that Œ they wa Œ went to Polish places to mo Œ to get mobilized, to get to Polish army. But they were moving already, because approach mu Œ Germans were approaching, so they were moving. And they were walking, trying to get mo Œ Q: To the Polish side. A: Œ to Polish uniforms, and arms, and fi ght. And Œ but I don™t remember now, 150 to cro Œ close to 200 of them joined me. So I Œ Q: Really? A: Œ yes. And I was walking with unit of 18 soldiers with arm, and everything, and here, civilians, you know. And I Œ this is Œ I get them to the San River. There was a major who take this, my druzyna , my Œ this 18 soldiers away, uniform, and armed. And he got couple hundred civilians like that, walking, trying to get mobilized. And I don™t know how many, four or 500 of them . He told me to li Œ get them to the s Œ Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 40railroad station, which was quite a way. It s took nex Œ one day and next to railroad station to Lublin, and they™d get Œ they will be mobilized there Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ arms, and organize. So this is the way I lost my soldiers, and I [indecipherable] in uniform, with four or 500 civilians, I walked to the railroad station. And next day we get to the stati on, train was waiting for us, and Œ but it take all day, although there was not far, about a hundred, maybe 120 kilometers, but tracks were bombed, so we have to wait until they Œ they fixed the tracks, so we can go back. And we get Œ but by evening we get to Lublin, and we just get off the Œ not on this pre Œ passenger station, becaus e there was not passenger car, but the to Œ no, cattle cars, you know, those bar Œ Q: Oh yeah, yeah, mm-hm. A: You know. Covered, but not Œ not person. So it start in the Œ not in the personal station, but in the station where they unloaded Œ Q: Freight. A: Œ cargo. Q: Yeah, mm-hm. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 41A: Yeah. So, and we just get off this station on the streets, when the last le Œ be Œ before evening, the last air force at the German air force attack, and they bombed this station completely. Q: Really. A: But we were lucky Œ Q: You got through. A: Œ a few minutes before, we left this. Q: Amazing. A: Yeah. Q: Amazing, yeah. A: It was. We were lucky. And it was a su Œ funny observation. So we fell down, you know [indecipherable] you know, we fell down in the street, and against the fence, wooden fence. What wooden fence give you protec tion? But this is Œ this, you know, in there, some feeli ng that you got some protection. Q: Well, you know, the Œ how th e human mind works in panic Œ A: Yes, yes, yeah. Q: Œ you know, it™s Œ it™s Œ it™s crazy. A: And so then, after that, I get this old group, and policeman show me the road to Œ to military barracks. So get there, it was dark already, and the Œ I went inside, we Œ Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 42on the yard, we sit down. And I went inside to report to some Œ some major in charge. So I report to him, and he told me sorry, the Germans cr-cross Vistula River, just west of Lublin, and we are evacuating down, so get your people and walked over [indecipherable]. And I said well, we didn™t eat all day, so can we have something to eat? Well, there is no problem, the kitchen is still working. So we wait there, we get good. That was the last military Œ Q: Meal. A: Œ dinner Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ I get in my life. And it was good one. And so after the supper, the Œ during night, we walk, and by mo rning we get close to Chem. There was some officer, a lieutenant who si Œ directed us to the forest nearby. And in this forest, there were mountains of uniforms, guns, machine guns, artillery even, pieces, brand new, not even used. Still like they were prepar Œ you know Œ Q: Preparing? A: Œ in their [indecipherable] houses. And the other peopl e, and other soldiers, and they were organizing, forming. And so I get to some major; an older fellow. I still remember he didn™t use [indecipherable] but he had just cap, and his white hairs, you know, he see Œ he was fighting during 1920 with the war with Soviet Union , Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 43Poland and the Soviet Union . And so Œ and he Œ he was a really te Œ very ideal commander. And he, fast Œ fast Œ you know, take this stuff, and put down, and grab Œ we have to get fast from here. And lu cky that he did this, be Œ he organize battalion. I became again, commander of druzyna , 18 soldiers. Q: Mm-hm. And so those Œ those two hun Œ A: And we walk not too far away from the forest, and not in column, you know Œ Q: Yes. A: Œ but we spread already. When the air Œ German airplanes start to bomb this forest. Q: Okay. A: So we fell down on fields, and just seeing not too far away, what was going on there. They hid Œ you know, there were many ammunition. So they bomb it, and the ammunition Œ Q: Would explode. A: Œ explode. Q: Yeah. A: And so it was a hell, completely hell. And then we look in our major, and see how smart he is that he push us fast, fa st, fast, you know, we get out. And then I [indecipherable] Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 44Q: Was it Œ was this pla Œ you said this munitions mound of Œ of Œ of Œ of weaponry was in the middle of a forest? A: They bring from warehouses, you know, before the Germans arrive. Q: Okay. And was it visible, do you think, from the sky? A: Well, the forest was Œ it was in the forest, but they can see it as Œ Q: Of course. A: Œ here and there, the ki Œ the for Œ the trees don™t cover Œ Q: Everything. A: Œ completely Œ Q: Yes. A: Œ everything, so they can see it. Q: So it was a great target. A: And they see there are many people around, you know. Q: Yeah. A: So then there we were with th Œ with this battalion, with this major, I was participating in the very, very si Œ hard fight. I lost from my 18 people, I lost six. Q: Oh, that™s a third, yeah, that™s a lot. A: Yeah, but we were fighting until 27. Q: Wow. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 45A: September 27. Q: That™s a long time. A: Yes. We were fighting Germans, and on Œ from the back, we got Soviets. That was somewhere between Zamosc and Tomaszów Lubelski . Q: Did you Œ so, first you we Œ you had this equipment, and you were fighting the Germans, and then when were you fighting the Soviets? A: Well, we were not fighting, because that was Œ they was in the middle of Poland already. Matter of fact, this territory, they were Œ next day they stop and wer Œ withdrew, because they decide to change the boundary between Germany and Soviet occupation. Q: Had you any idea, did Œ you personally, did you have any idea that there had been an agreement between the Nazis and the Soviets? A: No, we didn™t have any idea about that. Q: Okay. Okay. So it must have been a surprise? A: We know that they were Œ between Hitler and Stalin, they were the worst enemies, you know, all the time. Q: Yeah. A: The Œ this anti [indecipherable] pact with Germany, Italy and Japan. Q: Yeah. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 46A: Against Soviets, you know. Q: So it must have been a real surprise. A: Yes, it was a surprise. Q: Okay. So you fought until the 27th of September? A: Yes. Q: That™s a good long time. Wasn™t Warsaw already occupied by that time? A: Warsaw was Œ Warsaw surrendered next day. Q: Twenty-eighth? A: Twenty-eighth. Q: So, what was the Œ what was th e surrender like for you? I mean Œ A: Well, the surrender was like this, our major Œ we were marching during the night, fighting during the day. Q: Okay. A: As I said, I know geography, and I was quite disturbed that we were practically fighting in some unit, same territory, not too far away. We on Œ we get information that we try to Œ back through German line to help Lwów. Q: Okay. A: Lwów was still fighting. Q: Okay. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 47A: And so that we Œ well, but that was too strong, we cannot break through them. So we back some up Œ so then we withdrew, move someplace else, try something someplace else. So that was the Œ our situation. And then finally, one day, to our surprise, at evening, instead of march somewhere, they told us to go to forest and sleep. Na-Naturally, we Œ guards and so on. So, next morning, it was September, you know, a short Œ day shor t already. We get up, nothing happened. So finally officers get out, and in order to Œ company, there was three companies in battalion, plus one platoon of machine guns, heavy machine guns. And we had also one artillery piece assigned to this battalion. So we get on the Œ near the fo Œ out of forest, on the field, organized like in Œ like in a Œ peace time. Company, company, you know? And then the major get to us, and he said just one not very nice word. He speak le Œ to Œ I speak to you last time, and so he says here, you know, what we went, here are Germans, here are Soviets. It was completely surprise to us, that was 27. And then cross the border 17, but we di dn™t know. We were in fight Œ we don™t Œ we had no radi Œ radio, we don™t have press, and ja Œ newspaper, or anything. We were fighting during the day, and marching at night, from one spot to another spot. So destroy the arm, and go home. And at that moment, lieutenant, professional soldier, lieutenant under Œ under [indecipherable] first, at the right side of the co Œ right end of the company, shoot himself, and fell down. And the major re Œ hearing Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 48that, hearing the gun, you know, shoot; turn around and pointed. He is coward. This is the easiest way to do when it™s difficult time, to shoot yourself. We are needed. The war is not ended. E-England and France are fighting. We are needed. Our job is to get home, not tra Œ try not to be taken prisoners of war, but get home, because we will be needed. And so Œ well, we destroy our guns, and then I found out that I cannot put a to Œ written [indecipherable] week or so, so my feet were bang Œ bang Œ Q: In Œ your feet were hurting. A: Hurting, yeah. So I went to some lit tle river, took the shoes off, wash them. My feet were Œ the left foot swo Œ swell, and it was Œ I Œ I was Œ I had fever. I feel, you know, fever, and it was painful.

And they told me that I have to drop this uniform, because they already know from some people Bolsheviks are not far away, and they took all those in uniform, they took Œ they take them Œ Q: They were arresting them?

And Œ and they tell me to go in the forest in [indecipherable] to go in forest and take all Œ and put this, my uniform, in the hole, so they Œ they don™t found in the house. Q: That™s right. A: So I did that, and then I start to walk home. Q: Did you Œ did you get something for your foot? A: Well, I Œ I get from them, they got not much, but I have some friend from military, from this Œ but he was in different regiment, so I don™t know if he return already or not, but not far aw ay in the forest there.

First assignment I had, to organize places where those officers and soldiers, Polish soldiers, who wants to get to Polish army, to France, and through Hungary and Romania. Well, Romania was under Soviet, you have to go to Soviet occupation, and get to Romania, this was impossible. And here was the pi ece from the Soviet boundary. San River was the boundary between Soviet and Germ an oca Œ occupation. From the San River Œ from the Soviet occupation, the boundary, ther e was about 20 - 25 kilometers, direct boundary with the Hungary , and then was Slovakia , further west. Q: So you had a window of Œ A: Slovakia Œ Q: Okay.

So that was this Œ this piece where we have direct contact with Hungary, although Hungary were also with Germany. But there were tradition of friendship between Poland and Hungary . So, we always had good relati on with them. And in this case, they also proved that. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 53Q: Okay.

They were simply not home when Gestapo came to pick them up, but couple other people were arrested by the Gestapo. So, in the very is Œ tough winter 1939, very large snow, several feet of snow was on ta Œ on the Œ so Œ but in Œ my ples Œ my parents came Professor Westfall(ph) from Œ I remember his name, even, although I saw him once in my life. He was over 50, and 36 kilometer in this snow rode Œ he came 36 kilometer walking, because there was no other transpor tation, to tell me that Œ to Œ to Œ to notify the Sarnok (ph), the Œ the end of that Œ what happened, and so on.

A: So I didn™t know the name Œ real name of the person, or where they live, or anything. So then I Œ aft Œ shortly after, th ey came to conclusion that because the Poles have completely cut off the rest of the world, they were German Œ allowed to publish newspaper in Polish language, bu t there was German propaganda. Now the Poles have to turn radios. Our Œ it just happe ned that this aristocratic family, thanks to the connection with aristocratic family in [indecipherable] they have radio.

A: Well, there was special machines, you know. Powiela they called, I don™t know what is the English name for that.

So Œ Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 58A: [indecipherable] Q: Œ were you assigned this task, to Œ A: I was assigned by the Polish underground. Well, I want it Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ you know, to Œ to begin with. Q: You™re a journalist, yeah. A: Yeah. I was dreaming to be journalist, you know. Q: Okay. A: I started to write [indecipherable]. And so that was Œ that was not much journalist because you just copy Œ you just type the news Œ Q: Right. A: Œ you know, from radio, and things like that. But anyway, it was something. And I have couple people helping me from the village there, including my younger brother, 16 years old. And in August Œ Q: So this is going Œ A: Œ the village became quite Œ well, it was practically impossible. One thing, I lost tons of information, because the German concentrated army of war against Soviet Union . So the villa in this aristocratic family was taken by the German officers.

Q: I-I want to interrupt for one minute though Œ one second. You say from Œ you were operating this new Œ little newsletter from January to August, is that right? A: Yes. Q: So that would have made it August 1940. A: 1940, yeah. Q: Right. And you™re saying the Germans were already preparing to attack the Soviet Union in August 1940?

Q: [indecipherable] head. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 68A: And I faint, first time in my life. So they dump some cold water on my face, keep me in Œ drag me down to the same cell I was hanged before, and threw me into cell. Q: Did they string you up again? A: No, just Œ Q: They just left you there. A: Œ took Œ just threw me in so I fell down floor, was concrete floor, and I don™t know, I sleep, or I was lo-losing consci ousness because I was waking up, and down.

And so na Œ night again, and next day brought Œ brought me breakfa st. And after breakfast they walk me upstairs to the same room I was there interrogation, same people. And Œ but they don™t Œ before, they don™t ask me even to sit down on floor, like this you Œ you get to the Œ and some military sergeant from milit Œ German military walk, and look at me and told no. So I don™t know what was going on. And after that, they took me back down to the same cell, and shortly after, four other prisoners, they brought Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 69four prisoners. And one of them was in much worse shape th an I was, you know, beat and wounds, broken. Back he ha d broken like Œ he had cut across Œ Q: His back. A: Œ the muscle, you know. And that was Œ that was Œ he was in pain because that was infected. So all the time Œ fi-fi-finally it broke out, so he got little relief for day or so, and it t-turn over again. And so he walk in and he says pardon me [indecipherable] you know, you re Œ you remind me somebody. Q: This man who had been so tortured Œ A: Beaten and tortured. Q: Œ beaten. Okay. A: But he says, we cannot Œ I cannot talk because this guy at the door, he is with them. So, when they took this guy to deliver food in Œ to prisoners, you know, in other cells, he told me, you remi nd Œ you look like Polish ranger from Sarzyna who two or three weeks before, shoot and kill the deputy chief of the Gestapo, in Jarows aw, from Jarows aw. District of Jarows aw. So that was the explanation. I just look Œ happened to look like this guy who shoot this ch ief of the gest Œ this is the reason they torture me so badly, because they thought that I am the guy who killed deputy chief of the Gestapo, you know. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 70Q: And so this Œ this man who had been so tortured, thought that y Œ do you think he has been the one who identified you? A: No. Q: No. Okay.

A: And now Œ so I know that, and the Œ just that they™re saying Œ next day or so, we were in the cell, and we hear beating somebody Œ somebody c-crying, you know. Q: Sc Œ right, screaming. A: Œ and screaming, and they dragged so mebody Œ and across our cell, was Œ was storage, empty storage for coal for winter. Q: Right. A: So in June it was empty. So they dr ag him there, and th ey were pounding him there, and he is screaming; his moan, it was weaker and weaker. So finally they drag him out. And shortly after, that was si-s ix o™clock, or seven o™clock, they bring us something to eat. So this guy went to deliver the food, and when the Gestapo guy Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 71opened the door, he was sweat, and says this : he was strong Pole. He got 300 lashes, and he is still alive. So this is all what Œ how Œ how they counted, I don™t know. Q: Okay. A: But anyway Œ but next morning this guy went to deliver breakfast, and he said that when he return that he help get the body out, he died during the night, this guy. So after that Œ you know, I got here false identification. Now they will check, because they occupy this territory. So next problem is [indecipherable] next day they call me up. And again, sitting on the floor, pounding. He threw this identification card in my face, and he says [indecipherable] who are you? And again, we had story with my family and my friends and my relatives, that I dated some girl, and father don™t like that. And we quarrel with father on that. And one day after quarrel I pick up my things and I walk away. Q: Okay. A: They don™t know what ha ppened to. So I told this story Œ oh I Œ they did check later, but probably they didn™t believe it, because they keep me there, and ev Œ I went through about four interrogation, or fi ve. And the new prisoners, they walk in, they ask sa Œ they got my picture, they took my Œ they di dn™t get my pictures, I was again instruction, if we™ll got pictures, get away. And shortly before I Œ I Œ I was arrested, I took all the pictures, including the pictures wi-with my diploma, Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 72graduation from high school. Matura, you know [indecipherable] with the picture. I took this away to some relatives far away. So they didn™t had any pictures, but they make pictures, and they sh Œ there™s Œ new prisoners walk in, and Œ and I Œ and they tell me, oh Œ because [indecipherable] Q: Who is this? A: Œ they show me your pictures, you know. Q: Okay. A: Œ I know you. Well, nobody there Œ from them knew me, because I was not working in this territory, I was little further away. Q: Okay. A: So nobody knew me from the underground in this pa rt of the town Œ of the county. Q: Okay. So Œ A: So this is Œ Q: I have a Œ I have a Œ a question that I want to clear up.

So Œ so Œ and th e Germans announce that all those who were Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 90freed have to return back Œ report back to jail. Well, he didn™t. And he was in the tavern, and they got Œ some of them, they got pictures, you know. He must be some murderer or something, because those big criminals, they have pictures.

And this guy was armed, and killed the po Œ German policeman. Well Œ [phone ringing] Q: Okay [break] Okay, so you were talking th at you were transported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. A: Yeah. Q: But before we get there, I want Œ oh, and then you were telling me about mass executions of Poles Œ A: Yeah. Q: Œ and that a Polish criminal had shot a policeman. A: Yeah, and next Œ next morning, they came to the town, get all people Œ small town, it was some Œ at that time, it wa s, I don™t know, fi Œ 1500 of people or something. Suburb of Warsaw Œ building, it was new one. And get out, and pick up hundred young men, and in front of the fa mily, they shoot them , as a revenge for Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 91this one German was killed by Pole. And that happened in many other instances, like that. Q: So you™re saying it didn™t matter th at they had no evidence against you. A: Oh no, there was no need of evidence. They pi ck up people in train, for example. I was couple times, but my false identifica tion helped me. And false identification that I worked somewhere there. In Radom , about 10 o™clock at evening, the train from Warsaw to Kraków, and I was in the train. The train stop in Radom, the both sides of the tr-tracks were policemen, the Polish blue policemen, and German policemen, and the Gestapo line up on both side, all people out. And they walked through the wag Œ the cars, and make sure th at everybody get out. And they walk us to some school, on outskirts of the town , and next day they have Gestapo, and somebody else they got, they check and th ey release those who are working in the town, because Radom has factories, armament factories, so the Œ many people work before the war, so the Germans naturally used that Œ worked there. So the Œ and then Œ well, I was hesitated what to do, I was not sure if my identification card will be good enough, you know. So, there were people as Œ still some people left. And there was one Polish woman who was Œ she claimed that Œ well, they pe Œ they Œ she is prostitute, she got Œ she got the, you know, card that she is prostitute. Well, she got [indecipherable] she got child. Her husband is in Œ in Œ in camp, you know, Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 92prisoners of war camp. And so Œ well, by ev ening I came to conclusion that I have to Œ cause there was a Polish policeman, this blue policem an also sit Œ standing in the Œ there was like a hall on the other side, was a room on both side of the rooms. I was in one room, and the Œ in the middl e they got like desk, and there was G-G-German Œ Gestapo and so on. There was the Germans Œ Gestapo, and also the Polish priest. And so I talked to her, I give d her some money, and that™s so she will go to Œ get to this German policeman, this Gestapo guy, get with him and nice Œ Q: Friendly, mm-hm. A: Œ friendly. And in meantime, I ran out of the room. I know this Polish policeman wouldn™t Œ so, naturally they opened the door, was slide from the room, in the dark, on the out. So natura lly I didn™t walk Œ Q: Right. A: Œ around straight, but to the side so th at they won™t see me. They shoot, but then I jump at the fence and get Œ but there was poli Œ eight o™clock, police hour. Nobody can be on street. Q: Curfew, yeah. A: You know. So Œ and I hear from the corner the policemen, two policemen arrive far Œ not close, but far away already, walk on the street. So, it was restaurant, so in night the door around to thi Œ this restau rant, but it was locked. But I got Œ I was Œ Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 93and door open, and was woman. Polish wo man, Polish restaurant. And she opened the door and Œ Q: Let you in. A: Yes, first in, you know, close the door. And so she said, I hope that they won™t Œ they don™t see me, or Œ Q: Right. A: Œ walking in, or something, because they were shooting, but nobody follow me Œ Q: Right. A: Œ because I disappear in darkness, a nd I turn, you know, street into another street, and Œ and so they were having a dinner, full dinner [indecipherable] They have another English name. Q: But Œ but why were these people taken from the train in Radom ? Why Œ was it just a Œ a random Œ A: They just Œ that was Œ those who were working for important ni Œ German industry, were release of orders, went. Those not educated went to work on farm, or in the factories in Germany. Educated usually to concentration camp. Q: I see. So you™re saying it was all random. A: All random. Q: Random.

And so I went to Rzeszów, I had friend in the village, across to Rzeszów , the town over 20,000 people. And I sa ys, well, I need Œ Przemy l was closer, but Przemy l the more Œ majority of the town, and this old town, and the business town part of the town was under Soviet occupation, and the German occupation was smaller and more just residential part. So only Rzeszów was there. So [indecipherable] and we went to Rzeszów, and to Œ because he was in high school in Rzeszów , so to the store, where he bought, when he was in high school, you know, par Œ papers and pencils and whatever he needed. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 95Q: Mm-hm, supplies. A: And that was a ze Œ Jewish store Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ Jew owner sa Œ Jew owned the store.

A: Œ using balance. I pick up, and I want pay, and this Jewish fellow says, I think I know for what is that, I won™t take money. Yeah, honestly. And I get from him later, they close him, the store. So he carries some the stuff to Œ back. So before they lock the ba Œ ghetto, so we walk Œ I walk with my friend to him, he got in the back, in his kitchen. And so I always ge t how Œ how long he had something, I get the paper without money. He didn™t took money. Q: And what happened to him? Do you know? A: Well, he was in ghetto. I suppose they all get killed. Q: Mm-hm. Did your activities ever take you into the ghetto? Did you have any assignments? A: No, you can™t get into ghetto if you don™t ga Œ have special permission.

They Œ they get out, and in underground press, information about Œ ther e were some pictures of children dying on street, especially in wintertime. Frost and not dressed w-warm, and so on. So we know the condition in the ghetto very well. But it Œ it was locked, and it was surrounded by wall, and barbed wi res on top of the brick wall. Q: Which ghettos did you see, from which towns? A: Well, from Warsaw. Q: Oh, you saw the Warsaw ghetto? A: Yes. Q: Okay.

Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 98A: We know very well what was going on during ocup Œ occupation, because in spite of all this security the Soviets have, we still have some Poles who sneak through and get on the German side. So we knew very well. Q: Okay. A: Matter of fact, I myself, with special assignment, I cross the river at night on the other side, and I was lucky to get through and get to whom they send me. And then, two or three days later, get back on the German side. Q: So you crossed the river San? A: Yes. Q: Okay. What kind of assignment was that? A: That was dealing with espionage.

And Major Ruskaivich(ph) has a unit Œ has espionage unit, besides the Polish underground, independent from th is. Well, he told me it is the Polish underground corps, and the espionage cooperating with British. And the British agent who is in charge of all that, he™s on the Soviet side in Przemy l, under condition that he share with Soviets, the information, you know. So fine, because they know that we were strongly anti-comm unist, anti-Soviet. So he know he was afraid Œ so Œ and he need me . And so I started to be part of this espionage business, in between, between Œ before I started to publish the paper, again, and so on. And so I have some friends from military, various parts. So I traveled to them Œ he got money, so Œ I need money to live, so th at was a good set-up for me, because I get money to live.

And situation is bad because they found he was Œ some dollars on him, and something else. So Œ but now some other people, you know, brought the material and we should caught that and send this somewhere. So Œ and she got all this material.

And you cannot go where that was narrow, wa Œ th-th-the water was low, so the pe-people Œ people walk, or even wagons, you Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 103know, go across, because the Œ because that was the very strongly, by the police, you know, because they didn™t know that people walk there.

You know, when I get on the other side, to get to crosses the first guard Œ Soviet guard, I have to tell him, you know, this coat, or whatever it was. And now Soviet guard. So, I Œ loud, I start to Œ loud, you know, ca-call. And I get on the road, and car appear. Well, it was good car with NKWD Œ KGB and other s Œ Q: NKVD. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 104A: NKVD, yeah. So they grabbed me, you know, I was wet, and did I Œ know that I came across the river illegally, and so on, and I got this. So they get me to Œ to the building where the Œ before the war was Polish police station Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ you know, in [indecipherable]. And they get me out Œ th ey get this Œ all this stuff out, this [indecipherable] there were maps, there were information, and it was all wet, so they put, you know, to dry, and they get me , whoa, I™m spy Œ spy, I go yes, I™m spy. And I get this code, you know, to them. Q: It doesn™t say anything. A: No, it doesn™t mean anything. But they st art to Œ and they Œ they start to call somewhere. Well, it was because that was the secret police that [indecipherable] in this Œ but this was group, the military Œ Q: Right. A: Œ espionage. Q: Right. A: So they didn™t had contact with. They didn™t like each other. Q: Ah, the regular KGB didn™t like the GRU. A: GRU, yeah. Q: The mil Œ the military, mm-hm. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 105A: You know. So, but finally they get to somebody, and after Œ and they, you know, in Œ get tough to me. And I was thirsty, I was hungry, and I was shaking, you know. Q: You™re cold, mm-hm. A: Cold, because I put the wet pants on me and wet shirt, and so finally they got some [indecipherable] and they came to me. They took me, they bring me blanket, you know, and they got hot te a, and Œ and so on, and vodk a. And so finally a fellow came with leather jacket. Q: Okay. A: And he give me this coat. He wa s not British, he was simply Soviet GRU military espionage chief for this part of occu Œ German occupied [indecipherable]. So on this Œ a Polish fellow in Przemy l, the deputy chief of this Mila(ph) Ruskaivich(ph) Œ Q: Right. A: Œ he didn™t told me that. So I was, at the beginning I was sure that I will Œ I waiting for British. Q: That™s right. A: But it give me something you know, that is something fishy here. So I didn™t tell them, you know, that I was just re peating the Œ the code, you know. Q: Okay. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 106A: And not telling him anything else, not as king anything else. And so finally they found this guy, he was not any British, he was Soviet military espionage chief. Q: And did you then talk to hi m, once he gave you the code? A: Well, he get this all, and he Œ so, he was ov Œ he was very sorry that Mila(ph) Ruskaivich (ph) was arrested, because his wife and children were on Soviet occupation, because the mo Œ Major Ruskaivich (ph) was assigned on the border with Soviets. And so he was mobilized to the fr-front line, so he was on western part of Poland, but his wife and two children was left in the [indecipherable] Q: Soviet area. A: Œ before Œ before the war they lived in town near the Soviet border. And this Œ this NKGW, he said, oh I forgot, sad mission to tell wife that her husband was arrested by Germans. So now that™s ex Œ ex Œ also explain why my rish Œ Major Ruskaivich (ph) get into this business, to protect the ho Œ Q: His wife. A: Œ the wife and children. Q: Well, that™s what my thought was, that in some ways maybe they were hostages. A: Well, they were at Œ hostages, but to some degree, you know. No, they would probably be transferred to Siberia, but they stay, and they need to eat, you know, so Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 107they have to get some supply. So, because of that, they were living pla Œ practically normal life. So what happened after that, I don™t know. Q: But this is interesting, that the Polish underground was supplying, or at least this general Œ this general was supplying intelligence to the Soviets on the other side of the river. A: Well because, as I said, that was the reason, because he tried to help your wife Œ Q: His wife. A: Œ and children, you know. Q: Yeah, yeah. A: After all, he has said, even Œ and we believe that, that after the Œ during the first World War, the war between countries which partition Poland Œ Russia, Germany and Austria, the war between them, between Austria, Germany and Russia bring the Poland independence. So we felt that if this can happen, so we be Œ we Œ we be Œ we trying to do something to convince So viets, and you know, so th-they get fight Œ start to fight among them selves, because we came to conclusion that would be good for Poland. So that was Œ you know, life is very complicated. Q: It is complicated. So you sta Œ so they Œ at some poi nt they let you go back on the other side? Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 108A: Not just go back, they organ Œ I stayed there two or three days, because they have to check something on me, and check this material. And after about three days this guy came and says, it is very Œ he sa ys, it looked at the German are preparing war against Soviets Œ not him Œ don™t sa y Soviets, but Socialist Republic, you know, and so on. And I say Œ I said, wi-wi Œ from this information we get, it looks like that, because more and more troops is in Œ practically in the village Œ in many villages. Farmers™ villages are full of military units. So they don™t come there for Œ Q: Fun. A: Œ any other reason. So Œ and buy he d Œ we do n™t believe, and Stalin don™t believe that Œ that will happen. And Stalin didn™t believe to the last day. But the grou Œ the military units Œ Q: The military Œ A: Œ got the information, so they were very not happy with the possession of Stalin, but they cannot do anything about it. Q: So this is the military intelligence units? A: Yeah. Q: The GRU. A: GRU, yeah. Q: Yeah. And so they come, and they Œ they™re then convinced that you are fr Œ Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 109A: Then Œ and so he come Œ he says, you fine [indecipherable] I was ba Œ three days, maybe four days even. So one of th e fine Œ I was Œ start to worry, you know, what will happen, that [indecipherable] . Oh, they put me in the house across, on the street [interruption] Q: Okay, so you™re starting to worry what™s going to happen, will they let you go? And then? A: Yes, and the one evening he come, and we drove to the certain spot, and he get off the car and he™s Œ tell me, lay down here so nobody will see you, as we were close to the river. And he says, we have all Œ look at. There were every mut Œ I don™t know, 10 - 15 meters, Soviet soldier watching the other side. And they watched the German, on the other side Germ ans, where they are. And he says, in proper moment, you see Œ you see, this is boat here. There was a guy from the other side with boat on this side, and when th e Germans guards were far away, we cross. So I crossed the river on boat, to the house, which was Œ he got some contact with them, because they told me to stay in this house until morning because Œ Q: Right. A: Œ police hours at night Œ Q: Right, curfew. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 110A: Œ you know, curfew. And so I stay in this house, and the Œ they got like Œ well, not in the house itself, but like before th at, cover with some walls and so on, entrance to the house, and they got nice soft place, so I just lay down there and [indecipherable] Q: And you slept. A: And I slept til morning. And in morning Œ oh, and I get some money from there. But the Polish money, this silver 10 dollars Œ 10 zlotys before the war, which were still good in German occupation. And so I was very happy, this is the reason I could not walk, you know, they brought me across w ith the thing. So I left part of this money over there, because I would look Œ Q: Funny. A: Œ funny, suspici Œ when I walk out of place where I stay, to my friends. And I leave part of Œ with them. When Œ I leave for them also for the service I got. And then the rest I bring to [indecipherable] to this deputy chief of this unit, and I give him and he is give Œ give me some, and took, I don™t know for whom he or else he get for himself. But anyway Œ and that was the end of my espionage work. Q: Interesting. A: Interesting. I tell you Œ Q: Really interesting. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 111A: Œ the bi Œ the little devil cannot be [indecipherable] Q: So, what language did you speak with them? Wi Œ in Œ with the Soviets over there? A: In Polish. Q: In Polish, in Polish. A: Yeah. I don™t know Russian, so Œ Q: Okay. Okay. A: Th Œ and they didn™t know German. Q: So, I think we™ll break right now. [break] All right, before the break, we were talking about your arrest Œ A: Yeah. Q: Œ and that you were Œ you were not released, and that it didn™t matter that there was no evidence against you, that it was very arbitrary, very often. And you were taken from your prison to Auschwitz -Birkenau . A: Yes. Q: Tell me about that journey, and how you got there. A: Well, journey is very simple, the cattle cars, loaded, like fishes in Œ in Œ in Œ inside. Well, the distance was not too far, but it take just about a day to get there, because the Œ the wa Œ this car was not priority you know, in the train they stop for Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 112some reason, put on sa Œ tra Œ side tracks, and so on. But we get there, I don™t know what time it was because we got no Œ no watches. But it was Œ we left morning, it was early afternoon. And so well Œ the Œ Q: What™s the first thing you see? A: The first thing? Well, first thing, we walk Œ at this time they s Œ they built this railroad station in Birkenau, but shortly after they open already so the trains get to the station and the people walk directly from the Œ for us we get to Auschwitz and from Auschwitz, like on trucks they dri-drive us to Birkenau, and then unloaded us, and is Œ is usually everything Œ we drop everythi ng. Well, we were nude, we walk to a shower. So, luckily they put a Œ they took us to shower, not to gas Œ Q: Chamber. A: Œ chamber. And so they Œ Q: Were you in civilian clothes, or were you in prison clothes? A: Yes, in civilian, in civilian clothes, yeah. So we drop everything, and I don™t know, first we Œ they put tattoo number, I think. So the prisoners put tattoo number here, here, or here; it depends on the SS officer on Œ on Œ Q: On duty? A: Œ in charge, yeah. Q: Okay. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 113A: So well, mo-most of them Œ most of prisoners have here, or here Œ Q: Where do you Œ A: Œ but I got here. Q: You have here? A: Yeah. Q: Can you roll up your sleeve so we could see? A: Yeah, sure, yes. When I go to Holocaust Museum and stood in si Œ this is the best [indecipherable] so I go there with si Œ a shirt with sm Œ short sleeves. Q: Uh-huh. And that™s your tattoo number. A: Yes, 153156. Q: Any way Œ could Œ move like thi Œ yes. A: Yeah. Can you have the picture of this? Q2: Yes, I have it. Q: 153156. Got it. Thank you so much. So that™s where yours was stamped, not inside here, but on your arm Œ A: It depends Œ well, all prisoners have here, here, here, or here. Q: Okay. A: You know, it depends on the officer SS, who was on duty. Q: How long does it take to get tattooed? Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 114A: Hm? Q: How long does it take to get tattooed? A: Well, it does not take long time. There™s just tattoo, like some others they have nice girls, or Œ or boys, or something, yo u know. Same thing, ju st the number, so it does not take too long. And Œ but the Œ what was very painful was shaving, because the Œ also prisoners shave us from head, all the way down, with ma Œ never sharp Œ you know, we™re all bleeding because the Œ it was not Œ Q: The knives weren™t sharp enough. A: Œ not sharp enough. And so it was very painful to Œ shaving was painful. Q: What happened after that? A: Well, after that, we go by, and they throw the Œ the sh Œ you know, sh Œ the parents Œ but they didn™t had Œ in Birkenau they didn™t had this Œ this uniforms, you know, just civilian clothing. So I get jacket, which was Œ Q: Too Œ too small? A: Too big. Q: Too big. A: I could Œ I could probably reach to th e back, you know, and pants was Œ were good, and so Œ and then in Buchenwald , when they transferred me to Buchenwald , the Œ we get over there this uniform, this Œ Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 115Q: Prisoner uniform. A: Œ prisoners™ uniforms. Q: Okay. So there you are. What month of the year did you Œ were you shipped to Auschwitz? A: End of September, or be ginning of October, 1943. Q: So that meant you had already been in ca ptivity about four or five months, since May. A: More Œ May Œ May 22nd. Q: So it would be May Œ June, July Œ A: June, July, August Œ Q: Œ August, September. A: Œ September. About four months. Q: About four months. A: Yeah. Q: Yeah. And what happened after you put on the clothes and Œ and the Œ and the jacket Œ A: Well, they s Œ they s Œ to Œ brought us to Œ to barrack. Q: Okay. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 116A: And that was their special for Œ for quarantine, you know. So it was in this qu-quarantine field. Because Birkenau has the fields, each field divided from each other by regular fence, a wire fence, you know. And Œ Q: Did you see other prisoners there? A: Well, yes. They were Œ Q: Not just from the cattle car, but ones who had already been there, yes? A: Yes Œ no, well, dif Œ as I said, the fields were only fence, so Œ and there was no guard or anything, so you can go to the fence and talk to the fellow on the other side. So Œ but on one side there were Gypsies, so not much Œ from all over the Europe whatever Œ whatever the languages they talk, I didn™t know. On the other side I don™t remember even wa Œ what field it was. So Œ and I spend there three weeks, and after three weeks, instead of go to different field, or to Auschwitz, they transport me to Buchenwald . Q: Oh, so you were in Auschwitz just for three weeks? A: Just for three weeks in Birkenau. Q: In Birkenau Œ A: And that was this extermination camp for Jews and Gypsies. There were four crematoriums working 24 hours a day. Fifth was built, and the gas chamber, and the whole families from trains, from this ghetto cars, were simply drived there to Œ to Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 117gas chamber. They told them that they are going to take shower; instead of water, was gas. Q: Can you Œ d Œ when you were there, do you remember seeing those crematoria? A: Well, I see them from apart, you know Œ Q: Distance, from a distance, but did you know what Œ A: From a distance. Q: Did you know what they were? A: Well, sure we know, because they were all prisoners who were kapo, you know Œ na Œ da Œ well, not kapo, the kapo was at work, we were not working. But block leader, and the stubendienst Œ well, in Auschwitz they call schreiber in Buchenwald they call stubendienst. They were working Œ they were not working hap Œ they working in barrack. The block le ader, he was the head of the block, and his helper, schreiber they called, secretary, or stubendienst in Buchenwald , would take care of cleaning the barrack when we go to work, bring food at the evening for us when we return from work, so we s Œ the soup was there already, a-and so on. And clean the place. So they were old prisoners, so they know a Œ so Œ and when Œ when wind blew from crematoriums in our barrack, we had smell Œ burning, characteristic odor, smell. Very characteristic Œ flesh, burning fles h. It was different smell than normal, you know, something bur ning. So we did know at the beginning Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 118what Œ why there is different, so they told us; this is the burning flesh, smell of burning flesh. Q: Wow. A: And so Œ so we saw the Œ I saw from not too far, was maybe not even half a block through the pour Œ to this ramp wh ere they get these prisoners, this Jewish families, and walked them to Œ get th em to gas chamber. So they said Œ Q: So you saw some of t hose families being walked? A: Oh yes, from not Œ really not too far. I said not half a Œ not even half a block. Less than that. Women with babies in their arms. Some young children, small children hanging to her mother™s shirts or you know, or father pants. Q: And you already knew where they™re going? A: Oh yes, we know. You know, that is something Œ so I was very glad when they took me, you know, to Œ that we are going some Œ that I am going somewhere. Not alone, but with the Œ hundreds of others. We didn™t know where, but w-we Œ I wa Œ I was glad that I get out from this, I won™t see any more, yo u know, those whole families going into gas chambers. Especially those other prisoners who work there. They got commando called Canada Œ Canada. Q: Okay. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 119A: I don™t know why, because they were very good situation, because when the transport came, they got some bad jo-job. T hose still alive get out, and they have to Œ to trans Œ the train came from far, from Greece or something. Was three, four days on the road. So they go in and pick up dead bodies, old people and children die in those condition. So get those dead bodies. And those who get out, sometimes the whole transport go directly to gas chambe r, sometimes they make selection, and pick up young women, young men, mor Œ less often women, more men, to work, you know; young, strong, healthy. Q: Did you see any of these selections? A: Well, from afar, not Œ Q: From afar, from afar. A: Œ close, not close. Q: Yeah. A: So Œ but they Œ they si Œ this Œ a ll prisoners, you know, who work over there, they told us what is going on. So is Œ they said that sometimes parents went to gas, and daughter and son, young, strong, stay in the camp, and parents went to gas chamber. Well, they didn™t stay in the camp to work long enough, because in the condition and the si Œ physical and mental Œ you know, knowing that the parents are dead already, they didn™t stay too long, they Œ not knowing food, they get weaker, Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 120and when they cannot work hard enough, so they follow their parents to gas chamber. Q: The people who Œ the peopl e who were older prisoners there, were they Polish as well? A: No, they were all different nationalities. In Auschwitz majority of them were Poles, yes. Q: Okay. A: In Buchenwald, no, but in Auschwitz majority were Poles, because for quite a while Auschwitz was camp for Poles. According to history, and I read somewhere, the first transport to Auschwitz, th-they Œ when they opened the camp Œ because Auschwitz was, before the war was military barracks. They were two floors -- buildings Œ brick buildings, you know. So they just build later crematorium, and some other things they n eeded, surrounded them with barbed wires, fence and towers with for Œ with guards with machine guns and so on. Q: Were you Œ when you were being transported, did yo u Œ did you know that you were being taken to Auschwitz? A: No, I didn™t know. Q: You didn™t know. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 121A: I don™t know where. They get us from Tarnów to train, and this is it. I get Œ when we get close to Auschwitz I knew station, so I thought that maybe we are going to Auschwitz, and we went to Œ to Auschwitz . Same thing later to Buchenwald , I didn™t know where we go, but I know geography, so on the Œ on the way, the towns, you know, we pass [indecipherable] I don™t know if I go Œ we go to Buchenwald , or to Dachau , or some other camp in Germany. Q: Did you know the names of these German camps by then? A: Yes, we knew some name. Dachau we knew. We knew Buchenwald . There was Sachsenhausen near Berlin. Q: That™s right. A: And Œ no, and Œ and Auschwitz. So we knew already, especially in underground we know, we got some information. We have some prisoners who escape from Auschwitz, and Œ Q: Had you met any of the prisoners who escaped? A: I didn™t met them, but they were in the ungra Œ underground paper, you know, the condition Œ this situation over here, what it is there, and so on. But when I get there, I still came to conclusion that I Œ I know very little. It is impossible in wars, to describe the ca Œ the feelings, you know. This barbed wires, this guards, those SS Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 122men with the dogs, and those prisoners. Many they call Œ they call them Œ oh gee, remember Œ the Œ well they Œ it will come to me. Q: Okay, okay. So, what kind of work did they have you do during those three weeks in Auschwitz? A: Oh, three weeks nothing, we didn™t do anything special. That was quarantine. Q: Okay. A: They wi Œ we did not left the camp. Q: Okay. A: So the block leader, who was German, in this case Œ in my case, when I was Œ he was German political communist, they said. The stubendienst, I don™t know. He was, I think, green, because we had triangle. Red triangle was political prisoner. And there was letter P for Pole, R for Russian, you know. And then, on this triangle, below this triangle, was a number. Q: So you Œ the number that was on your arm was on the triangle. A: Yes, also here and here. Q: On your pants Œ okay. A: Here was also just the number, nothing, no triangle there, but Œ Q: Okay. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 123A: Œ but here triangle. Then recognize Œ criminals had green triangles. That was Œ we recognize that is a criminal prisoner. Now, the religious, by Œ those jude Œ Jehovah Witness, and some other sects who refused to serve in military, so they got purple triangle. Q: And was everybody in your barrack s with the red triangle with the P? A: All red Œ red triangle. Well, the first Œ at the beginning in this tra Œ in the Œ in the mar Œ matter of fact, in Buchenwald too, there were barracks Œ block, they call it, nationalities. There were few blocks in Buchenwald , there were a few blocks Poles only. There was also one block for Jews in the Œ in the camp there. Q: In Buchenwald, or Œ A: In Buchenwald, yeah. Q: Okay. A: And they said that there were some engineers, you know, ve ry high, technically educated people, and they need them, so this was the reason they keep them there. Q: Okay. So after the quarantine Œ and that was to make sure that you didn™t bring in typhus or something? A: Yeah. Q: Mm-hm. After the quarantine, one day Œ A: Well, they pick up us again, put in the train, and we went. I don™t know where. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 124Q: Okay. Okay. A: Well, I was lucky that I get to Buchenwald , because many went to Austria. Q: Mauthausen? A: Mauthausen. Which was bad because they got stone quarrel main work there. Q: Yeah. A: So the work was very hard. They got stone quarrel in Buchenwald too, but this was one of the commande rs, not the large one. Q: So tell Œ A: And there were many others. Q: Œ tell me, when you got to Œ did you recognize geographically where you were? Could you see through the cattle car? Was there a window or something? A: Yes, when we were going Œ I remember Nysa . There™s Nysa now in Poland . That is partisan Poland after the war, Nysa, Nysa . So, and the po Œ the train stop there, and some people, Germans, because that was German territory already, some people on the station waiting for train, were talking Polish bandits, Polish bandits are in the train. Q: Ponish(ph) bandyta . A: Ponish(ph) bandytin (ph), yes. Q: Ponish(ph) bandyta . Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 125A: Ponish(ph) bandytin (ph), exactly. Q: And Œ A: So I hear that from there, through the Œ and I didn™t feel bad about. Q: [laughter] Okay, so you knew you were in Nysa , in Germany. A: Nysa si Œ well, I didn™t know where we are going, but when we get Œ we get in Weimar, from the railr Œ from the station, and we walk, then I came to conclusion that we are probably going to Buchenwald because Buchenwald™s just north or Weimar. Q: So what train station did you go to, the Weimar central train station, or to a special one that was close to Œ A: No, we Œ the regular Œ regular station, that you don™t Œ don™t have extra trains, other e-extra tracks. Q: No extra tracks to the camps themselves? A: No, to the camps they have, but to Buchenwald Œ and Buchenwald is on Œ on the slope of a hill. Q: Okay. A: So the train thi Œ can™t get Œ can get close to it, but not to the Buchenwald itself. Q: Okay. And what did it l ook like as you were going from Weimar to Buchenwald ? What was Œ Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 126A: Well, pe Œ nice territory, this Thuningen (ph), central Germany. And Weimar Œ and Œ and Buchenwald is sort of Œ Weimar is just south of Harz mountains, which are very nice Œ nice range of mountains in Germany. And Buchenwald is closer to mountains than Weimar itself. Weimar is well known, dred Œ German [indecipherable] spend a lot of time there, in Weimar. And so we walked from Weimar to Buchenwald east, about seven or eight kilometers. And at that time Buchenwald was not very bad camp, because th at was 1943, at yet the end of September or beginning of October, because they need workers. They built Œ outside of Buchenwald they built 12 factories, 12 holes [indecipherable] each one Œ in each hole they work Œ they Œ they produce something else. Majority of this pla Œ of the holes were produci ng something for the military. Q: And so, when you got Œ A: So, it was th-the holes were Œ they built barb wires fence same as around Buchenwald , and around the constellation camp, and with everything else. And so in the morning when they opened, when we supposed to go to war, the guard took position in those spaces where they supposed to be, and they opened the gates, and we walked to [indecipherable] the holes where we work. Q: And what ho Œ wh-what ho le were you assigned to? A: I didn™t work in this, cause I worked someplace else. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 127Q: Okay, where did Œ A: I work for the b Œ for a while inside the wooden Œ I split the Œ the Œ this part with the roots, you know, of tree, which is Œ Q: The trunk of the tree. A: The end of the tree inside, you know, and cut here. So they brought over there, and my job was split them and Œ in small pieces, so those other guys with saw, they make it wood for burning for whatever. Q: Okay, so what you had to do was split the trunks of trees? A: Yes. Q: Okay. And this was Œ A: That was light work, you know. Q: Well, it™s not like lifting stones, that™s for sure. A: But it was very hard. Q: Was it? A: Well, sure. I learned na Œ for example, I na Œ I didn™t know that. I would think that Œ that the Œ the hardwood, you know, it is hard to sp lit. And Œ but the reverse is true. Hardwood is easy to split. Your make little strength, and they got special steel and wood thing, you know. You make in this group, steel Œ this Œ I don™t know the na Œ E-English name for that. And you h it with the hammer two or three times, and Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 128it wents down, and split little more. So make bigger thing, and then you take larger, or even wooden thing, and you hit with heavy Œ Q: What instrument did you have to use? A: Well, the regular Œ no Œ Q: Ax, or hammer? A: La Œ hammer. Q: Hammer. So you had a hammer to be able to split the wood, but no axes or anything like that? A: Well, there were axes to help, you know, sometimes, to start, you know. Q: To start the process.

Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 129A: Well, the barracks very wooden Œ they were wooden and they Œ in Œ in Buchenwald they Œ well, Auschwitz was brick, because that was former military barracks. But Buchenwald was built, so they have Œ they have few built brick bil Œ two floor buildings. But majority were bar-barracks, you know, long building, and in the middle Œ in the middle bi Œ in the building was entrance, you know, gate, and there was room and across was washroom, you know, toilets and things like that. And on both side of Œ from this all were large rooms, sleeping people. There were three Œ three floors Œ Q: Three levels. A: Œ three levels [indecipherable] you know. So Œ and just narrow spaces between, and again and again, I don™t know, it was 5-600 people in one barrack. Q: That™s huge. A: Yeah. Q: Did you sleep on a bottom bunk or a top bunk? A: No, I was on top. Q: And which was the better bunk to have? Did it matter? A: It does not matter much. Q: Okay. Okay. And since there were five or 600 people, were Œ did Œ were they of all different nationalities in that one barrack? Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 130A: No, usually they have together, as I said, Poles, they have few barracks. So I don™t know how many thousands of Poles were in Buchenwald . There were a few thousand Poles in Buchenwald . Q: Were there Œ A: And there were Czechs, who were before us, you know. Q: Were there any Soviet prisoners of war? A: No. Q: Okay. A: No, they were in Auschwitz only. Q: Well, you see bu Œ what Œ I™ve been to Buchenwald Œ A: Yeah. Q: Œ but of course, in the 80s. And yes, in the late 1980s, when it was a memorial. A: Mm-hm. Q: And the whole Œ when I walked into th e memorial Œ I don™t know if you™ve been back Œ A: No. Q: Œ but when I went into the memorial, the whole place where the barracks had been was all level. There was no Œ no buildings left. A: Oh. Oh. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 131Q: But there were a few buildings on the si de. And one of them was a Œ one of them was supposed to be a doctor™s office, but it was a trick place. It was a place where you come to get a medical exam, and you ™re standing high to be measured, your height measured, and instead, a little circle opens up at the back of a person™s neck, and a gun is stuck in and then they™re shot . And when I went, in the late 1980s, they said this is what was done with Soviet prisoners of war. So if you Œ A: Well, maybe later, when I was not Œ Q: When you weren™t there. A: Because the Buchenwald was bombed in August 1944 , and we lost the work there. They bomb all those Œ Am ericans did very good job. Q: Ah, they bombed Buchenwald Œ A: They bomb Œ bomb all the factories, but not the Œ our barracks. Q: Oh. A: So they did very good job. And so we lost the wor-work, so they transfer us to different camps. So I landed at the end of Œ again in September ™44, in Bad Gandersheim , about a hundred kilometer further west. It was a huge hole, and they supposed to build airplanes. So Œ Q: Mm-hm. So you were in Buchenwald almost a year. Not quite Œ A: Yes, yes, yeah. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 132Q: Not quite a year, okay. A: Well, that was branch of the bo Œ Buchenwald , so it Œ it was part of Buchenwald . Q: The place that you went to Œ A: Bad Gandersheim . Q: Yeah. A: Bad Gandersheim , yeah. Q: Before we get to there, is Œ so did you spi Œ was your work the whole time you were in Buchenwald splitting these trunks? A: No, no. No, I Œ all Œ all different kind of work. We know from underground, you get to Auschwitz, say that you are a gardener, because they got large garden, vegetables and things like that for SS. Q: Okay. A: So that other people work there. So I had that. Well Œ but they transfer me from Auschwitz to Buchenwald , and in Buchenwald , garden was very bad place to work. Q: Oh really? A: Yes, because Buchenwald is in slope over hill. Q: Okay. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 133A: So, it is bad soil. Q: Okay. A: Yellow clay mixed with sand. And now, working in Œ what I got? The whole under shoe, you know, this whole wooden shoe Œ Q: Right. A: Œ no stockings, no [indecipherable] even, because I had nothing Œ Q: Right. A: Œ you know, barefoot in this wooden thing. And then li Œ November, December [indecipherable] rain, wet Œ Q: Cold. A: Œ clay turn into mud, and we carry the s Œ fertilizer, the Œ all the canals get to the place where they Œ filters, you know, and this clear water run through some creeks, some Œ a river, and this heavy stuff left th ere, they put in the Œ they would have wooden box, quite large, in the middle, and two wooden, big, heavy Œ Q: Handles? A: Œ handles. One guy on front, one in the back, and two of us. They loaded this box with the foot, and we carry this, you know. Q: The manure. A: The manure. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 134Q: The manure, okay. A: On the Œ on the fields, yeah. Q: Oh, please sit down, please sit down, okay. A: On Œ on Œ on the Œ on the fields, you know. And sometimes quite distance. And here, the mud, you put Œ y ou Œ you get Œ you try make next step. So you pull your foot out, but shoes sta Œ that wooden sti Œ shoe Œ Q: Stays. A: Œ stay in the mud. So, you have to put Œ start back Œ put back, and it is Œ was going like that. So I get my s Œ foot he re, so mix up, you know Œ not mix up, but wounded, it was Œ Q: Infected. A: Œ infected. And so I landed in hospital, an d that was interesting too, this hospital. Q: Yeah, tell me, what does a hospital in Buchenwald look like? A: Well, they Œ at the beginning they didn ™t have much hospital, but as I said, because they sent the workers to mil Œ they mobilize workers, German workers, so they need to replace them, they replace them with prisoners. So that was the situation, that condition were much easier than before. So Œ so finally I got this very Œ I could not put the shoe Œ foot in the sh oe, so they send me to a hospital. There was a barrack like our barracks, large room. I don™t remember now how many g Œ Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 135how many beds there were, f our, five Œ 10 Œ 12 beds in the room. And there was head of the room, he was prisoners too, Cz ech. They said that he was male nurse from Czechs™ army, okay. So, that evening Œ so first time I was in bed and sleep good, and although this pain bothering me. Next m Œ next day he walk around and come to me and says, well, what you got here? Well, let™s go. So we went to next room. And next room was operating room. There was a table. On table was paper like the butcher shops have, you know, white paper. There was some prisoners earlier down on this paper, and other pris oners operated Œ was digging something in his belly. Q: Oh my goodness. A: Yeah. Q: Oh my goodness. A: So Œ and this guy tell me that this operator Œ prisoners Œ he™s the best surgeon in Œ in Prague , capital of Czechoslovakia ; a professor of the university, and professional Œ it™s a good surgeon. But prisone rs, and with primitive con Œ situation, conditions. Q: Right, no now Œ no pain killers. A: No pain killers, no. So we walk by and ne Œ he put me Œ he stop and talk to this surgeon for a while, and then he come to me Œ well, we sit Œ we sat at the end of the Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 136room, and then he come and put me Œ and he said, you know, he will be with this Œ digging this belly for a couple of hours, so if you want, I can do this to you. Q: Okay. A: [indecipherable] I was in pain, you know, infection and si Œ fever. Go ahead. And so he Œ he pot Œ put me Œ set me on chair like they have in shoe stores, you know. Q: Oh yeah, mm-hm. A: You know, it™s Œ chair. And then he walked back and talked to the pri Œ to this surgeon Œ to the doctor, and came back and he brought ice pick, jar with some fluid, a scissors and paper bandages, because there was no other bandages during the war, no cotton in Europe because blockade, American and British navy you know, don™t get any Œ don™t se Œ don™t Œ they cannot bring any cotton, or coffee, for example. Coffee were Œ were gold in price in Œ in Œ during the war. So, he came and he says, are you strong, he asks me. I said, oh, I think I am. And he look at, I have many marks you know, after beating, the tortures. So he says, well, put your hands Œ and I was sitting on this chair, it™s like shoe stor e, in the back. And he says, don™t touch me. Even if it™s very painful, don™t touch me. Okay. So I gi Œ I was sitting like that, and he put Œ and he hit with the ice pick, you know, hit this Œ Q: Infected area. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 137A: Œ infected area, and stick Œ and make hole and took scissors in, and [indecipherable] . I got big marks here after that. And it was release you know, because the stuff start to run out, and I fe el Œ felt release. The pain was gone, just about. And Œ but when he fina lly Œ this Œ the stuff really run down, he put some dish on the bottom, and when he start and get Œ th is was in this jar, it was alc-alcohol. And so when he Œ this cotton Œ not cotton, but Œ Q: Paper bandages. A: Œ that pe Œ pe Œ piece of paper bandage stuck there, and start to clean, well that was pain. It was painful. And then, after he cleaned, he just bandaged. No sew, nothing, no stitches, nothing. No in Œ nothing, nothing, just Œ just Œ Q: Paper bandage. A: Œ cleaned that Œ cleaned that and paper bandages and that™s it. And it Œ it get together Œ Q: So how long were you then laying in the hospital for Œ A: I got no Œ I Œ I don™t remember. Not too long. Q: Not too long? A: Yeah. And after this, they put me to split those Œ Q: Ah, okay. A: Œ you know Œ Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 138Q: To split that Œ A: Œ that Œ Q: Œ so that you w Œ A: Œ that was the re-convalescent job, you know. Q: [laughter] So that meant that you didn™t have to go in that muck again. No more gardening. A: No more gardening, yes. Q: No more gardening, okay. A: Yeah. Q: And then what Œ did you have any other job? A: Well, I have Œ well, if you Œ they Œ once in a while they send me to Œ to here, to there. Nothing s Œ no, ne-neither one was any special. Oh, the most important. Later, I get as a Œ as all prisoners already Œ in Buchenwald there was two lagers, two camps. Main camps and small camps. Sm all camps, there was few barracks for quarantine. And they were separated by fence. By the regular fence, not Œ Q: Barbed wire. A: Œ barbed wires, and no ga Œ ga Œ guards or anything. Only there was a door leading to it in the Œ in this fence, and there was one prisoner on duty checking permission to Œ from the camp, to small camp. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 139Q: Okay. A: Why? Because the small camp was quara ntine camp. New prisoners. And I, for example, once in four weeks, they re Œ ke Œ in Buchenwald , they send postcards to the families. It was important to notify family that I am alive. Another one they can get Œ we can get parcels from re Œ families to Buchenwald . So, not a very important thing with all this Œ Q: Right. A: Œ not enough food and so on, everybody was getting skin and Œ bone and skin. Q: Sk Œ yeah. A: And Œ and so it was important. So I fe lt the pa Œ the Œ one margarine Œ before breakfast we got piece of bread, and one margarine, in a regular Œ regular Œ you know, one margarine, this thing. So it was important to save some piece of bread and piece of the margarine for noon, because at noon you will Œ we Œ we were Œ we were getting half quart of Œ supposed to be coffee, but there was no coffee. Ersatz coffee, that™s terrible. So it was important to have piece of bread to work after noon. At the beginning we didn™t know that, because everybody Œ there was not too much, this piece of bread for one Œ Q: Person. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 140A: Yeah. For breakfast. And so Œ but [indecipherable] and so this piece of margarine was 25 cents on the black market, and the postcard was four pfennigs Œ 25 Œ not cents, but pfennigs , the German Œ no, German, pfennig Œ Q: Yeah, pfennigs, pfennig . A: Œ yeah, pfennig , 25 pfennigs . And postcard was four. So I give the four margarine for postcard. Q: Wow. A: This is the way they handle, you know , black market. And that was tho-tho-those guards were to protect us from wi Œ di Œ from, you know, getting advantage from us, but didn™t work much. But anyway, after some Œ near the end of Œ before this Œ when they bombed Buchenwald in August, I was already working in Œ inside in the ga Œ in the camp, and I just watched thos e airplanes bombing with very big smile. Q: Now, you said there wa Œ was a Jewish barracks, as well? A: In Buchenwald there was one barrack Jews only. Q: And they were privileged Œ not privileged, but they were Œ A: Not privileged. This way Œ Q: Œ but they were kept because they had skills. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 141A: Yes. This is wh at they told us [indecipherable] other prisoners, you know, older. They were longer there, so they knew more about, that this is, they are skill workers, and this is the reason they keep them there. Q: Okay. Did you have any contact with them directly, or were they separate? A: No, we had no contact, a nd they warn us other prisoners, don™t get in touch, because if the Germans notice, you can be in trouble. Q: Okay. Were people dying a lot? A: Well, they were dying. They™d get beaten at work by prisoners, other prisoners. So there was a system, unhuman system, that human kill other humans. Prisoners kill other prisoners just to survive. Q: How did Œ how did killing another prisoner help somebody survive? A: Well, he was vorarbeiter , or kapo Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ you know. So he didn™t work. So that was great advantage. Even if he don™t get more food, or anything, but at least he doesn™t have to work. So, he has more chances, you know, to survive. Q: Okay. A: But he have to do the job. Naturally, they were, majority of them trying not just to look when kapo is coming, so work hard er, you know, we know that. So we did. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 142Well, the kapo went and we Œ you know, again. So that sometimes vorarbeiter was watching, not to get in trouble himself, but at the same time he didn™t push us any hard. He got this wooden stick, but he didn™t use. But there were some who did. Same thing was kapos. Kapo had three, four groups, and he walk from one group to another, you know, to check on the vorarbeiters and we work. And he also was armed with wooden stick, and he used that quite often. Q: So you™re talking a four Œ A: Majority of them were German criminals. Q: So a four arbeiter was like a foreman of that unit? A: Foreman of the group. Q: Of the group. A: Twenty-eight Œ 25 gr Œ people wo rking, doing same job, you know. Q: Mm-hm. Were there Œ A: Being s Œ let™s say, digging ditch for Œ for s-sewers. Q: Were there any women in Buchenwald ? A: They were separately. Q: They were separate, okay. A: No, they were Œ they were not mixed, no. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 143Q: Okay. Okay. The sewers, were the sewers being built for the camp itself? You said there were sewers Œ A: Yes, for Œ for the camp, yeah. Q: Okay. A: Well, there was Œ in Buchenwald there were approximately 30,000 prisoners. Q: Huge. A: Sure, sure. Q: Huge. A: So they were about thousands SS, the Œ the brick barracks, two, three floors were the SS guard live. There were also several hundreds of them. Q: Did you have contact with them dir ectly, or mostly your contact with Œ A: No, we have no with this contact. The only contact we have with them, when some Œ when we wer Œ go to work, and so me of them best Œ beast Œ work on side, and with the gun, hit us in the Œ in the Œ in the [indecipherable] Q: Yeah. A: Œ in the si Œ on the side here. There were some like that. Q: Were you ever hit in the side like that? A: Yes, I was. Q: Were you beaten? Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 144A: Not beaten, no. Q: Okay, okay. Were there executions? A: Yes, there were execution. They hang those who try to escape, and there were Œ and the Œ and were caught, th ey were hang publicly so we all see, as don™t do that because this is what will happen to you. Matter of fact, in Auschwitz Œ no, in Birkenau, when we get to Birkenau, the first head count, you know, at [indecipherable] they pick up as two Œ two SS officer walk in front of the column of the barrack, it was bi Œ I said 600 or something like that people, and point out raus, raus. And there was a to Œ fellow Œ friend of my Œ my father from next village. And we were standing together. On the other side I have a friend from tar Œ from high school, you know, on the other si de. And he pointed over at us, and we both try to get out, and he says älter raus. Older Œ Q: The old one. A: Œ old one raus. So he was old Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ because my age Œ he was even proba bly older than my father. They were working together. He go Œ was Œ he next village. He was coming to my father because they were in Œ in the co-op Œ cope Œ cope Œ milk co Œ Q: Cooperative. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 145A: Œ cooperative, yeah. And so he get out, and they take about 10 of them, and [indecipherable] us to turn out near Œ they walk them near a fence, and shoot them there. And the SS ca Œ ess man Œ this officer came to us and says, this will happen to you if you try to escape, you Œ you disobey our orde rs, you don™t work hard, and so on. Q: Charming. A: Yeah. Th-This was welcome to Auschwitz-Birkenau. And I wrote about that in Œ under the title, welcome to Auschwitz, to Birkenau. Q: Welcome to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Did you have a similar welcome to Buchenwald ? A: No, no. Q: Okay. A: No, Buchenwald at that time, as I said, it was not as severe, and as bad as Auschwitz still was. Because they build those factories, and they need people to work. Q: Okay. A: So the regime was the same, the food and so on not more, but at least they didn™t beat people without reason and then kill them, or anything like that. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 146Q: So remind me again, what were the kinds of things those factories were producing? A: Well, all different kind of military things. One I Œ I know one was producing the wooden part to a gun, you know. It was wooden shop producing this for a gun. There was one producing the cases for radio. And there were some parts for Œ some milit Œ for some other sa Œ there was one barrack inside the camp, who also only people with high technical education work ed there. They didn™t know what they were doing. Later, we learned that th ey were producing part to this A1, A2 th-they shoot on London , you know. Q: Oh, the V2 rockets. A: V Œ V2 rocket Œ rocket. Q: Okay. A: Part of Œ Q: Part of it. A: Œ that, not Œ not the whole part. Q: Yeah. A: Not the whole rocket, but part to the rocket. Q: Interesting. A: Yeah. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 147Q: Interesting. Did news Œ was there a well-developed information network among the prisoners? A: No. Q: No. A: In Buchenwald was underground Œ u nderground organizatio n, but completely by communists. Q: I see. So they Œ did they Œ A: And it was nobody try Œ if anybody try with Œ without them, very quick they transfer him to someplace else. Q: So you found it Œ A: And this happened to me, too. Q: Oh really? A: Yeah. Q: Tell me how that happened. A: Well, I Œ there was many Poles, you know , in several blocks. So we came to conclusion that at least maybe we can some ways get some information and publish weekly bulletin about the information, if anything else. So I started that with few other people, and we get one Œ few copies only, without some information from Œ thr Œ through radio, from [indecipherable] we got some people Œ some fellow who Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 148worked in the office. They got radio and so on. [indecipherable] combination. And this first few copies we pu Œ po Œ po Œ get in, and shortly after, I was on the list to be transferred to Bad Gandersheim , to branch of Buchenwald. Q: So where Œ how did you distribute th is few pieces of Œ of Œ few copies Œ A: Through friends, you know. Q: Through friends, okay. And so Œ and so they didn™t really want you there to write up the Œ A: Well, the communists Œ Q: Right. A: Œ have monopoly. They don™t want have competition, you know. Q: So you found out where the power was, who had the power. A: Yeah, well. Well, because there were many German communists you know, in Buchenwald . Q: Yeah. A: And even their lager leader, they got so called lager leader Œ not in Buchenwald , in this Bad Gandersheim where I was. And this lager leader, who was a German communist. Q: Oh really? A: Yeah. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 149Q: Okay. So what did you do in Bad Gandersheim ? A: It Œ Bad Gandersheim we supposed to build Œ well, first we built Œ they have no Œ there was no camp. Now 200 came from Buchenwald first transport, I was in first transport, and then more. All together there were about 550 of us. Majority of them were fra Œ Frenchmen, Italian and Russian. And then later, from Auschwitz came about 50 Poles and few from Buchenwald, so all together was about 55 - 56 Poles, but were hundreds of Italia ns, Russians and Frenchmens. Q: Okay. A: And so first we have to build our barracks, our camp. They put us to sleep in old monastery from medieval™s time, which wa s not used as monastery, because the territory became Protestant, completely hundred percent. Q: Okay. A: So this monastery was practically barn; the landlord, large landlord used this as Œ for hay, straw, and things like that. So we sleep there and build our barracks, and dig ditches to Œ to get sewers, water and so on. Q: Okay. A: So, we get there in September, and I think lend of Œ end of December, we moved to our barracks already, from this old monastery. And so then we supposed to build airplane. There a was railroad and on little higher, and on this slope of this Œ from Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 150regular to the land here, ther e were boxes with machines. Milicz air Œ air Œ air pl Œ air factory Milicz Œ Q: Milicz. A: Œ in Poland , built just before the war. Open, I think, in 1938. Q: Wow. A: And naturally Germans t ook over, they use it. But when the Soviets army were approaching, they get all these men to all the machines, and send them to Bad Gandersheim , and they built factory to bil Œ for build airplanes. So we supposed to build the airplane, but first we have to build our barracks, our camp, o-our sewers an-and everything else. Then one group get those boxes, and install in the hole, the hole was ready. Then they we re barracks like long and Œ but brick buildings, not too far away, next to this factory, where the German masters live. Civilians, you know, electrician, whatever what they need, professional people to help, you know, in this Œ to build this factory. And so we installed those machines and Œ and so on, and then we, sometimes in winter we start to build the airplane. There was no Œ someplace else they bra Œ bring the mortars, you know, for Œ and we build just this thing, but we didn™t finish it, not even one sa Œ April fi rst. Instead of go to work, they decided that we walk to Buchenwald . Q: From Bad Gandersheim ? Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 151A: Yeah, about hundred or more kilometers. Q: How much Œ many Œ how many kilometers was it? A: A hundred, maybe more. Q: Oh my goodness. A: Yeah. Q: Did you Œ now, did you Œ was there ever any sabotage of this kind of manufacturing? A: Well, what kind of sabotage would Œ can we Œ Q: Okay, just asking. A: We mi Œ we didn™t Œ didn™t build even the airplane. Q: To sabotage it. A: To sabotage it, no. Q: Yeah. Okay, all right. Okay, so then you™re on this walk from Bad Gandersheim to Buchenwald . A: To Buchenwald . Well, when we hear that, that we have to walk, we came to conclusion that most situation must be bad for Germans if they don™t have train or trucks to Œ Q: To take us. A: Œ get us there. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 152Q: Okay. A: So, we walk. We get Œ again, more than normal portion of breakfast this mor Œ bread, and margarine and we start to walk. We walk. There was the Œ we were at the end of Harz mountains and so we walk east, ove r the mountains, so the place get higher and higher. And that was the road, the highest road in the slope of north Œ north slope of the mountains. And so afte r a couple days, we didn™t have anything to eat, so we™re gonna Œ well, at the beginning, we just get not too far from this place Œ nice town, Seesen, I remember, very nice town. I was there later, after the war, for a while. And they took about 18 or so prisoners, and took Œ they were Œ we were in forest, walking through forest Œ took them on sight, and shoot them there. And why? Because they were thieves. Thieves? What kind of thieves? When we were digging Œ working near the field w ith potatoes, and there was large la Œ landlord with a large play Œ a large field of potatoes, and they piling up those potatoes, you know, before they covered them. So it was mu Œ large Œ Q: Pile. A: Œ pile of potatoes. So somebody sneak in and steal a couple. I did that too couple times. And if it Œ th-the Œ he was caught. So he was Ponish(ph), and he get on the list as a thief. And those thieves, they shoot them. Q: On this march. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 153A: On this march. And then we start to walk. We walked, it was death march. And well, the food was going. Th ey didn™t give us much more, so we were getting weaker. Some people cannot walk, older people especially cannot walk, because they were too weak. And they took them one side, shoot them, and we went further. That was called death march, and ther e were many of those death march in Germany at Œ near the end of the war. And so what saved us Œ me, was dog biscuits. I have great respect for dog biscuits [indecipherable] Q: Really? So how did yo u get these dog biscuits? A: Well, one night we Œ we were already in mountains. You know, fields, forests, not much any places, were here and there some motels, hotels, you know, on the road. Some hotels, specially for tourists you know, and the people who want spend vacation in mountains, you know, so some sanitoriums. And one evening we were getting close to night, and we hear dog Œ dog barks, you know. And are many over there. So we get to farm where they raised these German Shepherds, those German dogs. So they put us Œ dark was just about approaching, so they put us against barn. Was here, and then here was this building with dogs, they™re barking. And so they got only here to cover, to have the guard, you know. And the evening, or at night, when the Œ those guys against the wall in this barn, you know, one of them noticed that one of plank, the wall was wooden pl anks, you know, up and down.

A: So this means that British and American forces are closing. So they put us one night in large pile of straw and so on, on the field. And in the morning, close to morning, we Œ first time we hear this machine guns, even artillery, and then machine. So first thing was we try Œ in the morning we stay again, we don™t go out. Well, early in the morning, just -- just little, not completely daytime, trucks arrive and get out Œ they get us out. And we decided that we will stay here. There was about 50 of us Poles, and we got one fellow, he was oldest one among us, and by profession he was engineer from Poland . And so we Œ so the people get out, and we stands there. Then trucks arrive, and th en in last moment, this guy says, you know Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 156what? Ma Œ this is not Œ no time, let™s go. We just jump out. Shortly after they start to machine guns in the straw, and those who stay there all were killed. Q: Oh my God. A: Some of them tried to escape, you kn ow, get out, but they were knocked down by the machine gun. So we were lucky. Q: Okay. A: But next day Œ the same day, the truc ks Œ we went through a town which was no Œ no any authority in uniform. They had civilians Œ civilians militia. Q: Okay. A: Civilians with old guns, you know [indecipherable] keep order, you know, the town. So we know that there™s no Œ an y police, not even no Gestapo, no army, nobody else. So Œ and they ge t us through this town, and drop us in the field. Near was forest, and so now we start to get to Œ get Œ what the hell to do? And we came to conclusion, they™re now th e guard. There was one Œ one SS officer, I don™t remember his title now, who was from Poland, German from Poland; speak Polish as good as I did. And when they start to kill those guys who cannot walk all Œ all the way, the le Œ and they were weak, cannot walk, they just take them outside and shoot them, and we go further. Was Œ was 50 of us, we put ourself arms, and we decide Œ we got some few older people with Œ among us, that we are not going to Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 157allow that. In case they try to pick up anyone from us, the closest one un Œ und Œ di Œ di Œ guard Œ we jump on the closest guard, and get his gun, we can Œ they will kill Œ older guns Œ older guys will kill few of us, but we will get gun, and then we can be [indecipherable] the rest. Q: Okay. A: So Œ and this guy, he was in charge of this march from SS, this guy from Poland Œ German from Poland . And he saw that we are walking like that, and he came to us in Polish. He told us, don™t be afraid. The Œ you™re is Œ you Œ it is okay, you are okay. Don™t be afraid, nothing will happen to you guys. Q: Mm-hm. And so when did you run away? A: So, in this field, as I said, they jump Œ dump us from the trucks, and we came to conclusion that this is the time to Œ is forest nearby, they won™t Œ now, the guard change a exce Œ with exception of two or three younger SS, those Hitler followers, the rest were old men from the first World War, 50 or 60 years old. They mobilized them, and they replaced the younger SS, who went to fight. They Œ they put them as a guard in that Œ and so we know that they won™t shoot us, they will shoot guard in the window is where we were sending, you know. Q: Okay. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 158A: And this is right Œ it Œ it Œ it Œ it would happen. Really, that Œ those guys were Œ hate those [indecipherable] not as Œ worse than we did.

They then Œ in some Œ we hear already some machines Œ mo-motors coming, and they line up, then they throw the guns a-ahead of them, and then we hear the motor cross. So one with the keys walked to the gate, you know. But be fore he Œ he Œ he tried to Œ were just about trying to put the key in the Œ Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 162Q: Gate? A: Œ in the door when the gar Œ shot, you know, from the other side, Americans shoot the door Œ you know, this lock, and kick Œ knock the Œ with foot, you know, open the door.

So the tanks are on their way, and next Œ many tanks afte r the first one. So we Œ then we get out and I went to Œ in the town, and I ran into Polish camp, several hundreds Poles, after uprising in Warsaw. Q: Ah, yes. A: They were sent there, and they were working in Œ in various places in this little town. And it turned out that the town had many food ware houses. So they were wor Œ pardon me Œ they were working in Œ in various warehouses, and Œ and Œ and some food factories in the town. Q: You said food warehouses? A: Food warehouses, yeah. Q: Yeah, mm-hm, okay. So those were pretty good jobs to have. A: Yeah, well sure, they have Œ after the Warsaw uprising. Q: Did you know Œ A: So I joined them and with them, so Œ Q: Did you know about the uprising? Cause you were already arrested. A: I was in Buchenwald . We know Œ we learn about because one day we noticed that the SS toward us became quite rough, you know. So what? But, as I said, we Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 164had, in Buchenwald was strong communist underg round organization. So, from them we learn that Warsaw uprising, it is Œ Q: Going on. A: Œ uprising in Warsaw , and this is the reason the Germans are so tough to us. Q: Okay. So you joined this group of pe ople who had been sent to labor camps Œ A: Yeah. Q: Œ who had been part of this Warsaw uprising. And where did you go? A: Yeah. Well, we stayed there. I told myself I got the Œ enough German concentration camp, I don™t want try Sovi et concentration camps, because I know that they are not better, and on top of that, they are in much colder places. Because Siberia is much colder than Germany . So I decided to Œ not to go back. And although I™ve got family there, my first love was there. But here I was afraid because I was in underground press, and I was on black list among the Œ with the communists, you know. Is anti-communist and anti-Soviet. And so, I don™t know, we Œ I didn™t stay with them too long, then I joined some Œ they were for Œ organized displaced person camps. And they were to transfer, you know, some camp. Oh, we Œ I stay for a while, and then this place was taken by Soviets. They Œ it was freed by Americans, but this part s upposed to be British zone. But in last Œ just before the war ended, they decided in the campgrounds just before the war Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 165ended, that this part will be Soviet zone. It will be handed to Soviet zone because Soviet get too small part of Germany. Q: Okay. A: So it was Œ the further was Œ so the British told us about, and they even organized transport for us to get out ev en, you didn™t want. Some who want to go back to Poland , they stayed there and wait until Soviets arrive, and I don™t know what happened to that, but we get out to west, on the British zone, so we stay as Œ stayed, then I Œ well, I Œ we get to this Œ I mentioned this little town, Seesen, a very nice town and it turned out there were many thousands of Poles from Poland during the war that can do work in German factories in those warehouses and so on. And so we get there, and not long, and because they put u Œ put us in hotel by the railroad, and they will sh Œ they were o-opening the Œ a railroad, and they went to open the hotel, too. So they transfer us someplace else. So I Œ I was not too far Œ well, in this town, there were Œ there was thousands of Poles, and we had no information. So I get contact not too far away, was first Polish Panzer division from Great Britain, who occupy northwestern part of Germany. So I got contact with them, and I came to conclusion that we need something to [indecipherable] so I will publish Œ edit again, bill Œ bulletin, and we™ll Œ I will get through that, from Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 166them, some information. And so I started that, and in one of the bulletin, I brought Œ there was t Œ Pottsdam conference, between Stalin Œ Q: The f Œ yeah, the four powers. A: Yeah, three powers. Q: Three powers, yeah. A: Stalin, Churchill and Roosevelt. And Churchill was replaced by Attlee because during the time was election Œ Q: Elections, yeah. A: Œ and Churchill lost the par Œ par [indecipherable] conservative party, lost the power, and Attlee replace him, socialist. And I wrote that Œ but that is this time still Churchill was there. I Œ I was surprised that Truman Œ then Churchill and Truman talked to some ba ndit like hit Œ like Stalin, who is not better than Hitler. Q: Yeah. A: So, I wrote true. But couple weeks late r, I was preparing next edition, and my room knocked the door. I look, British MP. Q: Oh my.

And so they put me in Œ in Œ well, first to the head of the jail, the German Œ the German Œ jail was German some Œ the guards and everything, all the administration wa s German. So when they sent Œ they brought me Œ guard brought me on second floor, and put me in some Œ opened some door, and there were three or four prisoners, and they were criminals, you know, for crimes, various crimes. And so I knocked the door back and said this guard to return. What? I am political prisoners, I can be not Œ Q: With them, right. A: Œ I Œ I should be separately, not with the criminals. So, let™s go to the head of the jail. So you know, the guy said Œ German sa id, well, I don™t have room. This is your problem, not mine. After spending, you kn ow, years in tortures of Gestapo and a year in a concentration camp, that was, for me, like sa nitorium, you know, not jail. Q: Yeah. A: And that Œ besides that, I noticed that the Germans didn™t kn ow what to do with me. Political prisoners of his majesty, King of England . Because this was Œ I was political prisoner. Q: Okay.

A: They walk me back to jail. Q: And they couldn™t find Œ A: And I know that they have interpreter Œ Q: Of course. A: Œ because in the camp which I was living, and pu-publishing this little bulletin, was family named Grabowska(ph) from Poznan , but they were kicked out in 1939 to Warsaw , so they Œ after the Warsaw uprising, they were in Germany . And the daughter study English before th e war at the University of Poznan. And she was working in the office of British general, commander of the occupied part of this territory. So she was working this Œ in Polish-English interpreter. So I know her because this family, this Œ her mother practically save my life, because when we get Œ we get [indecipherable] in this, you know, people ge t very hungry. So I just happened, by accident that I get to them. And she told me, no, no, I will s Œ feed you. So she wouldn™t let me eat, you know , any f Œ meat or any fat stuff, chicken soup or something, but she prepar e something, or Œ or, you know Œ Q: Right.

Q: Yeah, they died. Their systems couldn™t take it. A: The system cannot take it, because syst em was not prepared for, for a long time. Q: So Œ so Œ so you™re back in this prison, you know they have a Polish interpreter, then what ha Œ A: Yes. Q: Œ then what happens? A: So I didn™t told him. He™s the [indecipherable] he™s the power, I am not. Q: Okay. A: So they want me back to Œ you know. After the Gestapo, after the tortures, and the concentration camp, and this situation was like sanitorium, you know. Q: Yeah. A: So, they took me back and few hours Œ couple hours later, they come to pick me up. And they walk me to same room, same vi lla, and here in place of the Russian, is Bouzhayna (ph) Grabowska (ph), this Polish interpreter. Q: Yeah. Then what were their questions? A: Well, the question was that I am Nazi. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 175Q: That you™re Nazi? A: Yes. Q: And why would you be a Nazi? A: Because I wrote that Stalin is not better than Hitler, and Stalin, Uncle Joe is the best friend, you know. Q: Okay. Okay, and so they ask you Œ what do they ask you? A: Well, they ask me an Œ so then this tattoo number of my arms, that I was in concentration camp. You know, this British, he didn™t know it the beginning, but the Bouzhayna (ph) Grabowska (ph) explained to him that this is tattoo number from Auschwitz, concentration camp Auschwitz. Well, he know, already hear something about concentration camp Auschwitz, so he was confused, you know. And he start, you know, beginning; name, bo rn, and this Œ parents and all this. Form Œ formal things, and then what was Œ what I was doing during the war, and so on. So I wi Œ was telling him. And then we st art talking about this problem of Nazi and Œ and so Uncle Joe. So I tell him point blank, maybe these Œ it Œ he is your friends, but he is not our friends. I was in Polish military 1939. We fought Germans, and we were Œ we were hit in the back by Stalin, by Soviets. So for me, Stalin is not better than Hitler. And nobody will convince me that this is not so. Q: And so, what did he do? Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 176A: So, the things change into discussion about politics, foreign relations in Œ in Europe , you know. And because I was good in history, and always interested in politics, so I know quite a bit about it. Probably more than him. And Œ Q: Probably. A: And so he start discussion, and that. So then finally, I was smoking, you know, so I ask him if I can sm-smoke. He says okay. So I si Œ I had Canadian Pall Mall, very good cigarettes, and he got some British, very lousy cigarettes, I know that Œ them, too. So Œ so he smoke d Œ he pulled his, and I s Œ so we smoke our cigarettes. And then we start talking. After a while I again ask him where I can si Œ fr Œ smoke, okay. So I pull, and I si Œ Q: Offer him. A: Œ give him Œ offer him cigarettes. He took it, and he says, you got good cigarettes. And so we smoked cigarettes. So the Œ then into Œ you know, friendly conversation. Then Œ and then he said Œ te ll me there™s no Œ I can™t Œ I know there™s no mi-mis Œ misconce Œ mis Œ not misconcep tion, misleading, something like that. Q: Misunderstanding? A: Misunderstanding. But I cannot do it, I can only [indecipherable] I just make a report, and they will decide, the highers-up will decide. And then, from this Bouzhayna (ph) Grabowska (ph) who was interpreter with the general office, day Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 177or two days later, I learn from her that this, what I wrote about, Stalin , Hitler, you know, not better, it went to Polish repr esentative in town Œ town about 40 kilometers north, where was Polish mission. The mission of the Polish communists, you know. Q: Oh, of the Polish communists. A: The Polish communist government, you know Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ mission. About 40 kilometers, and they get this, my bulletin, with this terrible Œ Q: Comparison. A: Œ comparison, you know. So naturally they send this Œ rush to their superiors in Warsaw, and they to Moscow.

He was married, so he got already some room in the village there, Germans. So he stay, he didn™t want to go back, because they don™t Œ the place was Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 182full, this little hotel was full, and so he stayed over there. But I went there, back. They told me to come back. So I went back, and no, th at is it. But shortly after, w-we were consider a small camp.

A: And so she was helpful, very Œ like the first page, you know, especially some drawing on first page. And so 12 - 13 people. We were consider a small camp. And UNRRA, this international organization which supply food for the displaced person camps, we Œ supply us with food, with Œ with clothing, and whatever they have. And they notify us because we are Nazi, we are taking Œ they don™t supply us any more. So we went as Germans, thousand cal ories a day, but we have to buy that food, and we have no mone y, bu Œ from where? Buy the food from Germans. So it was quite Œ Q: So there was the Americans now Œ instead of the British, it was the American MP? A: Americans, because Uncle Joe Stalin, they were Uncle Joe Œ Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 183Q: Okay. A: Œ you know, Uncle Joe. And so it was bad situation. So we get some money, and we get th-the Œ in we Œ they Œ two, thr ee times a Œ a week, we got herring, because they went to buy from the barrels, you know. They were cheap, and so with potatoes, we have dinner [indecipherable] because we cannot afford to [indecipherable] Q: And you like herring. A: I like, so it was no-not bad for me. I Œ I got nothing against, but these others didn™t like it. Q: I want to Œ I want to summarize this a little bit. What you™re saying is that you worked on a weekly Polish newspaper. A: Yeah. Q: And that Polish newspaper was also again critical of the Soviet Union Œ A: Yes. Q: Œ and eventually the American MPs come and close it down, accusing you of being Nazis, so you can™t publish the paper any more. A: No. Q: And the reason that you™re giving is that the influence of the Soviets Œ that is, as you put it, Uncle Joe, reached into the American zone. And Œ Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 184A: Look Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ the Americans at that time, American opinion, American press, Mr. Roosevelt were all full of praise to [indecipherable]. American soldiers, I hear from American soldiers, Uncle Joe. Q: Okay. A: They do Œ they didn™t tell Œ they didn™t talk about Stalin otherwise but Uncle Joe. Well, you have to admit that Soviet army break Œ broke Œ broke the power of Hitler. That is not question about that. Q: Okay. A: But they did not do that because they were against Hitler, or because they love Americans. But Hitler attacked them, and they have Œ Stalin had no choice, surrendered, or fo Œ fight. So he decided to fight. And now American and British jump to help him, and a Œ not just help him, but embrace him. And the communist propaganda took over press and everything in England and in brit Œ Great Britain, and in everywhere else. And therefore, Stalin was Uncle Joe. Q: All right. So, when the Americans closed you down, the American military authorities Œ A: Yeah. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 185Q: Œ do you believe they were doing it because you were Œ you were being not only critical, but you were attacking an ally of theirs? A: Well, this is what they told us, that we are Nazis, because we are working to break the alliance, you know, spread between the Œ the get Œ Q: Dissension between the a Œ A: Dissension between allies. This was the Œ th-th-the reason. Q: And they didn™t understand, or they di dn™t see a difference that you were coming from Poland , and had your own experience. A: No, they don™t understand that, and as I said, I was in Polish army when we fought Germans, and we were attacked for Soviets. So I had on my back proof, and what I believe it is right. But they didn™t know that. Well, as I said, you have to admit that the Soviet army really broke the power of Hitler army. Q: Yeah, yeah. A: You know. Q: Okay. A: The ar Œ th Œ Normandy would be probably two year s later, and with il Œ will cost thousands more of lives, American, British lives, if not the Soviet™s army. That is true. But as I said, th-they don™t fight, because for Œ because they were against, or something, but they had no choice Œ Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 186Q: Okay. A: Œ because Hitler attacked them and Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ and they Œ and they Œ Q: But what I™m getting at, or what I want to try and clarify is, the first time that your little newspaper, that you published yourself Œ A: Yeah. Q: Œ then you are arrested in the British zone. A: Yeah. Q: The reason why you were arrested is that it went to the Polish communists, it went to Warsaw , it went to Œ A: No, well they Œ you know, because the communists took that Œ Q: Yes, yes. A: Œ you know, th Œ they were not too far away. Q: Yeah, let me finish the question. A: Yeah. Q: Okay. That it went Œ that Œ and in Œ one could make the argument that it was Soviet influence that made your arrest happen, because it went from the Polish Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 187communists, to Warsaw, to Moscow , to London, to Germany, and you would be arrested by the Brits, yes? A: Well, the British didn™t know, they don™t read Polish, so they would not know what I am writing there. Q: Okay. A: So, it went, you know, this way, and to embassy Œ Soviet embassy in London, to the British government, and British government to the commander of Rhine army, and so on. That was the Œ Q: Okay, but one can make the argument that it was Soviet influence, Soviet pressure. A: Yes, yes, yeah. Q: The second time, when the Americans come and close down this newspaper, would it be Soviet pressure, or would it be that the Americans don™t want to offend the Soviets and do it on their own? A: Well, that was Œ it was not direct Œ it was not, you know, through the diplomatic channels, you know. Q: Okay. A: It was probably some higher-ups in Amer ican government in Œ occupying forces Œ Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 188Q: Okay. A: Œ and this UNRRA, who take the Œ Q: Rations away. A: Œ rations for us. We learn later this director of UNRRA, in this American zone, was American communist. Q: Ah, okay. A: You know. Q: Okay. A: So, you know, the politics, it Œ it has various quite interesting angles. Q: Yes, yes. And so your paper is closed, and you have no rations. A: No rations, yeah. Q: So what happens? A: So what happened? As I said, we go t herrings. I didn™t mind my Œ I didn™t mind Œ I like herrings. But not Œ a couple weeks later Œ well, Polish Œ there was a large Polish army in the west, in Italy, from those who Œ Poles who were in Soviet Union , taken to Soviet Union , and when war break out, Stalin release them Œ Q: Right. A: Œ and they form this second Polish [indecipherable] what fought at Monte Cassino, and so on, and there was Œ before that there was Polish [indecipherable] , Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 189a division which participated in Normandy , and occupy northwestern Germany. It was Polish air forces which have great part in this battle of Britain Œ air battle, and the participation of Polish units, and on British airplanes Œ Q: Right. A: Œ naturally. But with Polish [indecipherable] and also Polish pilots on British airplane. They got Œ they got more planes than pilots. Q: Got it. A: And so they participated and they really Œ the British now, they also admit that, that the Œ they aro Œ they won the battle of Britain with Œ the air battle with Britain wi Œ on Œ for Britain, and the Poles participated greatly in that. And so Œ so this was Œ Q: So di Œ so, in other words, what di Œ what significance did that have on the fact that your paper was closed? Did du Œ did it influence it? A: Well, you mean th Œ Q: Yeah, I Œ okay, here Œ let me go back . I asked you, after the paper was closed, what happened. And then you mentioned Œ A: What happened Œ Q: Okay. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 190A: Œ well, so they took away Œ arrest you, and so on Œ and but couple weeks later, one day there was Polish major from the Polish army in Great Britain, I think he was in intelligence unit, he joined us. And some Œ quite often in civilian clothing, he was going somewhere, and so on. We didn™t ask him, but he was Œ it was good to have military person, officer major with Œ so, e-even Germans, you know, we got different situation there.

Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 196A: Yeah. Currency, we can™t afford it, you know. Q: So what did you do? What happened in your life? A: Well, in the Œ shortly after I came to the United States , I get contact with my mother, her sister in chica Œ in Posen , south of Chicago. And so we start to corresponded. And matter of fact, one of the cousin came to me in Eppstein in this Œ when I was in this paper there. One day, some Amer ican soldiers on Jeep came, and soldiers get out and ask fo r me in Polish. So I get out. Roman. He was son of my aunt from Posen, serving in the American military. And so he get from her mother my address, and so he came to visit me. Q: Isn™t that a ma Œ your first cousin. A: My first cousin, yeah. Q: Yeah. When you came to the United States , how did you support yourself? A: Well, I came to my aunt, and Œ but I don™t want to be supported by anybody, so I tried to do some Œ anything to work. Well, first week or two in the family, there was my uncle here, and so on, so it was a lot of parties going on, drinking and so on. But then Œ so I start first my job, I had Œ I was unloading tomatoes. There was factory producing ketchup. And when the season started Œ so I work at night 12 hours, for night. Hour for lunch at no Œ at midnight , unloading trucks, bo xcars from railroad, and so unloading them to the factory, as go. That was for the first time. Then I work Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 197in the Œ in the outfit which repaired boxcars that Œ railroad t Œ railroad cars. But then I got Œ just about lost my eye because the spark from Œ Q: From one of the wheels, or something? A: Not wheels, the Œ no, how you call it? The guy li Œ I was walking between two boxcar, and he opened the torch, you know. Q: Ah, okay. A: Torch, and the spark j-jump. And so th ey took me to a doctor, and I get home with bandage my Œ my eye. My aunt sa id, no more. I don™t want you to lose your eye here. We got sa Œ to eat sa Œ we got enough to eat. Well, I cannot sit home, it is not wi-with my nature. And so, through my uncle, I get job at Canfield™s (ph) beverage company in Chicago. It was Œ you have to drive Œ not drive really, didn™t have car, but take buses, you know, two buses to get there. And so I was working on the yard, they call it. It Œ from noon. So there was various Œ one of Œ every day [indecipherable] of time take, it was to sort enough bottles. Drivers brought and Œ gave this wooden bo-boxes, you know, with bottles, and th-they are mixed up, white and green, because in tavern, or in s Œ in store, if they give to the Œ he don™t look the white or Œ or green bottles, he put in the case Œ Q: Whatever. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 198A: Œ whatever, so there were white and green. And we sort them out, because green were ginger ale. All other Œ lemonade Œ all other drinks were in white Œ Q: Bottles. A: Œ white bottles. And only ginger ale was green, so we sort enough so they can go to production and Œ and know where. And th en later we work to load the trucks with full cases of Œ of those drinks, help driv ers to Œ help to Œ help Œ help drivers to load this Œ his trucks, so he put where he want, according to his schedule, you know, first go first and so on. He knows what he got next stop, next day, what he have to deliver, and to who. And so that was again interesting American story. One day Mr. Canfield junior, who run the factory, his father established that Œ he came every day for a few Œ for a few hours to office, and get chauffeur and so on, but A-Art Canfield was running the business. And one day he walk, and talk to the workers. And he came to me, I know few words in English, so what nationality? Polish. Oh hey Œ hey Joe, that was next truck, I know the guy, Joe Horanian(ph), I still remember his name, truck driver, and he was Polish. Bo-Born here, but speak Polish and English. So he came as interpreter, so Canfield said Œ a-ask me what I was doing in Germany. I said, a concentration camp. What you Œ when you came here? Forty-nine Œ that was Œ that was 1950 , or sa Œ 1950 probably A-April, March, Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 199April, something like that. So I was Œ what I was doing from ™45 to ™49. So I said, I was in Œ in newspaper, Polish ne wspaper. Yeah, I was, really Œ Q: Mm-hm, yeah. A: Œ in this Œ in this ﬁKronika .ﬂ So, said, what are you doing here? I says, well, it has the way of make living. One work, and next one they had ways to steal. I don™t want steal, so I got no other choice but to work. So he says, John, you okay. Okay. Next day, the girl came from the office, they called me to the of Œ main office. So I went there, there was the telephone operator. She was of Polish origin, so speak Œ she speak English and Polish. And so he aske d me if I drive. I di Œ I didn™t. Do you know anything about motors, cars, [indecipherable] trucks? No. You want to learn? I said, I learn many thing, so ma ybe I can learn that too. Okay, tomorrow start in the garage as a mechanic helper. This was my career, and I became mechanic helper, and then I became mechanic. I have to join the union. But when I learn English [indecipherable] I decided to follow my journalist dreams. So I register at Loyola University for political science as background for journalist. And I went to Mr. Canfield(ph) because I have to, twice a week, quit sooner. Four o™clock I have to quit, change, and go to Œ for six o™clock Œ six o™clock Œ Q: Classes. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 200A: Œ classes at the Loyola Univers Œ they had main ca Œ in this downtown campus, across the old water tower in Chicago here. So Œ and Mr. Canfield says, well, it would be hard for us sometimes, because you know, [indecipherable] broke something, so we go to repair on the streets, sometimes far away, even. But, that is important to you, so he let me go. He let me do that. And so, after sometimes, four years or so, I finally get job in Polish Œ one of the Polish newspaper, as assistant editor, for very little in comparison with what I was making as Œ as journalist. But I wa Œ Q: You mean as a mechanic. A: As a mechanic. Q: Yeah, okay. A: Yeah, and so Œ but short Œ after some times, I get my Bachelor™s degree from Loyola, and I quit this paper because I don™t like politics of this paper. And I get job, very interesting, in Cook county by true friend of mine, was involved in pal Œ Republican party, and he gave me job in his [indecipherable] he was [indecipherable] at this time Republican elected, and as a bailiff Cook county jail.

So the job was to bring prisoner to si Œ to the court Œ they Œ it was no problem because there was tun-tun-tunnel from the jail to Œ to the court. And then sit, keep him in the room there, and walk hi m out to the court, and sit behind him to make sure that he didn™t jump Œ Q: Right. A: Œ you know, on Œ on judge, and so on. So it was interesting because we had many cases, you know. Q: Yeah, sure. A: Interesting cases. Then they changed swise Œ switch Œ cha-changed me to social worker, which was even more in-interesting; social worker in jail. Q: Oh my goodness. A: Yeah. Very interesting job. Then they turn me to Œ switch me to women, because I was oldest of the social workers, so they came to conclusion that I will se Œ I™ll be more safe Œ safer than some younger guys . And very interesting job, I learn many interesting situation in the life people have, problems and so on. Q: And when did you come to work again as a journalist? You told me earlier you worked for 17 years Œ A: Yes. Q: Œ for a major Polish daily. Tell me about that Œ Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 202A: As the chief editor. Q: As chief editor.

A: Œ Dutch, or whatever nationality the ne Œ country they were, an attic, or somewhere, and they don™t know much wh at was going on.

And in addition, they Œ Poland was consider part of German lebensraum, the territory the Germany needs to create thousand years empire. Q: Yeah. A: According to Hitler.

So quite often we have to go to some schools, you know, large group, and talk to them in school. So that has some good part, because we c Œ it depends on the school how much time I get. Here I got half hours, you know. And over there, sometimes I get hour, sometimes even more. But here they go through museum, so they learn about the many things, you know, ghettos and things lik e that. Well, over there they don™t do that, so I have to mention about that. I don™t Œ I didn™t know exactly what happened in ghetto, because I was not there. I know quite a bit, but this is not the same thing. Interview with John Krawiec January 29, 2015 210And so it Œ I met some people, as I said, some teachers, who didn™t believe it, and one time, when we were going out, me Œ sometimes teachers ask students to write their impression. So I had several of t hose letters, I don™t know, maybe close to hundreds of them, and they sent later to me Œ they sent to Holocaust museum, and the mus Œ museum to me.
