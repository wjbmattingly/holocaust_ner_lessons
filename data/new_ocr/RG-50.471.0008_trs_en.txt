Also, they had to wait if a order to wear the Jewish star on both uh--on the front and in the back of your vermin garment and you couldn't walk on the sidewalk. You had to walk uh in the street--not close to the dirt. So that was also humiliating. Just about everybody knew that you were and whoever passed by uh--'Oh, you dirty Jew!' I also have to tell you that the Lithuanian population were very mean. Before the Germans even came, they had people already hundred and hundred and hundreds of Jews by themselves. SB: Did you see any of that or? MG: Uh--sure! Because it was in the center of town or it was once this one day I went out to look up my brother's friend and there I saw that uh bodies on the street. He lived in uh section where there were more religious people--you know, with beards and those special clothes what's a religious people wear.

And both my cousin and the husband from my other cousin they were taken away. And when they were taken away, my ant and the uh and duh her daughter and the two children they came to live with us. And one day, somebody rang in our bell and there was a Lithua- nian soldier standing and he asked for my cousin--you know--for Mrs.--Mrs. Fondbeck and when she came to the door, he said, 'Come with me and you can see your husband.' So she was afraid to go, so I went and hold with her. And he took us to a courtyard and there we really actually saw him. And he at that time said that it's very bad and that he is together with our brother but he doubted that we'll see each other again. And then we went back and that's was we need two--we didn't see them anymore. They were killed on the 7th fort. SB: Okay. MG: And then when we went into the ghetto, we all went together.

So we rented or we uh--uh little wagon and uh we took the other fuel, beds what we had and uh our personal belongings--clothes and--and that's how we went in a few parts and that's how we went into the ghetto. And it was uh site you know--what you--you saw on the wagon--wagon after wagon--the whole street. And the place where we went uh--uh it was called Slabotka and at that time the didn't it wasn't paved. There were cobblestones and that's how we move in to um. SB: Okay we're just about to run out.

MG: Well, it turned upside down. First of all, I tell you, we were also like strangers in that Jewish commu- nity because we didn't know too many people. We came from Maimal. We live only in Kovno like a year and at that time it was also already the Russians were there so nobody felt really very safe and uh not safe but you didn't socialize too much because under the Russians, you were always afraid to uh se--uh talk and can say something so we really felt like strangers. We didn't have too many and there was also no time to socialize in the ghetto. You got up in the morning, you went to work, you came back in the evening and uh the only thing is that and that we realized later that we were all together and we still had our own clothes and if it rained as in next day, you could put on something else. We in the camp you couldn't. So that was uh but otherwise uh we really we didn't uh you know-- SB: And at the beginning, there were Actions. Um did you know about any before the Great Action?

But you know, when you live, and you always want to believe the better part and at that time they said that they take them to swap books. They wanted more or less like people who are intelligent; that uh to read books and to make a library and to do this and to do that. And then when I worked--I mean I going to off now--but when I worked at the commander from the ghetto, his father once came over and he said you know, you're working ask it might be he could know where he is or uh it might be he could even bring him back or so I didn't ask him directly but uh--uh the commander, he had like a bal- let--you know he took care of this uh when there were not in one place. Otherwise I mean I polished his shoes and all that--that's while they were sitting. But uh I asked him and then he came back and he says--you know what he said? First of all, he came back he said well what is he to you? So I said well he's my fianc‡ because I wanted to uh. So then he came back and he said--you know what he said?--that he feels sorry for you. So you knew that they went down already of the 500 men and boys. And um-- SB: Before we go to that job, let's talk about the Great Action. Do you remember that?

So we all went and you know at that time, as I said, we still had our clothes and because my dad was in textile we were quite well dressed and we were--I have to say it myself--we were quite--quite a very handsome family. My dad and my mother and my brother--we were all good looking and uh tall. So we were standing--my father and my brother on the sides and we two, my mother and I, in the middle. And in the back was my ant and my cousin and her two small children. And when we went through and that I really never forget--when we went through, you know, whe we came closer to the German, he was standing like this, you know and he said 'Right, left, right, left' uh so he asked us, is that one family and my dad said yes and he said 'Please, straight ahead.' So we probably made because for a German to say to a Jew, 'Please.' So we probably made the impression on him too. And then--and then we so went to the right, you know, all of a sudden my dad turned around and he said you know this the taunt his eyes and he uh ant Sara. So--and all of a sudden I see and there was a group to the left and they were sur- rounded by Lithuanian police and they were there, so in a corner, I saw one for whom I had worked after the commander, I worked for somebody else in that same outfit. So I ran over and when he saw me running over, he said, 'Miriam what happened to your family?' I said, 'We are here but my ant is not with us.' He said, 'Come with me.'

There was the small ghetto and the big ghetto. So they were all taken. There were about 10,000 people. They were taken to the small ghetto and during the night they were taken to one of the forts and liquidat- ed. SB: Did you see any? Did you see them going up the road to the fort? MG: No, those we I--I didn't because mostly when trans- ports came and they brought the Germans quite a lot transport form Germany and from um em Austria but mostly it was done during the night. Only once during the--they brought them and probably they were delayed. So they took them over during the--you know--in the morning and our ghetto was surrounded with uh barbed wire and had our own police. So when the police saw so many people going, so they opened a little--you know--the barbed wire and they said--I mean they could say it to everybody but you know, a few, 'Come here. Come in here.

SB: Did you--could you here machine guns from where you were? Did you? MG: No, but I'll tell you how we knew that they are bringing people or that they have in Action. In the ghetto, they use to come for lime. You know that white stuff what I don't know it doesn't make you smell bodies or uh they say it was uh you know in there ghetto there was probably there was a pit from that. So when we saw those wagons going with the lime, we knew something will happen. All in the ghetto or they bring uh us--uh you know somebody from another country to be killed. SB: And now tell me how you came to work for that officer? MG: What--when the ghetto was closed, a couple of days later, they came and they looked for silver and gold. And so they went from house to house. And it so hap- pened that the commander probably must have come, you know, like faith, to our house and when he heard us talking German between my parents and us children.

So he so I said to h--'Yeah, okay.' So he said, 'Okay, come along.' So he took me right away with his car and he took me out of the ghetto, into his apartment and he introduced me to his Milay and he said from now on , I mean--he'll be your--you'll be respon- sible to him, you know and he'll tell you what to do. And he wrote uh note that I can go by myself to the ghetto from his house an in the morning, from the ghetto to his house. So I actually was the first one who had such a uh note that I am allowed to work by myself because mostly when people went to work, they all went in a big group like a brigade, you know, Brigaded--use to call--it was called. And I was only one to uh have that uh and the first one. I mean later, some other people also got uh jobs individually. But I was the first one of the Kovno ghetto, to have that uh piece of paper. In fact, when I came back, you know those things, now you remember when I ca--yeah and then that day we--no I went back by myself, and my parents they probably thought that they would never see me again. So when I walked in to ghetto by myself and as I said people didn't know me because we--we were uh not familiar with uh people. So I heard from time to time, when I was walking uh, people saying, 'Oh you know, a German, he took a young girl. Who knows what will happen to her.'

SB: Tell me about the Jewish Police--the ghetto police. MG: The ghetto police they had it very tough because on one side they--I mean they were commanded to work with the Germans. On the other side, they wanted to help the Jews. So in general, they were all very nice. There were a few you know, what you'd find all over who wanted to be holier than the Pope but in general they were nice and they warned the people and uh it was I mean we all really say looked out for each other because we were all in the same boat.

But you know, the Jewish religion does not allow. So she didn't touch not even a morsel of that. But for us children and my father she felt that we go to because she did not go to work, she stayed home. So she felt that we needed it more and she cooked for us and we ate it.

And a lot of times the German did the Jew but, you know, they always had the helpers. And they went from house to house and when they found children, they took them. There was one man--he didn't want to give his daughter, so they took him too. And there was another lady. She was even a gentile and she married a Jew and she opted to into the ghetto with her husband and their two children. And when they came and at that time she even said she said, 'You know, my brothers are on the front fighting for you and you want to take me and my children?' But that didn't mean anything.

That before the war will fin- ished we'll be...so the mood after each selection and after each eh months and after each thing that was probably when we heard that the Germans were defeated there in Russia. For us it was not like a joy. For us it was always well soon our time will come to be de- stroyed and killed. SB: Um, was the ghetto getting smaller?

And then when you opened it, there was mashed the potatoes in and it was a coating of butter or margarine uh so that was a big disappointment because you gave away a lot of things and a lot of good things because when the Rus- sians came, people who had money bought a lot of things because we knew that the Russians that means the money they only nationalize. So they uh--to even though they had good clothes and good sheets and good baby clothes and if you gave away to us, it didn't mean anything because we didn't use those baby clothes and we didn't use those sheets and uh so we uh came home and found there are mashed potatoes in and it was like in a pound to uh you know you were so happy that you would give your children and your family a big treat with the butter but it wasn't meant to be.

But for instance there was one man uh and he was a police- man in the ghetto and he did get his child and he went alone. It was uh Mr. Bohk. And a few others who were there for sure they quite a few were taken, you know, all their uh parents. SB: Do you know what happened to the children?

Um because when as soon as the ghetto got a way smaller and smaller, they closed off parts. So when my mother was taken away and my husband's family, we all went together with my dad and my brother and my cousin and my ant and the children--we all lived together. So and the children were really good because they were told that they shouldn't--that they should hardly breath you know, not a sound out of them. But the air was so stuffy and I really--I could breath. So I said you know, whatever will happen to me, I going out. So my husband and my dad came along and I was pleading with my brother to come also. And he said no he said, 'Whatever will happen, I'm staying here and don't I'm not moving.' And unfortunately I'm he got because when we taken away from the ghetto, the ghetto was already burning and they all perished. So and I'm sure that if he would have come with us, he probably would have been alive. SB: Describe-- MG: Because my dad survived and my husband survived and he would have probably survived too.

I mean because you know when we when you started to run, and somebody else from the other neigh- borhood came, you couldn't tell him he can't come in. You had to let him in too.

But after the war, when we were liberated by the Russians in January of '45 and the war was still going on, so we figured that we--so then we were from the whole camp, when were about 700 women. About 20 were sent to a hospital and I was among the 20. So after that when we stayed there and I mean the Russians themselves--they didn't have any food and they didn't have any food for us. So we were lingering around and then they said that they sent us back to Lithuania. So and we ourselves wanted to go because that's where we came from and we wanted to go back there.

So on one--in one town we stayed on the railroad and a few people in Polish uniforms came by and they were talking and at that time, uh Poland was still very antisemitic and they were talking a little Polish and they asked us, 'Are you from Metchstek Aumha?' And Metch- steka in Poland means a town and Aumha is the Hebrew word for the Jewish people. So we knew they were Jews so we knodded our heads so they said we should come down and then when we came down, the started to talk to us in Jewish and they said, 'What are you doing,' 'Who are you?' and uh. So we said we are uh refugees, we survived the camps and now we want to go back to Lith- uania. So the guys said, 'Do you know if somebody is alive from your family. And we said, 'No.' He said, 'Please don't go back. It's a very large door in but a very small one out. Stay in Poland and if you hear that somebody of the family is there, they always let you in, the Russians.' So we took their advice and we went to a bigger town to Lebline and stayed there and at that time also, we didn't have anything to eat and still wore our clothes from the camps because we didn't have anything.

And when they heard that you know my name they said, 'Oh, you know, your husband and your father, they are both alive and they are in the American zone.' Because they were all in Dakaw and they were liberated by the Americans. So what--can imagine that we were very happy. And for the other women, they also said that her husband is alive and for the next one, they said her husband was killed but eh the brother in law was alive. So we decided we go to Germany already and that is a story by itself. So also at that time, you couldn't go uh so we use to live in the train station and whenever we saw a um--a train, we went on it and one town we met up with 2 German men. I mean they were Jewish. So we use to sit and talk and we use to converse in German. So all of a sudden we were arrested as spies so but the soldiers were drunk and in the morning a different group parent came and we explained we are Jews, so they let us go. So finally we came, we treaded and treaded and that was, as I said, I was liberated in January, and that was July, we came finally to Berlin.

And they brought a let--a letter from his wife and she wrote there that she has investigated from people what she knew their faith and everything is more or less hundred percent because whatever she felt it was not really true, she didn't put in the list and she writes to my husband--they both wrote--the man and his wife--that we are sorry to tell you that your wife Miriam died and we don't have any words for you and her father but on the other hand, you know how we were close to death and you have to see to pull yourself together and then she wrote in that same letter: but I also have good news for you that your bo--your sisters both survived and I'm sure you'll hear from them. So that was Friday night that my husband got that letter. So they decided they'll make a service and you know we had a prayer what we said after the dead like we say it for 11 months. So in between m--some of my husband's friends had gone to also to Germany to look for people and going going going they ended up to France and there they found a friend of mine who knew with who I was together who knew that I was alive.

One, I was dead and she wrote with such authority that she--like she didn't make a mis- take. So he didn't know what to expect. So finally he thought that he would go eh to Germany, to look for me. Some was on Poland, I mean, because that girl uh in France, who had given the information, she had said that she had left me in Poland. So my husband thought that he would go and look for me.
