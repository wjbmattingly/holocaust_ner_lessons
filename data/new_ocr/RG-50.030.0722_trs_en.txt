UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER: And much more atheist. A: He knows much more better than I do because -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER: He was there every summer. A: He was there every summer. And that was when it was -- everything had changed much more than -- than I was still there. More -- because my mother was not that religious when I was little, and she was -- When you were there, she was very religious. Q: So your son Davi d is saying that your younger brother Geurt -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER: "Geurt." Q: -- "Geurt" became quite religious like your mother in his later years? A: Not like -- not like my mother. Q: Not like your mother? A: No. Interview with Matilda ﬁJuneﬂ Bakker 19 UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER: He was very religious. It gives you an idea of how religious. A: Well, he's -- well, he goes to church every Sunday, and he believes in the Bible and -- but he is not in the least bit trying to do -- trying to recruit anybody else. Q: So he is not imposing this on anybody else? A: No. Q: But your mother did? A: Yes. Q: Okay. And your older brother, from what your son says, was not particularly so. Okay. A: He wasn't religious at all. He was just like my father and me. Q: Okay. A: I will tell you something. Q: Okay. A: During the war, when I was in the resistance, sometimes Nazis would come to the door and find out things.

A: Huh? Q: They would have raids? A: Raids. Interview with Matilda ﬁJuneﬂ Bakker 20 Q: Okay. So they would go and search the houses? UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER: Yeah. A: Yeah. Q: Okay. All right. A: And my mother -- because my mother said, "God says that you shall never lie, and I cannot lie. So then I have to tell them what I know about you." And then --but she went to bed. She -- she acted like she was asleep or sick or whatever. And my father told the Nazis that I was in Germany working for them. Q: So your father had no problem with that kind of twisting of the truth? A: No, he did not have any problem with it. But she disappeared because she said, "God says you may not lie." Q: Okay. So -- A: So that's how idiotic it was. Q: Well, she went to bed when she wasn't slee py, so that could be a sort of kind of lie.

Obviously, we couldn't -- Q: You couldn't do -- you co uldn't have a public wedding? A: No. Q: Okay. A: So anyway, but it never happened. Becaus e one day we were going to -- to a meeting of people that --secret stuff in there, in the resistance.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER: He had a transmitter. A: He had a transmitter. But I didn't know it at that time. Because if they had arrested me and then asked me, you know, you never k now, because they would torture you to get the things out of you. So -- but anyway, one day I said -- you know, we were in a train on the way home, and I said, "I'm not going to go home with you now, because I haven't seen my parents for quite a while, and I have to tell them a few things." And I keep up to date with each other, with my parents. So I got out of the train, and I went to my parents' house and -- well, that was -- never even talked about anything. And the next day, I went to the place where we were supposed to meet, and he didn't show up and he didn't show up. And then later -- and then one of his fri ends came by and say, Oh, you're here. Yeah, that's right. He said, Last night or -- no, early, early this morning, they -- the Nazis knocked on the door, and they arrested him a nd -- anyway, four students who lived there.

A: It was war time. And this morning they were arrested, and they were taken out of the apartment where they lived, and where I lived, too, for -- so -- Q: And you didn't see him again? A: I never saw him again. Interview with Matilda ﬁJuneﬂ Bakker 28 Q: You never saw him again? A: No. Because after the war, the Germans had very exact records of everything they did.

Q: And -- A: And he was -- yeah, he was in contact with England and -- yeah. I guess he did -- he knew a lot that I didn't know that the Germans wanted to know.

A: Did daily -- Q: Daily life, your everyday life. You know, if you went to the cinema or if you went to buy food, or did things change in yo ur environment after that occupation? A: Well, that was -- that went so slowly. The changes were not just, bang, like that. Interview with Matilda ﬁJuneﬂ Bakker 42 Q: Okay. So they happened gradually? A: Gradually, very gradually, very slowly. And I did -- I -- that office that I was talking about that did all of that stuff, that was -- that didn't exis t anymore after a while because there was no -- there was no use for it. Q: Okay.

But sometimes they would check at the main bureau or the department. And then if that name wasn't ther e, then they knew where you were, so you were still arrested or they took the people in the house where you had been living. So on paper, they would bring them back into the central register and then give the forged -- Interview with Matilda ﬁJuneﬂ Bakker 50 Q: IDs?

Q: When did you get involved in not only delivering ID cards, but putting them together? A: I think about 1943, yeah. It must have been something, 1943. Q: What was that process? A: Huh? Q: How did you do this? What did you have to do to make this happen? A: Oh, no. This was just -- because I knew so many people in all these different offices, that they would ask me to do this or do that . And slowly it got more and more involved over the years. I didn't one day st art saying, "I'm going to do this." Q: Of course not. Of course not. What I'm trying to get a sense -- A: Because it was very slowly I got more and more involved.

A: And my father brought -- he said, "We went through your office, through your stuff that you left." And then -- because I was goi ng to work here for one year and go back. And then we met, and we got married, and I stay ed here. So then I left the Netherlands. I was going to move away. I didn't know that at that time. Anyway, we met, and we stayed here. And then my father -- five years later, my father says, "We have cleaned out your room because you're not coming back" -- Q: Yeah. A: -- "living with us." And he had all the papers that I thought -- "I think you may want to save." Q: Good for him. And that's it? A: And that's it. Q: Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness.
