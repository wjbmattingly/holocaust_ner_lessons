A: I was living with my parents and with my sister, which was six years older than me and played extremely important role in my life. It was rather a normal life. I attended private school all my life, and it was expected of me to do my homework and to be a good student. And it was a gi rls™ school. The name of the school was Frieda Mierlos(ph) in Warsaw , and I went there from kindergarten through 12 Œ no, the Œ I graduate gi Œ this was a gymna sium, which I graduate in 1936. I became Œ I got very good education in the school an d after this I apply to law school, which Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 4wasn™t my first choice. Originally I wanted to be a pediatrician, but since being Jewish it was impossible to get to medical school in Warsaw. I even mentioned to my parents that I would like to go to France, but my parents were old fashioned and the idea of a girl going to France didn™t appeal to them. Could be if I would really fight, and wanted very much , I would go, but the upbringing was totally different than it is now of young people. And I was two years in law school, which I didn™t finish because it was in subject that it was ancient law and middle age law which appealed to me. And then for a Œ before the war started, I was helping my father in his factory, where I was typing a little bit, doing some bookkeep ing, but nothing to get excited. And then the war started Œ Q: Okay, let™s talk a little bit more about your home. Did you live in the town, within the town center? A: In Œ in the city of Warsaw I was living, we had a very nice, comfortable apartment. I had the room which I share with my sister, which I adore. She paints my life with roses. She was the best pers on before I met my husband, in my entire life. Q: And what was her name? A: Edith. Edith, Esfia (ph). Q: Did you live in a Jewish neighborhood, or Œ Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 5A: It was a Jewish Œ not a goo Œ not a nice neighborhood. I would say too, except the janitor, hundred percent people were Jewish. Had three courts. The name of the street was Simonhof(ph) 13. It wasn™t a nice neighborhood. Q: Why? In what sense? A: Why? The streets were narrow, the peop le Œ the stores were ugly. Everything was Œ if anybody knows Warsaw , they know that it wasn™t a nice neighborhood. I was walking to school, we had always a housekeeper and we ™re going for vacation, I went to camp. And I went even before the war to Latvia to see my father™s family, my grandmother, which I hardly knew, my aunts and uncles and cousins. And I had many, many friends and it was a nice, quiet life, I would say. I didn™t know any better. Q: Were your friends Jewish children? A: Majority of them were Jewish. As I say, except the janitor and the housekeeper, everybody was Jewish. Q: And at school were your other classmates all Jewish also? A: This was a Jewish private school. However, my first encounter was in law school, where, you know, it was a slogan, down with Jews. But the Jewish girls were the Œ we should be with the Jewish wome n but not with the Jewish men. And I Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 6witnessed when they were cutting with the blades, the coats from the Jewish students, it was winter. Do you know what I am talking about? Q: Well, you want to tell us a little bit more about that? Who was doing it? A: It was tremendous hatred toward Jewish students. I went to University of Joseph Pilsudski, which was Œ at this time he was dead, because he died when I graduate my gymnasium. And the hatred, there were many things which couldn™t Œ Jews couldn™t get. The majority of Jews wh o wanted to be physicians went to Italy, to France, to Czechoslovakia . And they tried everything, a lthough some of them were very poor and it was very hard to sup port themselves overseas, but they were working as waiters and some help from the parents. However, since I was accepted to law school, and in the beginning I th ought maybe I™ll be a law-lawyer, and Œ however when the instructor professor wa s coming to the class and you know, the Jews were sit Œ standing behind the benches and he said still, the Jewish student will not sit on the left hand side, I will not star t the lecture. And he was leaving, and this was right away totally chaos in the class because the Christian were beating up immediately the Jewish male students. Th e women they didn™t touch. And many times when I was walking on the street in Warsaw, in so called mixed neighborhood [indecipherable] Christian, I saw men who were attacked by young Christian boys. Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 7Q: Did you yourself experience, an Œ I mean, I know you ob served anti-Semitic incidents, did you yourself Œ A: I tell you, til the war Œ Q: Œ experience any? A: Œ I didn™t have any contact exactly, I didn™ t have any Christian friends. I Œ so i-I Œ I was very limited because I was living in a ghetto, you know, yeah. I was going to shows, and we went to opera. I remember ﬁMadame Butterflyﬂ was a Japanese song Œ singstress Œ sa Œ woman who was si nging. And however my direct contact, so different from my husband, who went to a state school, was totally different. Some of our teachers in my gymnasium were Christian, however, it was a different relation. Q: How religious was your family? A: My mother was a believer, my father wa sn™t. He Œ Friday within Œ my mother was lighting candles, but my father wa s never there because he was working Saturday. The business was open on Saturday and Sunday he was off. And my mother was kosher Œ the home was kosher, however, my father outside was eating not kosher. And I was not belie ving at all, and my mother was always very upset because she couldn™t understand why I cannot believe it. However, came a moment in her life when we™re thrown out Œ during the ghetto, from our apartment and we™re Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 8living not far from Umschlagplatz . You know what is Umschlagplatz ? There were the trains were loading the Jews, and the Jews were going to the trains with the name of God [indecipherable] I heard this, I remember. And she said, children, don™t believe in God. And I will never forget this because it was coming from a woman who was so blindly belie ving in God that if the hole would open in front of me, and I will go in, it would be less than to hear from my mother that there was no God. Q: Did you have any Jewish schooling? A: No. Q: Any training? A: No. I don™t know how to Œ I understand Yiddish, and now when I am working with Russian refugees, they are very happy when they hear. My Yiddish is very poor, but I can manage very nicely. And they getting much better rapport than to Œ through translator, which I always have. And since I™m Polish, I understand Russian too. Q: What language did you speak at home? A: Polish. And I was angry at my par Œ at my mother that she didn™t speak, I was ashamed a little bit that she didn™t speak a perfect Polish. However, when we came Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 9to this country and it came to my daughter friend, she said, why your mommy is talking Spanish? In her eyes it was that I was talking Spanish. Q: What were your parents™ names? A: Maria and Samuel Ma-Magitte (ph) Q: And what kind of work did your father do? A: My father had a factory, dyeing factory, where he employed 50 people. It was in his building, he had few of the real estate. He was dyeing wool, silk, [indecipherable] , rayon, felt, feathers, everything possible. And he had this Œ he came to Poland before the first war in 1914, I th ink, and he built up to Œ he was a very comfortable man. Q: So you were consid ered middle class? A: Yes, upper middle class. Q: Upper middle class. A: Yeah. Q: Mm-hm. Why did you wa nt to become a doctor? A: I loved children and I wanted to be a pe diatrician and I felt Œ although I think I was wrong because I™m very poor with science, I am rather for humanities. And it was glamorous and that™s what I ar Œ but i Œ I Œ most likely i-it Œ it was not a strong wish, because I could go abroad, my father could support me. Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 10Q: All right, well let™s come up to the time now when conditions started to change and war broke out. A: It started to change September first, immediately, the Œ our Œ Q: T-Tell me what you were doing and what you remember from then. A: September first Œ sept Œ August 31 st or 30th, I came from my boyfr Œ in Œ not Œ not even a boyfriend, a friend who is now my husband. Q: How did you meet him? A: I met him in law school when he was Œ and through his brother-in-law, who was a lawyer for my father. So when my sister was going there which was helping my father in business, she said to his brothe r-in-law, I have a very good looking sister and how about if we™ll introduce? And when he saw me he decided that he fell in love with me, most likely, but he was fighting Œ he wasn™t ready to get married, my husband. My husband was thinking about having a child with a rather healthy Christian girl. Why Christian I don™t kn ow, and to raise the child right. Q: What year did you meet your husband? A: 1935. ™36, excuse me. Q: Okay. A: And we were Œ you know, were Œ Q: And you saw each other Œ Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 11A: Yeah, but we never had a date.

I went with my girlfriend to the country, to the mountains, it was August for a few weeks and he was there coming h Œ and I saw him, he was always wearing ti ny shorts because he is a very good tennis player. So I always remember, and Œ and as a matter of fa ct, he made the ji Œ I had the cold and I was sharing the room with a girlfriend and he came in to find out about me, and he said make room. I was 20 years old and I go t very insulted and I didn™t talk to him for a week. I was very naïve, stupid. And then I saw him occasionally, but whenever, as I said never had a date. He had some girlfriends and I have some boyfriends and the life went on, and in th e ghetto when the ghetto was being closed Œ we were in the part which was ghetto , because it was a Jewish neighborhood. Q: Okay, let Œ let™s an Œ before we get to the ghetto. A: Yeah.

What other me mories do you have of that day? A: And it was a three court house. You know, in Europe mostly are courts. The first one, the second and the third. You know, in Œ it was Œ i-in New York you have very few houses where they have a court. Do you know what I™m talking? In the middle ha Œ you know, the Œ the part of the building in the middle, th-they threw the bomb and killed some tenants and [indecipherable] Q: This was your building? A: This was my building where I was living, but we™re living in the third one. Q: Yeah. A: And we™re always running to the ba sement, I remember, because they were bombing to Warsaw Œ seven days and Œ and they right away walked in. And the life changed completely. What I was doing, in the beginning were able to go to my father™ factory, which was still working, slowly. You know, it was outside of the ghetto, his factory. And Œ Q: But the ghetto hadn™t been formed yet, not Œ A: No, no. Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 13Q: Œ for another year. A: No, but you know, there were strictly Christian neighborhoods and Jewish neighborhoods. Q: You were in the Jewish neighborhood. A: Yes, I was living in the Jewish neighborhood. And then it came January 1940, my sister moved with her husband to us. She had the different apartment, but we decided to be together. Q: From September to January, you were working at your father™s factory? A: Yes, helping [indecipherable] Q: Did you have enough food? A: Yes, yes. We were comfortable, and we had jewelry which later on we™re selling to survive, so it wasn™t bad. I never suffered hunger. I Œ I didn™t have a place where to sleep later on when I was acting as a Christian, but I had money to buy food. And then in January, Gestapo came, three men from Gestapo and ask for Michael Minz(ph). And my sister grab him and run away through the kitchen entrance. That were to [indecipherable] Q: This is her husband. A: Yes. They left a note. They said that they came to Michael Minz(ph) to find out some things from him. He wasn™t from Warsaw, he was from a different small town Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 14in Poland, Midzyrzecz, and they left a note. And when my father came back Œ that he should go to the Gestapo they left a note Œ my sister didn™t want to let him go to Gestapo but my father Œ and we had a manager, my father, of this dyeing plant, who was German descent. He was Polish, but he was a Volksdeutsche. His wife immediately, you know, decided to, because they had privileges, they were like Germans. And he went with them. My sister was standing outside the Gestapo and her husband, they were married two years only, and this Œ this foreman, and they arrested him. Q: Arrested your brother-in-law? A: Yes, and since then we didn™t hear anything from them, and then we find out from other people, doctors, teachers, anybody who had some education was arrested. 300 men. My just Œ my sister got very bu sy with some lawyer s to find out what happened to them [indecipherable] . Then we find out that they were killed right away in the forest near Warsaw. This was the cream of a cream, you know, the elite of the Jewish intelligence. As a matter of fact, she had a nervous breakdown after. She became Œ she got a nervous hiccup I remember, and she was going to neurologists. We never heard from them. And then it was Œ we started to see Œ my father was extremely enterprising, decided, you know, that he will dye Œ he will be buying some linen and dyeing this home an d selling maybe to outsider, this Œ but Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 15this didn™t work. Then he started to plant some vegetables in some lots near the houses. But by the time the vegetables were ripe, they were stolen by other people. He was trying everything, he was extrem ely energetic, and Œ and he was even smuggling Œ when the factory was Œ when the ghetto was closed, to supervise the work, which it was there Œ Q: When Œ when did his factory close down? A: I don™t remember, but it was walls and walls and we didn™t let him and he was denounced by a janitor from the place where it was in the factory, that he said when Hitler will come, my father will kill him. The Christian janitor said this. They arrested my father and they put him in a space where he couldn™t stay, only he Œ he could see Œ sit with the knees, you know, like this here. In those days a number wasn™t called, they kept him 48 hours an d they let him go, and he came back. Q: What month was this? A: I don™t remember. Q: Spring of Œ A: Yeah. Q: Œ 1940. A: Yeah. It was getting worse and worse and from the small town around the war zone, which were German liquidating, they were bringing everybody to Warsaw . So Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 16we had five rooms, two rooms we ha d to let Œ to sublet for people from Lódz, two families. And the quarters are getting sma ller and smaller, we are sleeping in the dining room, we are sleep Œ an d I was sleeping together with my sister. Altogether Œ the ration was bread which wasn™t edible but [indecipherable] it was more sent that it was bread, but we didn™t suffer hunger. However, was interesting, when somebody, when the neighbors sometimes were coming, we were trying to clean up from the table, because not to show that we have food and maybe they don™t have it. And then they liquidated second part of th e ghetto which was in a different part of Warsaw and they brought ev erybody to this part where we were. Q: So your house was already in where the ghetto was Œ A: Yes, yes. Q: Okay. And the ghetto was cl osed off in October of 1940. A: Yes, but this time already we had two ghettos. In 1940, originally a different part of Warsaw had the ghetto, and where I was livi ng. Then, slowly, they liquidated the other part, and everybody was here, you know . Don™t forget the meantime they were grabbing people more and more and se nding and many people voluntary were coming because they were starving from hunger. I remember some second or third cousin came. They took away her husba nd. She came with two children to say goodbye. She said, I was told that there were work, and I will be able Œ they will Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 17support us, and she was going herself to Umschlagplatz. And there were many like this. They couldn™t survive. They were more and more dead body on the street in Warsaw, especially children, who are dying with their genitals covered with those garbage flies. It was awful. And I remember I was carrying in a packet stockings, which I was taking to somebody, you know, I Œ it is very hard for Œ when you had to run, there were people who were fixing th is. So a kid grabbed the bag from my hand and started to eat. They thought this is a br own bag, that this is food. It was getting worse and worse, you know. The Gestapo and the Germans were beating up walking on the street. You couldn™t cross the street. And the walls which they built, you know, people were smuggling because there was still some getting food. Kids were smuggling and they were killing those children near the walls, if they were carrying a bread, or something. It Œ and less and less people were, because the trains to Treblinka were going all the time. We didn™t know the Treblinka Œ some people were even getting cards, come here because we are working and everything is fine. The German machine was so sophisticated and complicated, that they could accomplish that people voluntary were going. I-It was totally unbelievable. And we were selling many things. I remember my mother had the chain which was from my grandmother, and Œ and every time, you know , we Œ we had to Œ there were still people who were selling this to the Christian. First of all, the first time we had to Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 18give away the radios, bring to the precinct. Then the fur coats. Then everything that was valuable, they could come to you and Œ and clean up the whole house, you know, yeah. And the quarters, living quarters were getting smaller and smaller. My mother was kosher, and my father brought, how you call slonina, felt from the pig? How you call in eng Œ Q: Lard? A: Lard, yeah. And h-he brought a big pi ece, and she was, you know, a Œ how you call Œ Q: Cooking? A: Not cooking only, because it was a piece, so she had to make like butter, how Œ how you say Œ Q: Melting it. A: Melting it. And she said, I™m Œ and he told her that this is lamb fat. And she said, I wonder why I didn™t Œ why we didn™t use th is before the war, it tastes so good, you know. She was very naïve in this respect. And he was much more enterprising, he was a very strong man. When you coul dn™t get coal, and our apartment were warming u Œ warm up by coal , he brought half a ton of coal up on the 10 th floor on his back. And then it came that they move d Œ they started to build the shops for German industry, you know, we were worki ng. First of all they throw us out from Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 19this apartment, there were still four of us, from the ghetto. And they took Œ they gave us one room near the Umschlagplatz where Œ Q: Do you remember when this was? A: May I ask [indecipherable] maybe he remembers? A2: [indecipherable] I remember it? Q: That™s all right, okay. A: We were there a short time. Few months, I think we were. So we left the apartment the way we were. We weren™t allowed to take anything. We went down and I will never Œ one room and it happened that this apartment, I met later a woman who survived Russia, was her parents™ apartment. I will never forget this apartment because the bedbugs were coming from the ceiling. Q: This is the new place? A: The new place, yeah. And it was a balcony and we heard the trains coming and the Jews going to the train, and praying to God. And it was constant. The trains were going constantly. And then they opened th e Germans shops, and we were able Œ I and my Œ my mother, when we ™re going to the shops we™re hiding her. We put a big closet, you know, and cover part of the wall and [indecipherable] because she couldn™t work. She Œ she had heavy arthritis and she was overweight. So my father was working in a different shop and my sister and myself were working not far from Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 20my father in a different shop. The name of the shop was [indecipherable] roefrich, r-o-e-f-r-i-c-h, from [indecipherable] and we™re sewing uniforms. There I met part Jews, which I never met before, it was the working class of Jews. Bund, b-u-n-d. And they were singing the Jewish songs very, you know [indecipherable] you know, all those [indecipherable] and Œ you know, and they were those one who started later the uprising. They were very, very important Jews that I met in my life, which some of them survived. And they were much more doing for the Jews than people like me, who was a Jewish princess. And then we™re sewing, but then started selection. All the time the Gestapo was coming. We all had to go outside and they were looking if there were older people or some people who had the pimple on the nose or something, they were taking away . And meantime there was, in 1942, the street of Œ name was Millar(ph) and this time was a big selection and they took tremendous amount of Jews. And I will never forget my neighbors, who had the little girl Marilka (ph) and they put her in a suitc ase and they made holes in the suitcase for air. However, she started to cry. They were living on the same house, and Germans put the cara Œ machi Œ guns, and sh ot this suitcase, as Œ this couple left the suitcase and walked away. There are things which always stays in your mind. So there were less and less Jews in the ghetto because they were killed, or they were taking to Treblinka. We didn™t notice the Œ there were some people who are coming Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 21from Treblinka who threw themselves together with the clothing, because they were telling them that you have to go and you know, to the shower and this Œ those things, you know. So, you know, some of them who are helping to sort the clothes into this, th-the shoes, and Œ th-they got back to Warsaw and they say remember, Treblinka has ba Œ is burning Œ crematoriums are working day and night. So with that already, the idea that this is not that they are sending them to work, only they are sending them to be killed. Q: So you were called out some Œ for selections that time? A: I was not, no, because we™re young. My sister and I were young, and my father, who was this time in the late 50™s was hiding when they were calling. You know, you never knew for whom they we re looking. However, one week Œ Q: Were you ever called down to Œ to the street? You were never called down to Œ A: No. Q: No. A: However, once we came, and the hot soup was on the table, my mother was gone. She came out from this hiding place to cook the soup for us, and they came and they took her away. I run to Umschlagplatz, but she was gone. We continued work, and once I came and I heard that they took my sister. And I went to Umschlagplatz and they told me that she was on this and this train, which was staying, and I entered the Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 22train. When I was in the train, they told me that my sister was hiding, that she wasn™t on that train, and I decided to jump. It wa sn™t Œ the train was just moving, so I Œ I wasn™t a heroine, you know. They helped me, you know, and they picked me up and through the window, because the doors were locked. My sister heard that I was in the train, she went to the other train. She was extr Œ extremely important to me. In the same time, we jumped from two different wagons and we met on the outside of the train and we went back to the ghetto. And my father was sitting on the floor near the door. He said, I knew that you will come back. We decided that we have to do something to leave the ghetto because we didn™t have a chance. My father knew a man, a Christian, he was a lawyer, who took over the management of his factory. And through him we got false papers for my sister and for myself. I was looking more like Christian than her, because the whole Jewish tragedy was in her eyes. You know, they say [indecipherable] in Jewish eyes, there is such a thing. I was always smiling and Œ and really, although Œ and my Polish and her Polish was excellent, and this was extremely important. And we said Œ and it was very hard for her to move around because she could be very easy recognized. So through this man he found somebody, and she was sitting mostly inside. This was April, before the uprising. Q: April 1943. Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 23A: Yes. And I got papers too, and I went Œ I rented somebody Œ my friend told me that she™s coming back to the ghetto because her husband Œ as a man you didn™t have a chance, because of circumcision. And I took over her room. And I was working in the ghetto as a Christian this time. I could see my father, I had papers as a Christian. Q: What kind of work were you doing? A: This was factory for Germany. Q: Manufacturing work. A: Yeah, I was very gutsy. They were making Œ I Œ from lead or something. It was a short time. I was coming in the morning, an d leaving five o™clock. This time I could al Œ I could always bring for my fath er some food, who was in a different [indecipherable] this time. My sister was already on the false paper hidden, you know. And then it was Passover, the first Seder, Sunday night and I stayed, I wanted to be with my father. And he asked me stay there today, maybe it was Sunday night. I say okay, I will stay. And the next morning when I got up, it was Monday, I found out that the uprising was, but it was in different Œ it was in the part of the ghetto where my husband was. And I got dressed, I had the coat with the collar from a rabbit. Jews weren™t allowed, so when I went to the false paper, I bought myself a rabbit and I put to my coat to look more like Christian. And I went to the guard and I passed the Œ it was a house ba Œ from Œ who had two entrances from the street. The Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 24Jews in towers were staying in the court and praying to God. It was quiet in this part of the ghetto because the uprising started there. And I went to the guard, I showed him the papers. He said, what you are doing in the ghetto? I said [indecipherable] caught me, and I decided I didn™t have a ch oice, I had to stay. He looked at me, he looked at the paper, and as I say, the number was [indecipherable] and he let me through. And near the guard were children six, seven years old, Jude, Jude , waiting for the Jews to show them to the German. I had guts, and I walked in with my head up. And my sister, maybe one street from there she was waiting. She knew that to get out I had to come there. She knew that Œ she was sure that she will never see me. And I met her and I said, don™t go in th ere, because it was the worst time. The Polacks were showing left and right, you know, and they could recognize me. No Germans stopped me in two and a half ye ars. But the Polacks, who knew me from university one, my husb Œ my father™s work and Œ and luckily that I had money, because this man, my father gave him money, and whenever I needed. And there was incident when I was living in the room, in the furnished room, there was a little boy, the first question he asked me, if I ever saw a Jew. So I said yes. Is this true that Jew have a tail? I said, I don™t think so, but I don™t know. And when they started the uprising in ghetto, I Œ I knew that I have a father there and I had a husband Œ husband, not a husband, we weren™t offici ally married, but I Œ I felt, you know. I Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 25went to the wall, and I was looking and next to me was standing a Christian woman and she said, very good that they burning the Jews, only they spoiling our Easter. This was vox populi, it wasn™t a single voice, everybody felt the same way. As I was living in this furnished room, once is coming a woman and she said to me, may I see your papers? I said yes. What happe ned to the woman which was living here before, she was Jewish, are you Jewish, too? I said, I don™t know if Œ I never met her, but I™m not Jewish. She said, anyway, we™ll go to Gestapo. She Œ it was after the curfew. She was a Polish woman, but she was working for the Germans, and she Œ we™re walking, it was quite a walk. We were walking, I said look, I can give you money, I have a watch, let me go. She said no, we™re going. Suddenly she got tremendous pain, and we stopped near the pharmacy where she was ringing the bell, it was after the curfew. And the owner was living in the same building, opened the door for us, and we walked in and she said to him, if you will let her go, she is Jewish, you will be killed too. You have to help me. And he gave her some medication, I don™t remember, and she co ntinued to walk with me. We™re maybe quarter of a mile from Gestapo, she said gi ve me the money and give me the watch. I will [indecipherable] but I will not do anything to you. And I didn™t move. I get out from this room and I didn™t have a place where to go. I went to the hotel in a very nice neighborhood in Warsaw , Marshal(ph) Kostka (ph) street. And the man Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 26who took my papers said, I am sure your papers are all right because Gestapo is coming every night and checking the papers. I didn™t have a choice. I said, my papers are okay. And I was sleeping ther e, nobody came. And I was looking through the window, and I wanted to commit suicide. I had nothing to lose. And I said, if they will find me, they will not know even who am I. But I was young, an-and I said no, you cannot give up. And the next morning I walked on the street, and I met my friend, a Jewish woman who was working as a governess, French governess. She was studying medicine in France and her French was perfect and we were very friendly. She was working for a very nice family. She was taking care of two girls. And she said Œ I said, Marisha(ph), I don™t have a place where to go. She said, today we™re interviewing for my woman wher e I™m working. She has a mother in a small town [indecipherable] and we™re looking for a housekeeper. You come and I am going to interview, and you™ll get the job. I went for the in terview, you know, it was like I Œ I am talking to you and I think I am lying. I-It™s hard to believe. I went there and this woman came to see me and then she said to her, you know what? She looks a little bit Jewish. But she was a nice woman. She said oh no, you know, she™s from a different town only. Because my papers were from a small town, from Czstochowa, and I went there. Q: What was your name then? Were you Œ Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 27A: Stefania (ph) Dolinska(ph). I have the Kennekarta. And I was two years older from 1917, and the parents were illiterate, you know, I Œ I had to Œ to have a family. So wherever I went I had an aunt, an uncle, you know, everything was fiction.

A: And this Œ there was a well known shrine of Saint Mary , she was black, that Matka Czstochowska, yeah. Very well known. And I was carry Œ wearing, of course, a big cross and all the things. And if you would wa ke me up during the night, I could recite all the Catholic prayers by heart. Q: How did you learn them? A: I learned. I got the book and I Œ this was survival. And I went there and the Œ wa Œ one was deaf and one was blind. And I wasn™t prepared to work, I was a Jewish princess, I got the wrong educ ation. And when I cook po tatoes I didn™t know that you need water. So I felt the potatoes will give waters all when they started. When Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 28she walked in she said oh, Stefcha(ph) forgot to put Œ not enough water. So it dawned on me. They once were going to confession, so she said, let™s hurry, because I was going to church with them. I said yes, only I will finish my breakfast. I forgot that when you going to conf ession, you don™t eat anything before. You know, they were such a little things which Œ here I am coming from a family which wasn™t assimilated one and here I am suddenly a Christian. The best place was ch-church. Then nobody was touching you, you know, you were pretending that you praying and you cover your eyes. But I-I was working. Like, I was washing the floors, I put sud on the floor and then you Œ you had to put clear water to remove the soap. So I was swimming in the sud and I didn™t know that you need clear water. And I was there and it was rather good, you know. I Œ my sister, before I left, she dye my hair, you know, blonde. And I couldn™t become blonde somehow, I Œ I™m very dark, now I color. And I was a reddish hair, but I wa s good looking and I had guts, you know, yeah, I Œ and my eyes were happy. And I was working there for a short time and then I went to Warsaw. I Œ for Œ I was going for weekend, I Œ I said that I had Œ and [indecipherable] said, oh good that Stefcha(ph) because the [indecipherable] came and he is checking everybody™s paper, so I said that you will come tonight. I say, oh I am so sorry. My aunt got very sick and I have to stay with [indecipherable] it was split of a second. I came only to get Œ I had a small suitcase, and a pillow you know, Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 29I was carrying here like Œ because this was a Œ the servants were, pillow and a blanket, you know, you Œ you needed your own. She sa ys, oh please tell him that when my aunt will get better, I will come back and I will go to him. And I disappeared. Q: Let™s go back. Did you ever go to confession in the church? A: No. I said that I am going, but I didn™t. And Œ but I was going to communion, you know, and I was whe Œ Q: You took communion? A: And I went to Warsaw and I had a friend who was looking very Jewish. Her name was Roma, too. This is the same friend that when he came and he saw the name, you know, he thought this is a ma n, yeah. She was living with her mother. Her mother Jewish was atrocious Œ Polish was atrocious, so she pretended that she was mute. However, my friend had very curly hair like black, like afro, so she couldn™t leave the house, so the mother was coming out a nd going, you know, shopping, pointing, you know, the Œ and the daughter was always home. So whenever I was desperate, which was not fair to them, I was going to them for the night when it was dark, and the janitor was the biggest enemy. Sneaking, and spending the night. Q: What was her name? Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 30A: Roma Fleischman(ph). The mother was a wa Œ I was telling them when we™re sitting there, the first train I will be sitting, and the mother said no, we™ll stay here. And then, you know, I heard that there is a job on a farm, to milk the cows, to help with the far Œ I was all used to farm like Œ now I would go, maybe as astronaut I would be better. So I went there and there was a wife after a Œ a Œ a widow after a judge and a big farm. And she said to me , do you know how to milk the cow? I figured, what™s a Œ wha-what™s so easy th Œ bi-big deal, you know? I was wearing silk stockings, and my Polish was so go od and my handwriting was so good. You know, for a maid in Poland, who were mostly illiterate, but I told them that I was working as a bookkeeper in this different city. So now I Œ since I moved, my parents die, everybody, you know, to convenience. Sometimes they were alive, sometimes they were dead. And she says okay, so milk this cow. I started to pull, kill me, couldn™t get a drop of milk and the flies were biting me through the stockings and the cow was hitting me with the tail. And Œ and she looked at me, she said, you don™t look like a girl who knows Œ who was working on a farm. I am sorry, but I cannot keep you. I left again. In between there, there were jobs where I felt that this is not safe, that I have to leave, you know. So after two days I was leaving without, you know, and I didn't Œ I had working papers, which we re extremely important. By Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 31the way, I forgot to tell you, when I was going to get my Kennekarta (ph) with my birth certificate, which I got to my hand Œ End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B A: Œ I got my false paper, I needed a Kennkarta , which was the official germ Œ German document to live in occupied Poland. And when I went on the way there to this German office where they were giving the Kennkarta with my picture, I had a picture with my nose like this, I Œ you will see the picture. And on the way there somebody stole from me the Œ the Œ my po cketbook. And I didn™t have the birth certificate. And I called up this man, Mr. Rokulski(ph), he said, I cannot get Œ you have to go to the Church of che Œ of Three Crosses, that was a big church in Poland, and ask for the birth certificate. I didn™t ha ve a choice, this was like Œ like going in a Œ in a mousetrap and I went there and I as k and they gave me. I don™t know if she was alive or she was dead, you know? Could be if I would ask for death certificate, they would give me too. So again I went and I got the Kennkarta which w Œ and a arbeitskarta , work paper, which was extremely important because when the Germans were stopping me, when I had the arbeitkarta, this work karta , they let me loose. My dream was to get to Germany, to work in Germany as a Polish girl. However, you couldn™t volunteer, because if they would see a woman like me Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 32volunteer, there was a priest who was spec ializing in recognizing Jews. He would see right away that the woman, you know, with my Polish, is not voluntary to go to work as a Œ in labor camp. So my only hope was to be caught by the German, and to send to Germany . But because of my arbeitkarta, they never Œ I went to library, the ju Œ Gestapo came to library. I showed them my paper, they let me loose. And Œ Q: You were Œ you were talki ng about you left the farm Œ A: I left the farm. Q: Œ where Œ where you couldn™t milk the cow, and then what happened? A: Yeah, and I looked and I-I Œ I was at the end Œ I Œ I Œ I looked in the paper. However, it Œ it was Œ I went on Œ on anot her job where I was two days. And the man Œ I didn™t Œ the man was looking at me very suspicious. You know, you develop a different sense, where is Œ wh-where you are not sure if Œ if you will not be caught, you know, yeah. And it was split of a second was deciding about your life. So I flew down to that Œ near Warsaw was a summer place where they were before the war sending TB patients. Otwotski(ph), it was. And they are looking for people to Œ chambermaids and other worker s to change from that hotel to hospital for German soldiers. So I went there. It was run Œ su pervised by nuns, and I was working there, it was empty. They were preparing for the German soldiers. Q: What time of year was this? Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 33A: It was summer. Q: Summer ™44? A: Yes. Q: And I was there and so I read, you know, from the employment, a German employment that they are looking for a governess in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Garmisch-Partenkirchen was Hitler ™ summer home. And intelligent, educated and I went there to this office. Well, the moment I walked in, I saw that I made a mistake. There was sitting a Polis Deutsche, a Polack who was a German, a German descent. And I remember him when I was working when the ghetto started. You know, they took the Jews to work to put the names in every building, you know, who were Œ and he was there. And I Œ you know, I figure out he couldn™t recognize me, but I Œ when I saw him, he was talking Polish. And I ask about the job, he said yes, yes, I will let you know. Where are you now? I said, I am here in this, I am working here and here. When I came back to this place where I was working, the nun was waiting for me with a Œ my little suitcase. And she said, ste Œ Stefsha(ph), right away go to back Warsaw because Gestapo is coming to arrest you. They recognize you. She took me to the train. I said, but I don™t have a place where to go. She said, go to th Œ our convent. She gave me the name of this Mother Superior in Warsaw and I went there. And they talked to me, they say we don™t have a place Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 34where to keep you for the night, but we have in the country a place, a convent. Take the train and go there. I spent Œ they kept me three months there. Q: What convent was it? A: Marie™s family Œ Mary™s family. Regina Mary. The priest knew that I am Jewish, the nuns didn™t know. I shared th e room with a nun who was shaved like [indecipherable] you know. And since I am very curious, I was asking what made them become a nun, so I™m Œ different stor y was there. And they had some Jewish children there in this convent. The ones that Œ I was working on the f Œ that was gardening, and they were, you know, vegetables, things , all I Œ and going Œ four o™clock in the morning we™re going to church. And it was already cold, it was coming winter. Q: What town was this in? A: Grodzisko Mazovieke, g-r-o-d-z-i-s-k-o, one word. Mazovieke, m-a-z-o-v-i-ek-e. And he said, I am very sorry, but you cannot stay here any more, because we™ll jeopardize the life of the children. And people are asking question what Œ I wasn™t a nun, you know, I was in my normal thing. I said, so Œ but I have no place where to go, so they sent me back. I ca Œ boug ht the paper, and it was my last job in Warsaw and they said in case they will need reference, I can give them their references, which was extremely important. Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 35Q: You had stayed there three months? A: Yeah. After the three months, you know, in the country. And I started to work with a woman who was a white Russian. She was Russian Orthodox. You know, ye Œ after the revolution in Russia, there were white Russian we Œ who went to Poland, to China , to all over the world. And he was a Volksdeutsche, again. He recognize me, but I was good for him and he was good for me, because he knew that is coming end of the war, and he had the uniform. Once, I took the uniform and I put on the balcony, and I thought that he will kill me. He grabbed the uniform because he didn™t want any Polacks to know that he™s a Volksdeutsche. You know, Volksdeutsche was a person who was born from German descent. Lempke(ph) was his name. It was and it wasn™t a German name, but it was convenient. He got the Polish villa in the country from a Œ a Œ a Jewish villa, where Jews used to go, a beautiful apartment and he awa Œ had a se wing Œ a salon, you know, where she had the manager, and women sewing dresses ma de to order. Everything that they had was from Jews, different monograms, you know. And th Œ he had girlfriend, because when the telephone was ringing, when I was picking up, nobody answered. However, when he was picki ng up, he was oh, how are you Mrs. this and this, you know. And she was older than him, and sh e had the dog, a Peki nese dog who hated my guts, the dog. I hated the dog, too. I wa s sleeping dressed up Œ dressed. I couldn't Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 36get undressed because I felt in case somebody will come from the front door, I will be able to run through the back door. An d I was singing in there, you know, it was curfew hours, eight o™clock. I was singing in Œ every home had the altar. So who was singing? The maids were singing. And everybody was sending the maids to sing and to pray in the altar. I, who doesn™t have any Œ if you would hear me singing, like my husband said, [indecipherable] this, I wasn™t a main singer that, you know. And then, once I Œ I didn™t know how to cook, and she knew it that I don™t know. Yeah, I could Œ so she had the big party and she called a special wo Œ a woman who was a cook. And I was wearing a Œ whatever I was wearing, she was asking me where I was buying. I said, oh, I bought this in a flea market. And she said, it looks like a Œ from a rich Jewish woman. Those were my own things, few things that I had, the black dress with a pin something. And I was wearing a black dress and a white a Œ white, you know, apron, and I walked to the room and I saw a German sitting in the uniform among her guests. And I got so scared that I fell down, together with a tray, with the food on the tray. She didn't kill me this time, was Œ once he threw the shoe in my head, this guy, that I didn™t do a good job. And you know, we™re picked together, this is not important. When we went Œ it was Easter, ™44 Œ went to the summer place. And this is a custom among Christian, that you share the egg, the hard Œ and you exchange wishes. I don™t know if you know about. Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 37Q: Where was this? A: In the country, in the summer place with those people. And she said to me, oh, the war is almost over. You will not be the maid any more, but Stefcha(ph) has a very good taste, so you will be supervising my salon and cleaning only the salon. So she looked at her and said, I think that after the war yo u will be working for her. I can bet you she™s a daughter of a rich indust Œ [indecipherable] and not watch only Warsaw. And then we went to church and he was watching every step if I didn™t many any mistake, but I was smarter than hi m. When to knee, when to cross, when to this, when to that. And then to get started the uprising, August first in Warsaw. The Polish uprising, had nothing to do wi th Jewish. And the Ge rmans Œ the Russians stopped on the outskirts of Œ Warsaw was divided by Vistula. It was Praga, which was the outskirts part of Warsaw, but it was outskirts o Œ actually, and Warsaw. The Russian decided to conquer the Warsaw , but the Polacks say oh no, they were Œ they were their worst enemies. When th e rush Œ when the Russians are already on the water Vistula, now we™ll fight for Warsaw. But this was impossible, because the Germans were still very strong, and the Russians said okay, let the Polacks fight their own battles. We™re not moving. And the Germans again Œ and when I told to this my Œ this woman for whom I was working, I said, I am Jewish. She said, and Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 38your mother for sure was selling herrings on the flea market, she said to me. She was so angry. She hated the Jews so much, it™s Œ Q: Why did you tell her you were Jewish? A: Because I thought this is the end, but it wasn™t the end. You know, when the Russian were coming, and it was an hour away, but they stop because the stupid Polacks, they said, we™re going to fight for our capital. So it was not here and not there. October 15, evacuate the whole Warsaw . Many Jews were killed who were kill Œ who were hidden. My friend from Australia was staying in the sewers with rats and mice and her legs when she came out were so swollen, because Warsaw was totally flat now. We had one skyscraper, 14 floors, it went, I saw it. And they were flying so low, the Germans, that we™re hidden in the basement and part of the basement was destroyed because Poland didn™t have anything to defend. They didn™t have before and they didn™t have fo r sure later. And the Russian didn™t move. And they put us on the trains. Q: So you went back to Œ you went back into Warsaw?

And I tell you, since he was a Volksdeutsche and he suspected that I was Jewish, but I Œ I didn™t have a place where to go any more, you kn ow, we to Œ I was in so many places, I was Œ when I went to the butcher to buy, you know, something for the people I was working, when he looked at me I saw that he didn™t look at me because I was good looking, or young. I Œ I didn't Œ you know, right away I said, oh you don™t have this? I disappeared, you know? It was everything split of a second that you didn™t make Œ I didn™t tell you something that was important, how I lost my sister and my father. Can I go back? Q: Absolutely. A: My father Œ so we were both on false papers. May eighth Œ May eighth, or maybe May six, my father through the sewers escaped from the ghetto.

The Germans stopped him because it was nighttime, and they ask him what he was doing, he said, I was cleaning the sewers. And he knew to cross himself and he went to his worker. This was a third generation worker who was working for him. And he knew my tele phone number and he called me up and he said, you have to take my Œ your father be cause I have a family, I cannot keep him. And I got in touch with my sister, we didn™t know what to do with him. And as I was walking, I met Œ everything was li-like Œ like fate. I believe in fate. I was walking on the street and I met a young man who was working f-from a different city, who was living in the house where I was living with my parents, during the war. He came from a different Œ and I don™t remember his name. And I said, I don™t know what to do, but my father is here and I don™t have where to put him. He said look, my father is hidden and my whole family is supposed to come but suddenly was the uprising and they couldn™t leave the ghetto. I am very ha ppy that I met you because my father is getting crazy being there all alone. Well right away I picked up my father night time, you know, before the curfew and my sister put him there.

Polacks, all were mostly Polacks. This was the worst time for Jews who Œ which were hidden, because they were the Œ the color of the walls, you know, they were hidden. They didn™t see fresh air for so many years, so when they were coming out from those hidden places, you could recognize them right away. I was looking like milk and honey. I never suffered hunger. I Œ you know, my eyes were smiling, and Œ and I had guts. So when we got there, the woman was an alcoholic, a very charming woman, a teacher from profession, whose husband was living with a young girl wh o was Jewish, was hi Œ who Œ whom she was hiding.

And I went to my Œ I went to Warsaw , it was frozen, everything. Totally frozen, it was a very strong winter. The Russians were coming and they were looking like beggars.

Zamenhof was a guy who this Œ who started Esperanto, you know. And I were Œ and grass was growing there, and I was very glad that there was no sign of this house.

Even with a strong club, that would happen. This is the way I feel. And the more, you know, and Œ and I was maybe selfish because I wanted to save my own feelings. I didn™t want to come and to talk and to dig out and then Œ but at certain moment it was pressure from our son, too, who is a psychiatrist, so Œ and he sa id, I remember the holidays and always you were crying. You know, when Passover, it was Seder or something like this. And Œ and you were always talki ng how was it, you know, and Œ and the memories and he said now Œ now that we have holidays, mo stly we™re going to her Œ to my daughter- Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 57in-law parents, which are second generate Œ first gen Œ her parents were Œ her parents were from Hungary or Romania and he is too, but they are totally Americanized, very well-to-do people.

And she reads in Yiddish, you know, about the [indecipherable] ghetto and my son writes in English. And it has a meaning, you know? I became more, not religious, only more traditional, you know, yeah. And I feel this is very little ah Œ I wou Œ if Œ if my son wouldn™t be born here, we wo uldn™t circumcise him most likely. And anyway, he was circumcised by the doctor, not by a moyl. A-And Œ however, he Œ now that I have three grandson, wonderful three boys, and I-I would like Œ I would like a ni Œ and I don™t know if I would like because for example, after the war, that I didn™t know that my husband survive or no, I could never marry the Gentile. And many people just drop Œ they said Œ which, you cannot blame them, decided enough of being Jewish. When I decided to go back to school, you know, I didn™t know Œ I Œ I wanted to be a librarian because I liked to read, but then I was discouraged. And then after thinking over and between my husband and my son, you know, they said that I Œ I Œ I Œ I should help people, you know. So I was work ing, when I got my Master™s degree in a state mental institution for 13 years, which wasn™t that Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 58rewarding because I couldn™t do too much for them and you need some happy ending. But I Œ even there, I was exposed to tremendous suffering, which to compare to my, you know, those were people which were out, totally. They di Œ they didn™t know what Œ they were for 50 years in a mental institution. And then when it came the time for psychotropic drugs, you kno w, they started to give them, and Œ and then they started to discharge them to nursing home which were worse than hell. And it Œ through all those years I did lots of growing you know, between the war and between my work, you know, I became extremely Œ much more tolerant and Œ and a much better person than I ever would be, even not all those things. That™s it. Q: That™s it? Oh Œ [tape break] A: Going back to my life during Œ starting August first, where it was uprising, Polish uprising in Warsaw. There was time where there was nothing to eat because Warsaw was surrounded by Germans, and on the wa Œ Vistula river by Russia there was no food coming in. All the horses were eaten up. This reminds me on the revolution in France when they were eating rats and mice. There was Œ this was Armia Ludowa and Armia Krajowa. This was one which was to the left and one was to the right. The Armia Krajowa was very much against Jews. I was working there as a clerical person for awhile Œ End of Tape One, Side B Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 59Beginning Tape Two, Side A A: Œ Jewish, and I was working in the bui lding there, who belongs to well know Emil Wedel, who was German descent, but he ne ver declared himself as a German. There was a Œ one of the best factory of chocolate which existed now, E. Wedel, w-e-d-e-l. And I Œ the people were Œ for whom I wa s working as a maid were Œ had the apartment in the same building and the ones, the soldiers who were fighting, the Polish soldiers, not officially soldiers, but to defend Warsaw , they were cooking in our court, this was barley and some kasha, and they were Œ supposedly told me that it was a horse, but then we find out that it was a Œ a dog Œ a dachshund who belong to a well known Polish writer, Maria Rodzewiczkofna, very hard name to pronounce, r-o-d-z-e-w-i-c-z-k-o-f-n-a. And then, the second time they caught some kids, I don™t know where, because the uprising started August first and it was til October where the Polish people have to capitulate because the Germans by air were throwing bombs and marching, occupying back the Warsaw which for a short time was in Polish hands. And there it was a cat cooked together with all the ingredients. When I ate this I didn't know, I didn™t ge t sick, but I was young, and actually it didn™t matter what I was eating. Q: When you found out. Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 60A: When I found out, yeah. But then it was written a book by somebody, by a Polish writer and she mentioned this [indecipherable] dog. I don™t know if the dog has a name. But anything that was alive those days was doomed to be killed for food. One of the Œ after the war, when we™re Œ I was working with my husband in Lódz and I saw Mrs. Lempke(ph). This was the woman which Œ where I was working on my last job on a maid. She didn't see me, and I said to my husband, you should hit her a few times. And my husband said, she is a head taller than me, how can I do it? And she wasn™t good to you, you survi Œ she wa sn™t bad to you, you survive. So why Œ why do you want me to harm her? I cannot do anything, right? And this was the end. But I had a strange feeling that always I would Œ I-I would never go back to Poland, never, never. Now we™re Œ financially we™re okay, that is out of question, but I remember when we we™re struggling, I always used to say, if anybody would put a million dollars under condition that we™ll go to Poland to visit, I wouldn™t go. I hate everything that they did for us. And I hated that in a normal country like Denmark, even French were Œ was a excellent underground, although they have their own Gestapo, Maquis and in other countries you hear so many beautiful stories. And that™s true that the nuns helped me, and there were other Polacks, but it is such a small percentage. Well, a Œ mostly a Œ were Œ where we had th-three and a half million Jews living in Poland , well before Germans enter Warsaw, the Polish Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 61people already was beating us up. The Œ before the war, you know, the Œ there was tremendous hatred always. And I am sorry that I was born in Poland, not here. Joe? Q: Any other Œ A: Do you want Œ Q: Œ stories that you remember, that you would like to add, any other Œ A: I tell you, I had a good childhood, an d I was 20 years old in 1939, and looking back, you know, maybe I didn™t know any better. However, when I think Œ when I got my Œ graduated gymnasium, I thought th at I would conquer the world. I had so many dreams which were never fulfilled, and I didn™t realize, maybe because I was stupid, or young, that so many things were off the limits for us Jews in Poland . They were talking about engineers jokingly, that they are to measure the street. The doctors, if they didn™t marry the rich girl, he couldn™t open the office. Lawyers, the bar were closed for Jewish lawyers, young one. A Jew couldn't be a janitor, a Jew couldn™t be a chimney cleaner. A Jew couldn ™t get a city job. And now living here for 44 years and to see what the opportunities everybod y can have, I am for sure reinforce that it was the wrong place of birth for us. And I see how people are coming from different country, working in my capacity, what the help they getting, what the chances they have to be somebody, to develop, to educate. To compare to Interview with Roma na Koplewicz October 8, 1993 62Poland and being born and being Polish citizen and fighting the Polish wars, we couldn™t get any place. That™s it. Whatever I will say more will be [indecipherable] Q: Well, thank you again for doing the interview. A: Thank you for listening to us.
