ILSE SAUER August 21, 1995 QUESTION: Ilse Sauer, if you would just begin by telling me your name, date of birth and where you were born. ANSWER: Okay. My name is Isle Sauer, nee Ilsedore Rudolphosou. I was born in 1923 in Penslo (ph.), a small town north of Berlin. Q: Tell me a little bit about your family and your town. A: I was an only child. My parent s got married pretty late in life and -- and our life in Penslo was my early childhood what was quite normal. We had a sizable Jewi sh community in Penslo. There were a number of Jewish famili es. We had a beautiful synogog ue and we, children, later on attended religious school there. Well, when I was six years old I star ted public school and after four years of elementary school I was awarded a scholarship to a lyceum and an all girls academic high school, but before my first year there was over my scholarship was revoked and I was notified that we would no longer welcome at that school. So all -- because I was Jewish. And -- Q: What year was that? A: It was in 1943 -- 1934. Excuse me. It was in 1934 and already at that time th e anti-semitism in Penslo was quite wide sp read as it was in many smaller towns. Q: Now, what kind of bus iness was your father in? A: My father was, what you w ould probably call a commercial arti st. He mainly concentrated on designs for embroidery. In those days there were a lot of fancy embroidery of table clothes and linen and everything and that was his main occupa tion. And -- Q: Was your lifestyle fairly comfortable? A: Our lifestyle was -- yes, was a middle - middle class Jewish family. We lived quite comfortably and in the beginning in my early childhood everything was all right. Then when I had to leave the special school I was forc ed to go back to the public school which in th ose days public education lasted for eight years an d I graduated in 1937 at the age of 14. Because there were no 2 opportunity of me in Penslo my parents sent me to a Jewish hous ehold school in the suburbs of Berlin which was actually to learn all kinds of domestic skills including child care. During that year my parents moved to Berlin into an apartment in an apartment house. Beca use life in Penslo had become intolerable. Q: Let me ask you a question before you go on. Did -- was your family religious? A: No. My family was actually not religious as such. My father especi ally was a stanch (ph.) cellar (ph.) Jew who would fight for his Judaism any chance he would get. See, in those years Jews were already taunted a lot, being called names an d even physically pushed around and my father would go out at night with his snappy walking st ick and when somebody would taunt him or he would come across a young Na zi boy he would try to hit them with his cane which sometimes got him into trouble and my mother was always worried about him. Q: I'm trying to get a sense of just the build up on the anti-semitism and whether this was a fact of life before Hitler came to powe r and how it progressed. A: It was already before Hitler came to power. There were already signs of anti-semitism and then when Hitler came to power, as I said, in 1934 most of the men had joined the Nazi party. The youngsters were in the Hitler youth and they had horrast us Jews quite a bit. Q: In what way? A: Well, they would call us na mes. They sometimes would push me around in school and out. They were belittling us and, you know , it was not too pleasant. I mea n, some of the Gentiles, I had some Gentile girlfriends, but late r on when they joined the Hitler youth they were so brainwashed against Jews that former friends would not dare to associate with a Jew an y longer. Because in a small town, you know, ever ybody knew everybody. It was different in a large city like Jovian (ph.). Q: How did you make sense of it? Did you talk about it with your parents? A: Yes, certainly we talked with my parents also with other youngsters. You know, we were talking about these things. About -- they were invisible becaus e, you know, the Na zis got stronger and stronger and life b ecame more difficult. Q: Did your parents have any lose of 3 ____________ in their life? A: Yes. We had -- we were desperately trying to get out of Germany. And my parents really never had a chance. We had no relatives in America who could have sent us an affidavit or any place else where we could have gotten us out. The only possibilities for my parents were either to go to Palestine or to Shanghai in China which my father was afraid he would not tolerate the climate because he was suffering from aths ma. Then my parents at least wa nted me to get out and I had a fairly good chance. The director of the household school in Berlin had immigrated to England and she opened a children's home there. She sent papers to some of us young gi rls to come to England and work with her in the children's home, but somehow the papers me ant for me got lost. I have a feeling they must have b een sold to somebody and by the time the director was able to make out new papers it, unfortunately, was too late. So in 1938 when I came back from household school and moved in with my parents again th e persecution of Jews in Berlin had become quite bad already and then later on we were forced to wear the Jewish star. We had to take the added first names of Sarah and Isreal. Doctors, lawy ers and other professionals could no lo nger attend to their professions. Jews were not allowed in the university. In fact, already in '39 we were not allowed to go to the theater, to the opera, the movies even. So our life was very limited for us. Q: What -- were you -- did you se e a lot of difficulties in the stre ets or round ups, anything like that? A: Well, yes. ______ ______ happened on N ovember 9, 1938 and I saw the destruction of Jewish business' and Jewish home s and there was terrible vandalism and it was just a horrible sight. Fortunately, somehow they missed our apartment and we were not directly affected by that. Q: Did you hear it happe n at the ____ ________? A: Yes. Well, heard what went on. We also, you know, if you live d in Berlin was pretty close to the sports palace in which Hitler frequently spoke. So right near our house we had these parades of Hitler and his whole enteras coming around quite fr equently. That was about what happened in those years. You know -- Q: Did you feel at risk when you saw these parades come on? 4 A: Well, you were always at risk especially, you know, on ce we start wearing the Jewish star, but -- well, fortunately, I -- I, personall y, my parents, we were never really bothered too much by that. I mean, we could not associate with Gentiles anymore. In fact, one of my father's brothers had been married to a Gentile woman for years. In fact, he had converted to Christianity and the brothers could not see each other because they were afraid to be se en with Jews because -- Q: This is a bit of a digression, but what happened to that brother? A: That brother surviv ed in Berlin, yeah. Q: As a Christian? A: As a Christian which was unusual because I kno w of other people where one spouse was Jewish and the other spouse had to suff er for it and also wa s reported, so that was quite unusual. Q: Was there, kind of an inwa rd growth of the Jewish communit y because you were so isolated from the rest of the city? A: Yes. In a way it was, of course, you know, we moved to Berlin late, so we really didn't have too many friends. We had relatives in Berlin and on the outskirts of Berlin I had an aunt who had a beautiful villa in a beauti ful suburb of Berlin wher e I actually had spent a lot of my school vacation when we still lived in Penslo. And my mother had sisters in Berlin and some of us were together mostly with family and relatives in -- in Jewish France. Q: Was -- I mean, were there ever by the Jewish community to kind of take care of -- take care of each other? A: Yes, there were. You know, the Jewish comm unity set up a lot of op portunities for us Jews especially us Jewish youngsters. For instance, in 1940 I found out that the Jewish community had established some dress making courses and I enrolled in one of these courses. Unfortunately I could not quite finish it because before the end of it I was ordered to forc e labor. That was in April of 1941. And the forced labor I had to do was in a larg e commercial laundry on the outskirts of Berlin. I had quite a lengthy train ride getting there. At that time the war in Europe was on and British bombers would come over Berlin practically every night and bomb Berlin. So we, Jewish, forced labors worked on the four p.m. to midnight shift and we had to so rt dirty laundry for the German 5 army. Well, on my way home after midnight I was usua lly caught in an air raid on the train and had to go to a shelter at the Neil (ph.) station and sometimes I didn't get home till eight, nine o'clock in the morning. That's how long the air raid lasted. Once in a while I wo uld just make it home and immediately had to go into ou r cellar which was se t up as an air raid shelter. Q: Was the work hard? A: Yeah, well, we had to work hard. You know , dirty laundry e had somebody standing over us to see that we -- we didn't sit still. We really worked all the time. Q: I want to ask you to go back a minute because -- A: Okay. Q: -- before you had mentioned to me that as a school girl -- A: Yeah. Q: -- there was a lot of anti-semitism in the school itself. A: Yeah. Q: Can you tell me -- A: Well, I'll tell you for instan ce I had a primary teacher in my school who was a stanch in the semite (ph.) and she always preached anti-semitism. Hatred for Jews. And of co urse that dropped off on the young students who already were in th e Hitler youth and were i ndoctrinated anyway and therefore made life miserable. Q: Was she mean to you? A: She was -- no, she always made an exception of me becaus e she had known my family. One of my father's sisters had been a teacher years earlier together with her. So she was familiar with my family and she always said "Well, of course th ere are exception and Isle is one of these exceptions, but in general, all Jews are bad and all Jews are doi ng bad things," and this was the jist of her story. Q: Was that a relief to you that you were an exception? A: No, I felt terribly embarrassed by it. Especial ly there was another Jewish girl in my class who was of course was meant by all this insinua tions and it made me feel very bad. 6 Q: Is there anymore, in a detail you can give me about the persecutions or what you saw and heard in -- in -- in the atmosphere in Berlin before you were deported? A: Well, you know, in Berlin we really kept pr etty much to ourselves except, you know, getting together with our family. There r eally wasn't much contact with th e Gentile population. They were to stay from us anyhow. And well, you saw that very often even be fore the pro bone of 1938 that a Jewish source would be vandalized and Jewish hom es, you know, they were -- painted swastikas on them and, in general, these were the things that stand out in my mind. Q: Did people continue going to synagogue? A: Yes, people did go to synagogue. Q: So that wasn't totally restricted? A: No, that was one thing that wa s not restricted at the time. Q: And your father continued to work? A: Um, my father, no. My father only got permi ssion to move to Berlin under the regulation that he would not work in Be rlin. That he could not make a livi ng. Actually, we had to live on the pension and some papers, you know, treasury papers or things like that that we had. So that he could not work anymore. Q: How -- did your family ha ve friends or did they have an y sense of what was coming? A: Oh, yes. We definitely had a feeling that we wanted to get out of Germany desperately. I think I mentioned that before that we didn't have a chance to get out. Yeah, no. My mother, she was very a pestimate person, pessimistic, and then the news of the pertration (ph.) starte d to come about. She suggested that we should commit suicide togeth er because we would never survive any kind of deprecation (ph.), but I sort of talked her out of it and said "Oh, you'd be surprised. We will manage. We will live through it," and I still had hoped that it wouldn't be quite as bad as the -- as she had anticipated. So then while I was doing the fo rced labor and that laundry in January of 1942, the beginning of January, we got a notice that we would be resettled to the east. They did not mention where to, just to the east. And we were suppose to pa ck our clothing, bedding, a kerosene 7 heater, and possibly sewing machin e which I had of course and wh ich we packed, we packed all these things and never saw any of it again. Th en on January 11, 1942 the German secret police came to our house and took us away and they sealed off our apartm ent which most likely later on was plundered. They took us to a gathering place at the synagogue in Berl in where a whole group was assembled for this tr ansport which consisted of 1,037 peop le. Mostly middl e aged and older people. Very few young ones. My mother discovered one young gi rl by the name of Stella. She introduced me to her and we befr iended each other and went to th e first part of the diplocation together. Q: But did they tell you when you got there a nything more about where you were going or what was happening? A: No, they just said "To the east." We would be se nt to the east to work there. Q: Were they polite? A: Not too polite. I mea n, they just out right told us we would be resettled to work in the east. Then we stayed in that synagogue of two days. We slept on th e floor of course, being that many people. And on the 13th of Janu ary the Jewish communities made sandwiches for us to take along on the trip. And on the 13th we were put aboard an old, unheated train for our trip east. Q: What was the ge neral mood like? A: Well, we were all quite depressed of course. And on -- on this old train. Our mood became more somber and it was rea lly bad. It was so cold that even th e drinking water froze. My father was not able to take his asthma medication which had kept him asth ma free for several years before and he suffered his first asthma atta ck on the train to Lega (ph.). Then the arrived in Lega after four days on the train. We arrived at the Skiatave ( ph.) freight station outside of Lega. And we were told by the SS that there were trucks available for the transpor t to the ghetto which was seven kilometers away, but there were not enough trucks for everybody. Just for the older and infirm people and everybody people would have to walk those seven kilometers. So my father got upon the truck and my mother was first standing in line next to me and then she suddenly said "You know, your father might have di fficulty understanding orders the SS might give him," because he 8 was somewhat hard of hear ing from an accident in hi s childhood. So she left my side and got up on the truck with my father and that was the last time I ever saw my pa rents. I was barely 19 years old at the time. So the rest of the group of us marched towards the gh etto. The seven kilometers as I said. It was 40 degrees below zero. The snow was very deep and it was very difficult to march those seven kilometers. I was luck . Before we were deported a relative had given me ski boats and I was wearing these ski boats all through my time in concentration camp. Su mmer and winter. Um, so here every time, you know, somebody slowed down a little bit on the march, the SS would use their rifle butts and kick them in the rear to turn them on until we finally made it to the ghetto. Q: And when you go t to the ghetto did anyone ask "Where's my mother. Where's my grandfather?" A: Oh, absolutely. The first thing I did was frantic ally look for my parents and so did all the other people who had left parents on the truck. And the truck never arrived at the ghettos. We were told by the SS that the trucks had been taken to Dunamenda (ph.) for th e people to work at the canning factory. And, in fact, there was no such thing as Dunamend a and the trucks were taken directly into the woods which we found out only later and the people had to strip and were shoot into open mass graves. All this, of course, we fo und out later. Meanwhile, we settled down in the houses or shacks that were assigned to us becau se the ghetto was in the wo rse slum area of Lega. Lega, actually, was a beau tiful town, but this was in a very bad area and it had occupied by the Leucoline (ph.) troops. It was a Leucoline ghetto before we Germans arrived there. So -- Q: They weren't there anymore? A: No, there was nobody -- yes, th ere were some out of -- we found out, we we re told that out of 34,000 Leucoline Jews, who had lived in the Leucoline ghetto we re all murdered except for 4,000 young men who had occupations that were important to the war effo rt. And they were separated from us German Jews. They were in a Leucolin e ghetto what we called in the German ghettos, separated by wire fences. There were some gates in the fence and on week ends the Leucoline Jews men would sometimes get permission to come over to the German ghetto and visit with us. And they all told us that they had all lost their entire families. That they all had be en killed before the first German transport arrived. In fact, we were to ld that the first German transport in November of 9 1941, and when they came to the ghetto there was still -- there was still food in the -- in the houses, in the ovens and on the table. Th e sign that the previous occupants must have just le ft before. Q: But when you got there it was -- A: When we got there, no, there were several tran sports before ours. The ghetto was separated into different groups from different parts of Ge rmany and also from Austria and some from Czechoslovakia. Each had their own area in th e ghetto. And each school had their own tempt elders and the chief of labor assignm ents which were Jews that were assigned to do the selection for the outside labor detail. Q: So -- so the real gh etto was divided. There were various communities? A: Yeah, I mean, we were all together, but different -- in differen t streets. In fact , the streets were named after the area where we had come from. There was Berlina Strasu sa (ph.), Cologne (ph.) Street and all these various, you know, we gave th em the names of the people who were living there now from German. Q: Did all of the people that were in the German ghetto ge t along or that you communicated? A: Oh, yeah. Yeah. And in the beginning in the ghetto, families were still allowed to be together which was a good thing and didn't last all too long because every few w eeks there would be a selection -- oh, yeah. When we first go there I was assigned to shoveling snow in the sleet of Lega for the whole winter. That was an assignment. In the morning we would be escort ed out of the ghetto to the place of work. In th e evening we would be escorted back and always in the ghetto they had gallows set up. And we were always led by the gallows and usually there was a corpse hanging there. Being hanged because th ey had bartered for some food on the outside which was strictly forbidden. Q: I'm afraid we are goi ng to run out of the tape. A: Okay. The Leucoline Jews had pretty bad fee lings toward us German Jews of course because all their families had been murdered to make room for us. And they had lo st everybody. So -- but -- Q: Was there tension between you? 10 A: Well, I personally didn't noti ce that much tension. Maybe, in ge neral, I didn't notice it too much. Um, these work details, the outside work details, went on, you know, these work details had to do with the war effort. You know, working for the German army and the -- an d the war industry. And some assignments were reversed and others, they were always se lection. Every few weeks we would be assembled and sent either to the right side or left side. One side meant being marked for extermination. The other side meant being selected for work detail. Q: Did you know that at the time? A: No. We -- not right in the beginning and th en later on, of course, we realized what was happening every time there was a selection and we didn' t see those people anymore that had been sent to the one side. So we had a pretty good idea that they had be en sent to the woods too and -- and shot. Q: Did you think when you first got that that the ghetto had be en cleared specifically for you in therefore you wo uld be safe? A: I don't know if we re ally felt that way. It seemed that wa y, really. It seemed that way, but we were all pretty much in the same predicament. We all had to work and as long as we were able to work and be of help to the Germans we were -- we would be aloud to work. Otherwise that was the end of us. Q: Well, you were talking about -- about the selections -- A: Yeah. Q: -- that I th ink you learned -- A: Yeah, we learned pretty fast that the people who had been sent to one side would be sent to their death. That they were bei ng taken to the woods and also shoot into the open graves. Q: Tell me a little bit more about how the ghetto bureaucracy was set up and what people's responsibilities were. A: Well, like I said before, ther e was -- first of all, was the SS ghe tto comman. Then all his under links, all our guards. They selected German Jews from each school to serve as group elders or as 11 chief of labor assignments and they -- that was thei r responsibility. And that was about as far as it went. You know -- Q: Did they -- were they respected by the -- A: Oh, there was also ghetto poli ce. Some of our young Jewish me n had to man the gates that were separating the ghettos and were used as our own inte rnal police. Q: You were talking about the people who guard the camp and you say SS. A: Yeah, when I saw SS I meant the German SS as well as the Leucoline SS. And frankly the Leucoline SS were even worse then the German SS . They took -- they were real anti-semitism. They took their jobs very seriou sly and, you know, they were, besides the hangings, the regular hangings of people who had bother ed for food -- by the way, the first transports that had come into the ghetto, when they first came into the houses they found that the apartments had been pretty much plundered. They had been de stroyed. All of the valuables had been take n out. But once in awhile hidden away some place we would discover a piece of jewelr y or something and then even though we had never gotten our own clothing in th e ghetto there was a clothing depot set up that -- where we issued our clothing and these things were used to bother on the outside for food. A piece of bread or whatever we could get. Because you could not live on the food rations we got in the ghetto. We were given 200 gram s of bread a day issued once a week and ____________ potatoes and old cabbage leaves and fish heads. And once in a great while a small portion of horse meat which was a great treat. So as I said, you had to supplement your food through outside bartering. Otherwise you could not exist. So you had to take your chances of being hanged. Sometimes one of our SS commendans wo uld shoot people on the spot besides the hangings. So we had shootings and hangings all the time. Q: Who were you bartering with? A: With the Leucoline Gentiles that we met on the outside. You know, when our guards weren't looking or so. And they knew all ready. They would see us day afte r day and they would know that we had something to give them and they brought us some bread or something edible. 12 Q: Did you ever talk to someone on what was going on when they -- A: No, we couldn't real ly. First of all, we di dn't know the Leucoline langu age. See, and in that respect, the Leucoline Jews, the few surviving Leuc oline Jews were better of f. They knew -- knew the language and also some of th em escaped from the ghetto and join ed the Protestants because they were able to speak the language and they could go in the country side and meet farmers and some of them got away with it. And later on we found out that they were working with the Protestants. Q: But none of yo u were able to? A: No, not really. One of the Leucoline fellows once suggested I should -- he would escape and I should come with him. And I said it would be out of the qu estion because we would certainly be found out because I don't speak the language. So I turned that offer down. Q: Where did you live in the ghetto? A: Well, at first, as I said, we lived with the group that we had come with from Berlin in these houses. Some houses were literally like three story buildings. Others were just shacks, but all of them had outhouses. You know, they had no toilets inside. So -- well, life was still bearable because as I said, families were still together except for those who had been singled out and -- during the selections. This came la ter on that the families were separated. In the summer of 1942, that was the first summer there, there was anot her selection and 50 young girls including my girlfriend Stella who I met in Berlin, we were selected for a work detail at the Baltic (ph.) seashore. This was the best assignment ever . We had to fix up formally Je wish homes, Nazi confiscated estates that were suppose to be made ready for recreation pl aces for high SS officials and high German officials to come there for the -- during th e summer for their recreat ion. We were housed in the, what formally must have be en servants quarters and we had no water -- unfortunately we had no water. We couldn't was ourselves or bath. So at night after dark the SS would take us to the Baltic sea to wash ourselves. We got our food from a soup kettle. Thia was the most obstrensed (ph.) soup than the food we had ha d in the ghetto, so we could easily survive on that. We got bread. One man had been taken along from the ghetto beside s us 50 girls who operated the soup kettles. So then we girls also cleaned the homes for the occupants. I, myse lf, had the gardening detail. So 13 as I said, this was a very good assignment. You know, we weren't beaten. We weren't arrested much. Yes, we were under obse rvation of the S, but they pr etty much left us alone. Q: How were you chosen for this? A: Well, the comman dant must have looked over us young girls and who ever suited his fancy he thought we would do for that assign ment. So I befriended five of the girls on this labor detail and we decided that once we would get back to the ghetto we would try to m ove together. Where as, you know, they all had been from different districts in Germany an d we had all lived in different places. So after the summ er was over we got back to the ghetto and our life went on as usual in the ghetto. We went on our work assignments and as us ual. Then in -- yeah. Q: What other work assignments now? A: Well, you know something. It's really not clear in my mind anym ore. It all had to do with the army, with the, you know, fixing up uniforms for the army and ship ments, doing shipping and pretty -- some work was very hard and we were very much abused by our captures. Others were not quite as difficult. You know, they were a little more lenient and so that was a little easier to handle. But all this time our life was in constant danger. Fi rst of all because of the bartering and a chance of being hanged or shot. And secondly, because of the constant selections. We were afraid to get sick, of course. Which happened to me and -- in the ea rly fall of 1943 I got very sick. I got jaundice and hepatitis. And I was put into the ghetto hospital which was set up instead by a German inmate doctors and nurses who were in the ghetto with us . There weren't many medications available for us, but over some weeks I got better. Never really regained my strength, but they discharged me after several weeks. But I was too week to go on outside assignments, so I -- oh, by this I forgot to mention. When we had gotten back , the six girls from the -- from the work commander at the Baltic sea, we did move together into a very old shack at the end of the ghetto that had been unoccupied. So we were under the jurisdiction of the Colon group. So now, when I wasn't ab le to out on outside work detail I talked to the chief of the labor assignment and told him of my predicament and he said "Oh, I tell you what. You can help my older daughter Lilly who has to take care old my six young children because my wife goes outside to work to bring in some food for the family." Well, this for 14 me was great. I enjoyed being wi th the children. I enjoyed being with a family b ecause I hadn't had a family in all this time. I lived with my frie nds there in the, you k now, in the shack, but the daytime I spent with my friends there. Q: This just brings up a question before you were gone. There were a lot of children in this ghetto? A: Yes, at that time there still were a lot of children until later. Q: Were there activ ities for the kids? A: Yes, they did have activities for the children. I'm really not too clear on that. I think they did have some schooling and some pl ay groups, you know, where olde r youngsters took care of the young children. A nd I'm really not too clea r anymore, but there were some activities for the children. Q: Were there activities for the rest of the people? Were there vocational courses or was there religious activities? Wa s there any culture? A: Well, any religious activities w ould have to be held in the various apartments. You know, there was no -- no synagogue -- nothing of that kind and th ey were held in secret. Services were held, you know, there were some Orthodox Jews there who held services in their apartment and invited some other Orthodox people to participate in them. I understand that there once in awhile was a concert. You know, I was neve r part of it and I really wa sn't personally there. But I've heard that once in awhile there were so me performances. You kn ow, some of our ghetto inmates still had some, I don't know how they managed to get instruments unless they found them in -- when they got to the ghetto. Yo u know, left behind by the Laclians. It's quite possible because everything had been ta ken away from us. You kn ow, any kind of jewelry had been taken away from us. Also , fur coats. Everythi ng, you know, and that was all sent back to Germany for, you know, for use th ere. And, you know, as I said, e never saw any of our own clothing anymore. Only, yo u know, if it happened to be in the clothing depot. Q: So what -- after you came home from work in the evening what did you do? A: Well, we had -- Q: I'm sorry. One second. 15 A: Well, in the evenings of co urse we cooked our meals from th e meager rations that we had and sat around the dinner table and had conversations. We had found some books in the apartments from the Leucoline Jews we were reading. But we went to bed pretty early because we worked very hard and we were very tired. Q: Do you remember any of thos e conversations and the types of things you would talk about? A: Well, actually, we reminis ced more about our childhood and about the good times than we wanted to dwell on the hard times that we had there. Which actually became worse later on. Well, anyway, while I was helping my frie nd Lilly to take care of these younger children I had a relapse of my hepatitis and the jaundice and I was taken back to the hospital. This was in the later fall of 1946. And I was in the hospital ag ain for several weeks and improved to some extent, but really not enough to be discharged. So one day my girlfriend Lilly who ha d visited me regularly at the hospital, came by ____________. There was no visiting time and she called me at the window and said to me "I'm very glad to hear that you're comi ng out of the hospital tomorrow." Well, I understood immediately what that message meant and I told the doctor, the chief doctor in the hospital, that I would be leaving the hospital the ne xt day and he said "Not with my permission. You are in no condition to be released from the hospital." I said "With or without your permission I'm leaving." And so here I was barely able to sta nd on my feet, but I left th e hospital the next day. It so happened that Lilly's father, the chief of la bor details, had gotten wind of the fact that there would be a -- that the hospital would be evacuated. All these people would be sent away to their deaths and that's why he had told his daughter to warn me of that. So I came out. This was in November of '43. I came out of the hospital and sure enough a few days later the hospital population was taken out and put to death, but all the other ghetto inma tes had to stand for selection. And this time not only were the infirm people taken away, all the older ones who were left and there were not many of them, but mothers with young children. All young children were put to one side and we were asked at what plac es we had worked. And I of co urse have not -- having not had worked on the outside, li ed that I had been working at the Av iar (ph.) which was the army clothing depot. Otherwise, it would have meant death for me too. And luckily I got away with it. I was put 16 -- put on the right side. So all these mothers with the young children got taken away that time to their death. Q: When you say that the hospital was evacuated -- A: Yeah, well -- Q: -- did you know where these people were -- I mean, what happ ened? How did you know what was going on? A: Well, we had a pretty fairly good idea that it didn't mean anything good. That they were meant for death because, you know, there were previous sel ections in the ghetto. So we had a fairly good idea and my girlfriend Lilly actua lly saved my life by getting me out there in time. Otherwise, I certainly wouldn't be around anymor e. So now, this meant, this was November '43, that meant the end of the Steliga (ph.) ghetto. All the ghetto inmates that were left were sent to concentration camp, Kisavold (ph.), outside of Le ga. And some of them stayed ther e for work details there. Most of us were sent to outside installations wh ere we were housed at our work places. So I was sent to this Av iar (ph.), to the ar my clothing depot where we we re housed in barracks that had double or triple bunks where we slept and we were given a me sket (ph.) and a canteen and we worked there taking care of the cl othing for the army. Sorting it. Shipping it out and all these things connected with it. Q: How many of you were there? A: You know, I don't really recall. There were quite a few of us. Maybe a 100 . I'm really not sure. Q: You weren't in Camp Ki sserwal (ph.) were you? A: No, I was lucky. We were only processed in Camp Kisser wal. Now, all these outside installations were under the jurisdiction of Camp Kisserwal. So the -- the food there, again, we got soup that was made with potato peel s and we got some bread. It was sufficient, but just barely so. That we could just live on it and do our work. Q: Were you with the other girlfriend that yo u had been living with? Did they make it? A: No. In this particular work detail I was not with any of my fr iends. These were all other whom I met in the ghetto, but nobody that I was re ally friends with. 17 Q: Were you pretty stro ng or did you feel -- A: Well, I really wasn't strong yet because I hadn't fully recovered from the -- from the jaundice and the hepatitis, so I was quite week yet. But I mustered all my strength and did my work. Then, this was from November '43. July of '44 we were still working there. Even other people had other work, outside detail work details, but all having to do with the army. In Ju ly of '44 a delegation came from Camp Kisserwa l and Viverman (ph.) had our hair ___ _________ off. So now we were all bald and we were given prison clothing. Then in August we were suddenly a ssembled and taken away from our work places and we were put on freighters of barg ers (ph.) you might call them. Open bargers. Pressed in like sardines. You know , that how many of us were there and we were being shipped out again. The conditions on these bargers were te rrible. I mean, we were just laying one on top of another. We bare ly had a little water to drink and it was just horrible conditions. Now, on the barge I was very lu cky. All of a sudden I found my girlfriend Lilly and two other friends from the ghetto, Margaret (ph.) and Gerta who were sister s and who were there with their mother. And all of a sudden the four -- the five of us, actua lly, with the mother, were together and from that moment on the five of us were together until our liberation actually. So we were happy to have found each other on the bargers. The trip on the barger took three days and took us to the port of Dansic (ph.) or ____________ as it was called in Polish. And we were shipped to Camp Stitof (ph.). Now, Stitof -- Q: How much information -- di d you know where you were going or why you were going? A: No, we had no idea. They just put us on the freighter and -- Q: Had you at this point had any information about the war? Did you have a sense of what was going on? A: Well, somehow we sensed that the -- the war was not going to we ll for the Germans. That's why they kept shipping us from place to place and that the Russians must have be en coming closer. We sensed that. We didn't really k now for sure, but we sensed that. So when we sa w Stitof, it was a horrible sight. 18 You know, the chimneys were smoking and the sme ll was like stuck yards. And we immediately thought that if we had to stay there we would never make it out alive. So -- Q: What did you see when you went in ____________ together, people in there? A: Well, we saw other people behind -- there were di fferent sections in Stito f. They had different areas all separated by barbed wire where different people from ot her camps, I guess, had been assembled. And luckily we were kept together in one area behind barbed wire. And we didn't stay there long. I think we were there only maybe a week. Not even a week, so we were very lucky. Q: So you weren't wo rking or anything? A: Not at Stitof. We we re sent away to work details. So luckily my four girlfriends and the mother and I were selected together. We were all togeth er a group of 1, 000 women who were sent to the Polish country side which had been taken over by the Germans to dig tr enches for the German army. Q: We stopped when you had ride from Stotif to the ____________ side, but I wanted to ask you to go back a little bit more to the Raga (ph.) ghetto and maybe tell me a little bit more about the lifestyl e in there and whether you had social life, whether you worked everyday, whether you celebrated holidays. A: Yes, first of all, a lot of the Jewish girl s befriended the Leucoline Jews who came over on the weekend to be with -- with us girls. And as a matter of fact some -- some of them later on after the liberation married them because, I mean, most of these fellows had been previously married and had lost their family. But we had -- there also were, of course, boyfriends, girlfriends in the German ghetto, you know, that we re together and on weekends we enjoyed each others company and the Leucoline fellows would come over and we would socialize togeth er. We would get together in groups of two couples, three coupl es in somebody's apartment we would get together. And, in general, enjoy each others company and enjoy the day of f from work. Q: Oh, you had a day off. 19 A: Well, yes. We had a day off from work. That's on the weeken ds when the Leucoline Jews also had their day -- day off from work. Q: So that you had the freedom to go back and forth between the Leucoline ____________ when the German ____________. A: No. We German Jews were not allowed to go to the Leucoline ghettos and I think the Leucoline fellows had to get special permission to come over to visit in the German ghettos. Which they got quite readily. Q: Did the Leucoline Jews get any kind of favor ite treatment in terms of work assignments or freedom? A: Well, I believe that their wo rk assignments were better because they had special skills that were needed for the war effort. Tool makers and whatever other tools th ey had that came in handy for the war effort and for that reason I be lieve that they had preferred treat ment at work. Whereas we just were assigned, you know, general labor. Q: What were the diffe rences between the way men and women we re treated. How did you feel as a women? A: No, lots of time we women were treated just as rough as the men. Of course, well, some of them might have treated some of the young girls a little bit better, maybe, than they would have men or older women. Which applies also to the SS. Y ou know, some of the Germ an SS sort of favored some of the German girls an d saw to it that they had better work assignments. Q: Were there girls that you knew wh o would take great advantage of that? A: Well, I personally didn 't have that experience. I mean, my girlfriend Lilly and Margaret and Gerta and myself, we didn't have that experience. My friend Stella who I had met in Berlin on the transport befriended a Leucoline Jew and later on af ter the liberation she married him. But, in general, you know, we girls we re together and socialized. Q: And those relationships would be under girls that were im portant to you? A: Oh, very important. Very important because you could always rely on th em to help you in any situation. 20 Q: What about -- you mentioned that people might be able to pray in pr ivate at home, what about when Jewish holidays aros e? Were you aware? A: Well, we Orthodox Jews, of course, tried to observe the Jewish holidays. In fact, the Youngkiper (ph.) which wasn't diff icult anyhow because we didn't ge t much to eat in any case. I remember on Passover people trie d to barter for flour instead of bread. And Lilly's mother, for instance, was able to bring some flour into the ghet to and while we of cour se never given any matza by the Natzis, we managed to bake matza ourselves . Lilly and I for instan ce, through her father who had talked to some Leucoline Jews and knew that they had some ovens available in the Leucoline ghetto. We sneaked over in the middle of the night with our flour and we baked matza for ____________. And so her father conducted the seta (ph.) as much as you could. You might even have had hagolta (ph.) whic h you might have found in the Leucoline ghetto. Q: Was that risky fo r you to do that? A: Oh, absolutely. We risked our lives by doing it, but then you risk your life everyday. Even bartering for food or anything like that. So that was nothing un usual. You know, we forget everyday could be our last day and we tried not to dwell on that. We dw elled on the past and on better life and were hoping that we mi ght survive and have a better future. Q: Didn't that give you a sense of excitement or pride or something __ __________ ____________? A: Yes, it made us happy and pr oud that we were able to observe a Jewish holiday and even with matza. Q: In a way that's a form of religion? A: Oh, absolutely. Try to resist. I mean, there was not much resistance that we could matza in our condition. Q: Do you remember the ____________ in general? A: Oh, yeah. We were there fo r quite some time. No, really nothing too much that I can add to that. 21 Q: And I want you to pick up now -- A: Where we had left off? Q: -- you had been in Stitof about a week. A: Yeah. Q: And you were housed -- A: Well, there were house and ba rrack there behind barbed wire an d we were assembled. Like I said, a 1,000 women were picked out for this work detail. Not all of us were from the German ghettos. We had Jewish women th ere from Laclia, from Lithoania and Istonia (ph.). All the three different countries. All the countries. So here we were in the Polish country side assigned to digging the trenches. We were hous ed in a wooden tent with high -- te nts. Like circle tents. Round wooden ply wood tent s. 100 women to each tent in two laye rs. One layer of st raw on the ground, a plank, a wooden plank, and another la yer of straw for the second layer. 50 on the bottom and 50 on the top. We were each given a horse blanket. That's th e only way that you can call it and, of course, there was no light, no heat . Nothing. In the begi nning it was summer. We wo uld dig our ditches and we would all, in the morning, we woul d first shovel a seat for Margaret and Gerta's moth er so that she could sit down in the green and we warned her when the gaurds were co ming closer to look busy and shovel the earth. We -- we girls would work harder to make up for her part of the work and we really dug these drenches which be came very difficult in the winter because we first had to loosen the ice and snow with pick axes before we even get -- could get at the earth. We also built barbed -- barriors across the road that were suppose to stop the Russian army from advancing. Now, in our tents here in this place we were, also we were gi ven very meger rations. We got the soup each day that was made out of potato peel s and ___________ _ and cabbage leaves and things like that, and really unsufficient for the work ew were doing. So at night, in the dark, we young girls, two at a time, we were four, we would sneak out into the fe ilds and steal turnips and potatos. The turnips we would eat raw and the potatos of course you couldn' t eat raw so we once in awhile -- while were able to make a fire and bake some poatos in the fire. We had, occassionally we had SS guards who 22 were a little more leaniant and who looked the other way and let us get away with that. So that was a special treat when we had baked potatoes. In th e -- in the tents we -- we were infected with lice and there were mice or rats rus tling around under the straw and we'd never forget any of them because as soon as -- as it got light they got away and so we lived with this . People got sick. There were so many that died. That I think at the end of this work de tail out of 1,000 women maybe there were 100 left. Not more than that . ____________ for it and dysentery and they just died off. I got sick too. I had -- I had intestin al problems too. My legs were co vered with open boils that were oozing puss. And I felt pretty ba d, but we got through this and th e mother of Margaret and Gerta got through with it. And this lasted from August of '44 till January of '45. Q: Had, in this period of time, did you learn anymore about wh at was going on in the outside world? A: Yes, we had heard that the war was not goin g well for the Germans and that the Russians were coming close. So in Ja nuary of 19 -- of 1945 a ll of a sudden we were asse mbled and we started on a death march. The SS wanted to get us closer back to Germany towards Germany. So here we marched. Had we stayed in Lega originally we understand that Lega was liberated in '44 already and I think in October of '44, so many more of us would have stayed alive, but the Nazis always took us a step further closer towards Germany an d here we were on this death march and marching day and night and all of us were really sick. My girlfriend Margaret was de sperately ill at the time. And, you know, I also had diar ea and things like that. And whoever wasn't able to march any further and fell by th e bay side would get shot by the SS accompanying us in _ ___________. So we marched through several ni ghts, but then one night the SS finally let us stay over night in a ba rn. In an empty ba rn. And when we woke up the next morning, I believe it was January 21st of 1945, our SS guards were gone and we were suddenly fee or so we thought, but our joys were short li ved. We moved on by the time -- there were just the five of us together. Maybe a few other wome n were with us at first, but eventually there were just the five of us. We went on because in the barn there was nothing to eat for us. We looked an d found another deserted farm h ouse where we moved in. And 23 the first thing was to kill the chickens and made chicken soup and gave it to our friend Margaret who I'm sure would not have surviv ed another week of marching. Sh e was that ill at the time. And she ate the chicken soup and then we found some canned cherries in the cellar of the farm house and she ate a whole jar of the sour cherries and that re ally cleaned her out. And from that day on she started to get better. Now, two days after the SS had left the Russian soldie rs started to march in, but they never really liberated us. We were just a hand ful of women and we to ld him that we were Jewish and had come from concen tration camp and they wouldn't be lieve us. They kept saying "Nancy," and we were saying "Y es, ____________. " Which means I'm Jewi sh. But they didn't believe us. They thought we were Gentiles and Nazis ____________ and so they were after us. And also -- they were after us, yeah, the soldiers were after us young girls. They were always trying to rape us and we somehow manage d to evade them all the time. All four of us managed to get away without being raped, but it was difficult. We were -- Q: ____________ ____________. A: We were hiding under the beds, in the cellar. When we saw them coming we would, on the way, hide outside in the barn ya rd some place. And th e mother would protec t the ____________. She would try -- try to talk to them. We learne d a few word of Russian which I have long since forgotten, but it didn' t help us really. Q: It must have been frighten ing for ____________ with the Nazis to be liberated and still be fighting for your life. A: Yeah, see we never had any -- we never got any papers because nobody really liberated us. It was plain Russian soldiers who marched in. Who had no authority to give us any papers or who didn't even believe that we were Jews. So we we re suppose to go to a town called ____________ in Polish where they ha d the Russian war commander. And the Russian war commandant was suppose to give us instructions what to do further. Now, we had heard since there were women from the Baltic sea among us th at women from th e eastern state would be sent home because the war there us over alre ady, but the German Jews would be shipped off to Siberia because they didn't really the German Jews and, you know, these soldie rs must have notified the Russian authorities, so 24 they were constantly after us. And, so we tried desperately to avoid the soldiers ____________ of Nunmark (ph.). And we marched around the Polis h country side looking for one shelter after another and the farmers woul d sometimes put us up, gi ve us shelter in their attic and we would work or them. I did some sewing for them. My gi rlfriend Gerta mending socks for them. The others worked in the fields sometimes a nd so we found one place after the other. Sometimes we slept in a church and this went on for five months. Five months we struggled thr ough this and meanwhile, you know, I always thought coming back to the rapes, attempted rapes, I thought the soldiers would leave me alone because if they would see my legs with all the puss running out of the sores that they wouldn't be interested in me, but that never w ould have stopped them. The only reason we ____________ ourself was, you know, being -- hiding away or some other way, but that would have never stopped them. Q: Were there any women soldiers or Jewish soldiers around? A: Occasionally we had a Jewish mentor, but we never say a women soldier, but we had, once in awhile we had a Jewish soldier who, of course, told the others to leave us alone. And that also saved us. So, you know, after th ese five months, practically fi ve months, of wandering around Poland sometimes we would be given, you kn ow, ____________ ____________ they had school lunches and they would give us some milk and potatoes to eat. You know, and other times the farmers would give us food for wo rk that we did for th em. So by this time we not only had the Russian authorities after us, but we also had the Polish militia (ph.) who was looking for us too. And, you know, the Polish, they are the greatest anti-semitist. They are known for that. So by this time we already figured it di dn't make any difference anymore who would catch us. The Russians or the Poles, we had to take a chance and go to ____________. So we did that. Came to __________ __ and we were lucky. The day we arrived there the Russian war commidant was not there and his under link di d not know the procedure. Did not know that they should, the Germans, were being moved to Siberi a and didn't know what to do w ith us, so he told us to go to ____________. In ____________ we would find the Red Cross. Now, ea rlier on our friend Lilly 25 had found a few small pieces of gold on our deat h march which was also, you know, the road was also being used by Nazis who were fleeing when the Russians came closer. So somebody must have lost these pieces of gold and my girlfriend re ally found them. We gave a piece of gold to for our trip to ____________. We got on a freight train and that train never stopped at the station in ____________. It only slowed dow n, so we had to jump off the moving train. We girls helped one another and then we helped the mo ther off the train and we made our way to the Red Cross. Q: This was when? A: This was in June of 1945. And the Red Cross put us up. Took care of us for awhile and the mother by this time had a very bad cold and was really sick, but we didn't realize how serious it really was. So after we had stay ed there for awhile we also went to the si de of the ____________ ghettos which had been demolished by then and afte r awhile we decided it was time to move on and we wanted to try to get back to Germany. So with another piece of gold from Lilly we got on a train to Berlin and in Berlin we were some of the first refugees coming back and they had just set up a Jewish relief center. And that was opposite the Jewish hospital. And Margaret and Gerta's mother was immediately hospitalized. She had ____________ and even though she got good treatment there she died on us in Berlin. Which was very sad because after all she had gone through, three years of concentration camp, five months of wandering throu gh Poland, she made it all the way to Berlin and then past away. And th e hospital and the relief center were located in the British sector of Berlin. We met some British soldiers and they gave us money to bury the mother. I knew the large Jewish cemetery there and th at's where we buried her. So me anwhile, we had stayed at the relief center across from the hospita l and because they had just been set up they had nothing really to give us. They had no clothing to give us, so they gave us some blue, white checkered blanket covers from the hospital. Out of which they had sewing machines there. Out of which I sewed dresses for us four girls and these dresses were -- were all the ____________ in Berlin were our first clothing. Then after the mother had died some of theses British soldiers found us an -- a nice house in Berlin. There must have been Nazis living there who had fled and well, we made ourselves at home there. We took some of the clothing ther e. Then I found my Uncle in Berlin, in a suburb of 26 Berlin and he told me he wanted me to stay in Berlin wherea s I had intended to go with my girlfriend to Levitt (ph.), but he convinced me that it would be better for me to stay in Berlin since I was entitled to food ra tion in the Soviet after the war. And my other benefits we re two days where I had ____________. So he rented me a furnished room and the girls tried to get back to their homes in the west. On a British truck, you know, British army. But the first ti me they couldn't make it. They got stopped by the Russians at the boarder and were sent back. So all of a sudden they appeared in my furnished room, my furnished room again and we spent two more days together and then they made a second attempt. This time the British soldiers hid them among barracks on the trucks and they made it to the west. They made it to Margaret and Gerta' s house which was still found intact in their home town. And our friend Lilly stayed with them. So we were always in contact with one another. I had to find myself a job. I had to earn a livin g and I absolutely did not want to work for any Germans. I figured they were all Nazis and I'm certainly not going to work for them. And I managed to find myself a job with the American army that was sta tioned in the suburb of Berlin where I had my furnished home. I go t a job there in the office. That was the quarter master's supply people where all the American tro ops were supplied that were sta tioned all around Be rlin. And I was in charge of the supply. Q: ____________. A: Okay. Q: You had gotten a job in Berl in with the American army. A: Right. Yeah. At this army base I was the on ly Jewish girl. All the other girls were Nazi girls who had befriended American soldiers and wh o got them into this job. So -- Q: What did that seem like? A: It didn't make me feel very good, but that's the way it was a nd I found there wa s one Jewish man at the base who was play ing the accordion and the pi ano for the soldiers. A nd he came over to me one day and said "Are you the Jewish girl that just returned from concentration camp. It's the talk of the town that there's a Jewish girl." I said, "That's me. I'm the one ." He said "You know, we have 27 quite a few Jewish soldiers. I'll in troduce you." So he did. He intro duced me to the Jewish soldiers who were really wonderful. I mea n, here the soldiers were not supp ose to give us anything. You know, us employees at the base, but they always managed to give us, you know, instant coffee and soda and cigarettes. And, you know, it was very good because, I mean, all the supplies in Berlin were very short ____________ ration. But I could eat at the army base, but ____________. Now, the Jewish soldiers had services Friday night at th e temple. They took me along for the service. They had asked me if I wanted to go and I said ab solutely. I would like to attend a service. And every Friday night they would take me in thei r army vehicle a nd take me to the ____________ where we had a Jewish service. After the services there was a Je wish family in Berlin who had lived under ground, meaning they had been hidden by German gentiles all during the war and who had come back to their home which had not been destroyed, wh ich, by the way, I found out that the house that my parents and I had li ved in was bombed to the ground. Y ou know, when I came back I saw it bombed to the ground whic h made me very happy. But not the anti-______ ______. That was never ____________. Anyway, we came to this open house and they always invited all the ____________, you know, refugees or people who had lived under gr ound and had very interesting discussions group and socializing at their house every Friday night. Which made it very pleasant, you know, very nice escape. Then in -- when was it -- in April of 1946, you know, me and my other fellows were working at the -- Q: Where were you living at this point? A: I had a furnished room. Q: You were basically alone. A: Yes, I was basically alone. I had a furnished room not too far from the army base. Q: Did you -- were -- di d you have any family? A: No, none, I mean, at that time only later on di d I get in contact with my Uncle. Besides from this Uncle in the Gentile and -- and their family. I really didn't have anybody there. I befriended the Jewish family who really took in like I was their own child. That was also a mixed marriage, but 28 they had suffered persecution. The Gentile husband had been taken to a concentration camp for awhile. So they treated me very well and tr eated me like family. Q: What about your relations with the German people in Berlin ? What kind of response? A: Well, of course, none of them ever admitted that they ever had been Nazis. Of course, there were no more Nazis around, you know . As far as that was concerne d they all lied, but, of course, every -- every person at the age they could have b een Nazis. You know, I'm sure they were Nazis before and aside from some of th e girls that I worked with at th e base I really didn't have much contact. As I said, all my spare time I spent with this one Jewish family that had befriended me. So one Friday night in April of 1946, this Jewish family told us that they had obtained questionnaires from the American Joint Distributio n Committee to apply for visas to go to the Unites States for us -- for us, mostly girls who had returned and some fellows too. Some fellows who re gularly attended these open houses. And I, even though I was not that anxious to go to America because I had nobody there, but I knew I couldn't get to Palestine (ph.) at that time, so I fille d out the form to apply for a visa. And to my greatest surprise, several weeks later I was called to the American consulate and they questioned -- in fact, I had gotten -- I had just arrived at my office at the army base. I had not even had my br eakfast yet when I received a telegram from the Joint Distribution Committee telling me to come to the consulate. So I immediately went to the consulate and I was questioned there the whole day. Making sure I was r eally the person I claimed to be. I had by this time, I can show it to you later, I had a little thing like a passport stating I was a victim of fasisim (ph.) and at the end of the day they finally believed me and it didn't take that much lo nger then I got my visa. Through the generosity of President Truman who had allocat ed visas for this place person. From -- it was a complete supply and several weeks later there in May of 1 945 -- '46 excuse me. I was sent to Bromine (ph.) to the port of Bromine on my way to Amer ica. So I first notified my friends that I was coming to Br omine and all three of them, Marg aret, Gerta and Lilly came to Bromine We were housed there in the British ca mps they had set up and we were housed there four weeks before we left on a sh ip. And my girlfriends spent the whole week with me there which was absolutely wonderful. We ha d a great time together. And they saw me off. On the 14th of 29 May 1946 we were put aboard a liberty ship. It was, you know, a former American troop transport, the marine perch. And we were put aboard the ship on our trip to America. Now, it was quite primitive of course. Being an army ship we had triple -- triple bunks, but I really spend no time in the bunk at all. I spent the whole time up on deck because dow n below you would only get sea sick because everybody there got sea sick, so I stayed on top and our whole group had a wonderful time. We were on the ship for 10 days and we were supp lied there by the sailors with fresh food which to us was a real novelty and I was ne ver sea sick, so I could enjoy all the good foods that they offered me and had really a great time. Q: Did you know -- did you have any frie nds on this boat before you -- A: No, none of my friends -- we ll, not really. They were mostly not from my camp. There were different people who had just come back to Berli n, but no, I don't recall that I met anybody from my camp. Q: Weren't you a little nerv ous about taking this large trip all by yourself? A: Oh, certainly. Oh, certainly. And I had nobody in -- in America. It was a big undertaking -- taking, but I certainly wasn't going to stay in Germany. That I couldn't do. I couldn't stay there. So we all wanted to get out. My friends wanted to ge t out. So when we spot ted the Statue of Liberty as we were close to New York that was the biggest thrill of my life. So we landed in New York and the Joint Distribution committee was there to greet us and they put us up in a hotel and they took care of us. And what they had in mind was they were going to send, there were quite a few young girls among us and they had in mind to send us young girls out of New York because they figured we wouldn't be able to get j obs in New York and even, you co uld even get housing or even a furnished room was difficult to come by. It was shortly after the wa r when all the soldiers had come back, so they tried to place the young girls with Jewish families all over th e country. You know, to be baby sitters, household help to Jewish families and for some r eason I was absolutely determined to stay in New York. I don't -- I don't really kn ow why. I had nobody ther e. The only thing I had was my -- my Jewish soldie rs from my army base in Berlin had given me addresses of their families in New York whom I contacted a nd this somehow made me feel I wanted to stay here and even 30 though the Jewish committee told me I probably wouldn't be able to find a job in New York and I wouldn't find accommodations in New York I managed through thes e contacts to find myself a furnished room. I also found a job as a seamstress and so then I was on my own. You know, I -- I moved into the furnished room and I started a life on my own being a steam stress. Now, in the meantime, my health, of course , had been permanently impair ed through all the years of concentration camp and wandering around in Poland and I had this serious intestinal problem. Always pain and diareah and so, which was later on diagnosed as __ __________. So that made it very difficult. I mean , I went to work as a seamstress. I went to work everyday. I didn't even miss work even when I was running a fever, I went to work. And this went on -- meanwhile, my girlfriends Margaret and Gerta were still at their home in the west. My girlfriend Lilly had found two of her brothers, two older brothers were aliv e and she found them back in Colon and they had gone to an Uncle in France and they were living in France at that time. Now, um -- I'm stuck. I had -- yeah, so a year after I had gotten to America, in fact, in June of 1947 I met my future husband at the swimming pool. I forgot to mention, my friends Margaret and Gerta came to America a year after me. They had an Uncle in Chicago and they settled in Ch icago. So meanwhile, I met my husband into the end of June of 1947 and three months later we got married because he had had similar experiences that I had except that he had come to Amer ica just before the war, but he us never able to get his parents out and his parents and younger sister were also killed in concentration camp. So for our wedding in Oc tober, my girlfriends Margaret and Gerta came to celebrate our wedding even though they were here only such a short time and had just started jobs. But they managed to come here a nd it was really wonderful. So, I mean, we were ab le to find, my husband and I got a basement apartm ent. You know, apartments we re very hard to come by and started a new life. I continued on sewing. You know, working as a seamstress. He had come back from -- from the service. He was in the American army and he was working in the post office, so we got settled in for a new life. And the only draw back was that I was sick so much. Th en in 1949 our son was born and after that my ____________ really got bad. Even worse than before and while he was quite young yet I was in and out of hospitals and that ma de it, of course, quite difficult 31 for my husband. He had to go to work and had to take care of the child after wo rk. He got some from cousins and from friends who he lped out, but in general, it was quite difficult. But all in all, we had a good life. And so, yo u know, we can't complain. We're very happy that we ar e here in this country and were able to start all over again. And in the mean time then just abou t three years ago to ad to my other aliments I got a very sever case of shingles in my head and my eye and because of my impaired immune syst em through all the years of concentration camp I could neve r get over it. I had -- I suffered a severely damaged nerve that leaves me in constant pain and, but you have to put up with it. You know, life goes on. We have a very close relationship. We have a 16 year old gr anddaughter and we have a very close relationship with our family and so life is good. Q: I'm going to ask you a few more questions. A: Can you turn on the ai r conditioner or something? Q: Do you want to take a break for a couple minutes? Okay. We'l l have a couple of photographs. A: Yeah. Q: Did you think that you would survive all of this? A: Well, I tell you, we were hopi ng. We didn't think with a clear mind. We were hoping we would survive. In fact, when we were in these wooden tents doing our last work detail in Poland, at night, you know, we -- there was no light in the tent or anything, we would lay down and we would reminisce and make believe we were in our cozy living rooms at home and the mother of Margaret and Gerta would ____________ us th e story of her news and how she had spent time at the English finishing school, so we kept ourselves alive. In fact, when we were diggi ng the trenches we were standing on top of a mountain wh ere we dug the trench we would si ng. So we would always try to look on the bright side and hope we woul d survive it. Never really believing it. Q: What do you think ga ve you the strength? I m ean, you were a young girl . You were all alone. A: Yeah, well -- Q: What do you think got you through this? 32 A: I don't know. I just had the will to live. It's as simple as that. So after my husband and I were married already as I said, my girlfriends Margar et and Gerta lived in Germany in west Germany until they came to the states. Our girlfriend Lill y immigrated from France to Pa lestine. That wasn't quite Australia and she met a young man that became a doctor and who is a professor in medical research and they still live in Israel. And we four girls have kept in contact steadily over all these more than 50 years. We telephone each other. We get together once in aw hile. Even when Lilly from Israel has been here on any -- any number of times an d then we try to all four get together and reminisce about the old times and th ink how good we have it now in co ntrast. So the friendship has gone on between our families now for all these years. Q: You guys have quite a bond. A: Yes, quite a bond. We are very close. Q: Were -- were there other people who, I guess, didn't survive by helping each other and who were -- I mean, -- well, I guess what I'm asking is was there a di fferent sense of morality at that time being that people were strugg ling so hard to survive? A: Yes. Yes. I mean, you fought for every piece of bread, for every, you know. And it made it very hard. You know, people did fight with eac h other and which we ne ver did. You know, we always -- she had every bit that we had and that saved us because I' m sure none of us would be alive today if we had not had this clos e bond and -- and did everything together and shared everything. All our experiences. All our food. Everything. Q: How important was religion to you through out all of this? A: Well, I still believed in God even though it was very difficult under the circumstances to believe that there was a god. That he let us go through a ll these hard times, but I guess men -- I guess it was meant to be. So, I mean, I looked at it that way. Q: Did you pray? A: Yes, I prayed that we would some day be freed. We would some day be able to go back to a normal life. Q: You never resented the ____________. 33 A: No. Q: Or though about -- A: No. No, never -- never did. Q: It's still important. A: It's still very important and it's very important to my granddaughter especially. She is very aware of the Jewish ____________ synagogue. You know, they don't keep a koshe r house, but she goes to synagogue regularly. And is involved with Jewish youth groups. Go away together on weekends some times with Jewish youth groups and she says she will only marry a Jewish fellow. She wants to go to a college where there are a lot of Jewish fellows. Q: Did you think that America was any differ ent for you being a young women and getting through all of this? A: Oh, definitely. You know, an older person certainly wouldn't have had the strength to survive all these hardships and all these illnesses. Q: But what about bei ng a women versus a man. Did you survive differently? In terms of relationship. In terms of -- A: I don't -- I wouldn't -- couldn't really tell. I'm really not aware of it. Q: Was it difficult to begin again? Either -- A: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. It was difficult. We had nothing, you know. We came back to Germany with the dresses that I had made for us. That was at that time our only clothing, so we later on got some others. And we started from scratch. From nothing. Got ourselves jobs and then we were all fortunate to find husbands. Well, we were finished anyhow, huh? Q: What -- A: You too, huh? Not only happens to me. Q: Um, when you think back on this period of time and I'm sure the image is with you. A: Well, the image, of course, th at sticks most in my mind is when my parents were taken away on that truck. Never to be seen again. 34 Q: Other than all these very, how do you say it, health problems yo u went through, do you feel that phsycologically the experiences you went through at that time impacted yo u in the way you live your life? A: No, actually, that when we -- when I first came over here and then we first got married, actually my husband and I, we were so full of hate for Germany and all it stood for that we refused to speak German which now, I sort of regr et because my son could have grown up wi th two languages, but we just didn't want to be reminded. And actually, I mean, I -- I learned my English actually while I was working at the American army base from all the soldiers who came form all -- all parts of the country. So we really don't dwell on the past. I must say though that most of our friends are German or Austrian born. We have American bo rn friends too, but most of them are European born. None of them had been in concentration camps real ly. I'm the only one of that group, but -- so we never really dwell on the past much except for oc casions like this. Q: Have you -- did you befriend mostly Germans and Austrians beca use coming over here you felt more in common with them? A: Yes, first of all, we lived in the, what is called here in New York, the third ____________. Because it's only really occupied by European Jews. So we live ther e. In fact, there are many Jews living in that area now who mostly speak German. There is a park there that's called ____________ and that's up in that area. And if you go to that park you hear more German than English. So -- Q: You remember this -- do yo u remember different impressions when you arrived to New York? A: No, my first impressions were really the -- well, the statue of liberty of course. And seeing the tall buildings very impressive even though, I mean, from Berlin it's not ex actly a small city, but it doesn't have sky scrappers like New York. I was very much impressed by that and then I must say we were well taken care of at fi rst. You know, we were put up at a hotel for awhile, you know, to get out of my own. And we were made to feel at home. The relief of ____________ were really good. Q: Nothing that startled you about the lifestyle though? 35 A: Well, in those days the lifest yle was better than it is now a days. So, no, no thing really startled me too much. There was one poi nt ____________ furnished rooms here before I met my husband that a Jewish family had taken me into and I was taking care of their bo y. I was babysitting for them. Then again, I found anothe r, you know, furnished room later on and -- and then, you know, I got married very soon. Q: Is there anything else. I don't think there's to o much time left on this ta pe, but is there anything else you'd like to add? A: No. I think that's about it. Yeah, that's about all I have to say. Well, thank you. That is a picture of me in my home town of Penslo when I was about 10 years old. That is a picture of my parents and myself taken in 1941 which I carried around in my shoe, the original of this, I carried around in my shoe all through concentration camp an d had it reproduced. From left to right is my girlfriend Gerta, her sister Margaret and myself. All three of us are wearing dresses made from blanket covers that I sewed for us when we got back to Berlin. These are my girlfriends Gerta, Margaret and Lilly at their in the west. Q: What are they wearing? A: Oh, they're still wearing the dresses that I sewed from the bl anket covers. Q: Okay. A: These are my girlfriends Ma rgaret and Gerta at our wedding on October 5, 1947 in New York. This is an identification card that was issued to me in Berlin. I think by the Jewish community. I'm not quite sure. Q: When? A: Oh, in 1945 when I wa s back in Berlin. Q: Okay. A: With my name other than my birthday. Oh, wh at does it say there? Q: That's the German.
