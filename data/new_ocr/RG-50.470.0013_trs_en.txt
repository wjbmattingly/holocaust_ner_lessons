So this is how the day started, and it really, and eh the only contact with the outside world was through the window. And when we see through the window a strange strange thing happening. Because all of a sudden there appeared a German Gestapo's with canes as a m as a guard. And they were stationed all around on all corners around this area. And, eh but there were no SS, eh guard of any kind. There were nothing in the area, usually, for many days there was always a eh British airplane hanging about the camp. Spying over over the camp.

And at that time, the the block shook, because eh fighting began. And it lasted about seven hours, terrifying fighting and the all the walls were were shaking and of course we immediately thought that probably this is it.

And nothing happened again. And it took about another twenty minutes before we heard a individual shot ba ba hear and there from all direction and then I look in the window and I see there are a lot of people running towards the fences, prisoners from other block which was not in the quarantine. And I see that some of them are caring guns! Riffles already, you know. So we eh eh broke through the window outside be because door was still locked you know, and we started running toward the fences and we see that this area was completely already demolished. It took only maybe five minutes, to demolish all the fences, all the defenses of Dachau. And then I see in the front and on the corner you know, American soldier. He was walking..beginning to cry...and eh eh behind him were eh eh eh other eh eh soldiers and he were commanding the guards that were on the Dachau, Germans, to step, to descend and to surrender.

It was drizzling, rain drizzling when during that eh eh hour of liberation, but half the time went by and it cleared-up.
