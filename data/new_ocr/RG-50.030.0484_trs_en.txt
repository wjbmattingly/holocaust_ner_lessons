And -- but he was deprived of private business and he didn™t have any other profession, and they -- their life was very difficult, but they survived to the ti -- to th e time of war, and he was killed, and -- killed over there. And my next memory was -- Q: Let me ask you something. A: Sure. Q: When your grandmother and your mother we re being beaten, when -- when they left, were they very hurt?

I felt so bad for my he -- mother and grandmother. Q: Your grandmother. A: I remember she was holding me in her ha nd, and they were hitting her in -- on her shoulders, and her back, and -- and my grandmot her. They were hitting them. This -- this was my first -- Q: Right. A: -- first memory. And f -- after this -- and di -- fa -- unfortunately, my grandmother and my mother were talking very little about ghe tto. Very possible it was very hard for them. I don™t remember a lot of conversation at hom e about ghetto. But I remember some -- something or some -- Q: Incidents in the ghetto. A: -- incidents in the gh-ghetto, which actually includes me because something to sho -- Q: So it was a few months later, after you had gone to Zhmerinka that the ghetto started, am I right? A: No -- started, yeah, for a few -- few weeks or few months or so -- Q: Months, uh-huh. A: I believe it™s i -- in -- in short time. Q: Right. A: But what I remember my mother -- this is what my mother told me in awhile, that actually a lot of Jewish people started to come to Zhmeri nka very possibly there was a rumor that Zhmerinka will be safe for Jewish people. And they were told to bring goods for them. Their -- you know, their goods stu ff. And they actually, and I remember how my mother saved it, how ma -- how many nice thing they used to bring with them. And next my memory was that my -- there was -- a lot of people were working somewhere, and there were guards with the -- these huge whips, which were, you know, which -- which were hi -- Q: Hitting these -- A: -- hitting them, these people. And my gr andmother -- and there was a -- a -- f -- for awhile already, a fence of a barbed -- barbed wire. Q: Wire. 8 A: This I remember, this barbed wire. Q: Around the ghetto? A: I don™t remember it was around or not, but I wo -- I remember this row of people, and my grandmother was holding me in her -- in her hand, and it was cold already. I remember it was -- it -- very possibly it was early -- early autumn. Q: Mm-hm. A: Because it was cool, it was not cold, but it was cool. And it was a huge row of people, and these guards with whip. And could you imagine my grandmother, oh, it -- and behind this barbed wire there were other people -- different people. You can see -- I remember that I noticed that they are different. I noticed this, they™re different. And could you imagine my grandmother threw me away, ove r this barbed wire, and somebody took me. And next my memory that I stay in some little house with a strange woman, who is the age of my grandmother. And she was cons ole -- consoling me, and I was crying and wanted to go to my mother and grandmother. And she was not able to console me. I™d -- you know, I was very possible very -- I™m very stubborn child. Because I di -- I remember that I didn™t want her, and she -- you know, she took me out in the -- she got this little garden, and there were still apples on the -- on the tree, and she was shaking this apple to me, gave me -- to me, and I thought to myself, I don™t want your apple, I want my mother. This I remember right. Q: You remember that, yeah. A: Yes, I do, I remember my feeling. I didn™t te ll her, but I remember that I was crying, and eventually she gave me back. She gave me back. How, I don™t remember, maybe under the wire f -- was -- how did she give me back I don™t reme mber, but the next time I remember that I was with my mother and grandmother. And I will -- if -- insert something which my mother told me. It happen ed to be that this row of people, they dug the row. And they brought all the Jewish people who came here to Zhmerinka, and Zhmerinka™s people, Jewish people, to this row which they dug out yesterday. And these who were with whips, they w -- they were Ukrainian, and they were native -- they were people who stay here. And they knew who was from Zhmerinka, and who not -- Q: Right. A: -- who is not. And they supposed to tell who is from Zhmerinka and who is not. And actually my mother was not from Zhmerinka anyway. But some of them, who happened to be a nephew of this woman who took me to her house, told that my mother is from Zhmerinka, and this way my mo ther stay alive. And they killed all those people who were not from Zhmerinka, a nd those people who from Zhme rinka, but [indecipherable] killed down as in a grave. This was how -- 9 Q: So your grandmother thought th at you would all be shot -- A: Y-Yeah. Q: -- and that™s why thr -- she threw you over. A: Sh -- sure -- sure.

A: -- she was -- she was woman who for thei r child -- for her children, and I was only grandchild that time, she will do anything, sh e would. This -- this -- she was a very desperate woman, and besides she died in six -- in 1960, and they -- from -- you know, people from around -- around this place she used to live, came. It was like another demonstration. We never saw these pe ople who came to -- to -- to the s -- Q: To the funeral? A: -- to the funeral. Q: Really? A: Yeah. Oh, she was -- she was -- 10 Q: She was quite a person, huh? A: Oh she was, she was. She -- she didn™t know how to read. She -- she never learned it.

And how I remember being w ith my mother and grandmother put in one room with other women, there were onl y women. There was -- and among these women, I remember them very well, because after th e war my grandmother used to bring me to this place, it was a -- a Aunt Sura, Aunt Fa nny, and there was a very old woman who was paralyzed. She was sitting all day long in the armchair or chair, I don™t remember, but all of us lived in the same room, one room wa s. And this auntie -- and there was other women, and three of us, my grandmother, my mother and me. And there was -- there were no other children, if I remember.

Q: And did you understand that? A: Yes, I do -- I -- I did under stand and I actually foo -- you know, in my family, it was not the custom to -- in -- in the Ukraine [indecipherable] to speak Yiddish -- Q: Right.

My mother said it™s -- it -- me -- this was -- I ask her what was it. It was -- they were working to -- in potato field, and they will peel the -- sometimes they will able to bring home peels from potato, and this what -- what she was cooking for -- for me, and for [indecipherable] I could, but very possible I ate it, that I survived eating it -- Q: You can -- right, yeah.

I didn™t have to sit on the -- on the s -- toilet all day long, because I -- I could take care about it. And I started to go out. And I remember the Dr. Girsh, very possible you read about him, he was the head of that -- he was from Romania, and he was -- everybody said that he was very bad, he was with a whip all day long, and this whip was very often on the back of this -- of the working people. But I remember my mom™s expression, she said, ﬁIf he won™t be so strict, very possibl e we wouldn™t be alive.ﬂ And this is -- this I -- I -- I remember, I remember. Q: And did she explain what she meant? A: No. Q: No. A: I didn™t -- I didn™t ask because actually it was in the -- the end was [indecipherable] conversation. Q: Right.

A: -- of -- of his deat h, but I remember a-around Jewish holid ays, they usually lighten their candle, or the light for -- for Yahrtzeit of him. This is -- this I remember, this was after the war, already. What else of I remember of this, when I was able to get out of the h-house, because there was a -- like a -- and it was a b-barbed wire around, and I started to get familiar with o-other -- other people, and I remember there was a li ttle -- little boy in different home, because we had to walks little bit to see them. And I consider myself a grown-up, because he was little. I used to play with him, but he died. And -- he was sick, or something happened, or maybe of starvati on he died. And I remember my mom said we are going there, but he is not alive any more. He died and he is in the ground. And when we were walking, there was a lot of broke n glass. And th -- th -- my memory that I thought if this glass doesn™t -- doesn™t hurt him. This is my memory, was -- this is what -- what I remember. It means the glass was broken -- Q: Yeah.

Of course I was -- Q: Did you understand when your mo ther said that he died? 14 A: This is what I understood, th at he™s not of -- but I did not understand he is not alive, and this glass doesn™t cut him. Q: Right, yes. A: I -- I didn™t -- I didn™t rea lize this. This -- my memory that this glass very possible hurts him. Q: Yes, right. A: Because my mother -- mother [indeci pherable] me that he™s -- he™s -- Q: He™s in the ground. A: -- in the ground. Yeah, this is what I reme mber. And I remember there was another child who died. I don™t remember the -- the age, but I remember the -- this wo -- we visited this woman after the war with my grandmother, and she had -- she got marry -- she remarried, and she got a child, and my grandmother was very happy that she has a child because she lost her child -- Q: She lost her child. A: -- child -- her child during the war. And th en my memory from th e ghetto, I want tell you that I remember that Dr. Girs h was very good to me. From time to time I was by myself, I don™t remember ever as a ki -- children, or other people walking with me, when I was able to get out, and th-the -- fr-from this [indecipherable] I fo -- I don™t remember as a chi -- children. The only thing I remember very well -- and there was a boy, maybe he was nine or 10 years old, and he was starving very much, he was -- you know, she wanted to eat, and there was no -- no food. And he escaped. He was with his mother, and what I do remember very well, that his mother was hoping that she will come back ever. And she was staying -- there was a -- as you know, a gate from the same o -- for barbed wire, on the wooden posts. And she was staying and looking through the -- throug h this gate, and I remember her back. Very possible she was a big woman, or very -- very possible -- she seems to me a big woman. But her wide ba -- back, I never forget. This back was, you know, you can see in her back [indecipherable] by her back how she had the pain, and the -- and she was staying when they were coming. This is al -- always, always you can see her. She was staying with her face to this gate. It was such a -- you know, to -- I remember even how I fe -- I felt about her, this pain. I didn™t remember this boy, but I remember that my mom say, ﬁBecause you don™ t want to eat, do you see what happen?ﬂ This is -- this wo -- this I remember. A nd I remember when I was working, Dr. Girsh sometimes and he took me to his -- to hi -- to the place he -- he used to live, but this was in the same ghetto, bi -- if he in the sa me [indecipherable] fr om the barbed wire [indecipherable] you know, the -- the place. Q: In the same area, yeah. 15 A: Yeah, in the same area. Not -- it was lik e, you know, next house -- ne -- next door. It™s very, very close. She took me once, and I saw a woman over there, a nd being again a girl, she had the blouse on her, and she didn™t [indecipherable] this yellow star. And I remember how she looked like. And she ha -- once she had the white blouse, another time she took me, she had the red blouse. And I re member the blouses, because being a girl [indecipherable]. I paid attention, because everybody was gray, everybody was in gray, and here were colors. And what I rememb er, you ma -- from time to time the Germans were coming to the -- to ghetto, and everybody was so afraid because you know, German al -- always brought the death with them. And everybody was trying to hide somewhere. Once I remember we™re trying to hide in the deep cellar, and there was a ladder without -- with sa -- with missing some, you know, some this -- what is the -- with -- ladder with some missing -- Q: You -- planks? A: Planks. Q: The planks? A: Yeah planks. Q: In the cellar. A: Mm-hm. And fer -- and I remember that th ere was a man™s voice, I don™t remember who it was because was absolutely dark. He didn™t want to ask to go there because of me, because I was very little that he was afraid that I will cry, and Germans will hear -- wowould hear us. And I remember, my memory, w hy he think that I will cry? I am afraid the same s -- the same way, I would not cry, but I will not express it because my mom say to me do not open my mouth, and I didn™t open my mouth. And they let us in. Q: I™m going to have to stop the ta pe, and continue on the next tape. End of Tape #1 16 Tape #2 Q: Claudia, we were talking about you going into this -- A: A cellar. Q: -- cellar. A: Mm-hm, yeah. This -- that time, we really stayed in the cellar. Of course I didn™t pronounce a word, and we stay alive. And we went from the cellar -- this I remember very well, it was dusk already, you know, not a dusk, it was dawn. Q: It was dawn? A: Dawn it was, dawn, sorry. And it was light already, almost when we went out, it means all night long we were just staying in the cellar. And few more time it was very, you know, [indecipherable] it was the brightest part of my memory when Germans used to come because it is -- it™s really, you know, it™ s really was the most dangerous t-time. And once -- Q: You -- you understood that it was very dangerous by then? A: Oh sure, sure. I understood. I understood that they -- if I will cry, or if I will loudly pronounce something, some gost German will hurt us, and they will kill us. This I -- I understood. Maybe I did not understand about the death, about killing, but I understood that it™s very dangerous. Q: Dangerous. A: Yeah. Q: Yeah. A: And there were a few times when they put -- put me -- put somebody on the bed -- it was one bed in this room, everybody else was sleeping on the floor. I don™t remember who was sleeping on the bed, maybe me and my mother, my mother and me, maybe. I don™t remember. Maybe my grandmother because I remember all f -- always her warmth here, when she was so warm and soft. Maybe I was sl eeping with my grandmother. Th -- th -- I remember her softness. And a few times they were put somebody on this bed, and when German -- I remember Germans were coming [indecipherable] you know, the -- the head with the hide, this front and the gray her -- co ats, military coats, and black epaulets. This I remember, it is black on the collar, I reme mber very well. They™re high, though we -- I was little girl.

Q: Oh, typhus. A: Typhus. Q: Typhus, yes. A: Typhus, typhus, yeah typhus. They le ft im-immediate -- immediately. Q: They -- because they were afraid. A: Yeah, they -- this was -- this I rememb er there was a magic wart. Typhus was a magic wart. I -- I saw this magic wart, because actually there was no typhus in there -- in this -- after the war, my grandf -- grandmother wa s sick by typhus, but this was some kind of inside typhus, the inside infection. And once I remember they were not able to get into the cellar, because Germans came very ra-rapidly, and was very suddenly, and they put me in the barrel, and covered me with the wooden cover. Q: In the barrel? A: Barrel, mm-hm. I was little, I can fit it. This is how they hide me. And two times I remember t -- there was two times. Once, there was a strange young woman, her name was Sima. She all a of a sudden came to the -- to ours -- and she didn™t speak -- to our camp, and she didn™t speak Russian, she spoke Yiddish. But some strange Yiddish which I barely can understand. But the grown-up people understood her. Very possible she was -- she was escaping of some other place, from Romania, and she happened to be here. And she stayed in this room, and every time, when Germans were coming, she was the one who was put into the bed, and covered with all the sheets and everything, which was -- and they put me on the bed, because I was the smallest, one, it was not heavy for her, on the bed, and this way sh -- they were hiding her. And beso -- because of -- I don™t remember her in the gray dress, it means she was not part of this camp. Maybe sh -- they would not -- not make her working, I remember , but she lived in Zhmerinka after the war. Q: So she was saved? A: She was saved, she was saved. And beside he r, in awhile, there was a man who came to this -- to this camp. He was Russian soldie r. Maybe he was in capture, he was ca -- he was captured, and he escaped and this way he -- he came to this camp, I don™t remember, but he -- he™s arrived, too, and they got marri ed on th -- a-after the war, and we visited them, we stay in their house. His na me was Kiva. I remember very well. Q: Kiva? 18 A: Kiva. And wo -- he had in her -- in his hat, a star, a yellow star. And he gave it to me to play with. Believe me, I put it on my dress, a nd went very proudly, I went outside to walk as I am grown up. This I remember very well. I -- and all of a sudden there was passing -- a guy was passing me, I believe he was a German soldier. Yeah, he was a German soldier, he was passing me, he came back, he look ed at this and he started to beat me with his feet. Q: Kick you. A: Kick me with his feet, I was on the floor -- on the ground, and he was kicking me. He -- he threw out this -- this star, for -- together with the -- the -- that™s my clothes what™s -- with what I was in, and Dr. Girsh, and Girsh came, and he liberated me, he took me and he was talking to him some way, he must have been like he was talking to him, and he took me. And after, w-when my mother cam e from work, she was beating me. She was punishing me for -- for why -- why did -- did it. But I didn™t know that this -- this -- this is not six -- six -- there were not -- not si -- Q: Oh, i -- A: -- I -- I told -- Q: -- it was a -- it was not -- th e Jewish star was six stars. A: Yeah, it was a -- the -- Q: It was a regular -- it ™s another kind of sta -- A: -- it was a f -- a regular star, but I didn™t know, I -- I didn™t know how to count that. Q: But your mother was hitting you because -- A: Hitting me, punishing me for -- for -- for ca -- for -- for being show off. And nobody can see me, nobody was around. But I went out with a s -- with a star on my shir -- on my dress. This is what I remember, I re member even my feeling about this. Q: That™s the -- how did you feel when your mother hit you? Was this -- was this worse then? A: I was actually, you know, I was afraid of my mother there for -- f-fo -- for awhile. I was afraid, but there was my grandmother, whom I could always ge -- have, you know, to s -- escape to. Q: Yeah. Right. A: I was always afraid, she was strict wi th me, because the time was -- you know, I was [indecipherable] you know. The time was -- 19 Q: So she was afraid of losing you, yeah, yeah. A: Because she was a -- she was afraid of losing me, not -- not if she wanted to -- to -- even to punish me. Q: Right. But your grandmother was softer with you? A: Oh yeah, she was the -- I was her favorite, I was the ov -- oldest one, I was her favorite. Q: Uh-huh. A: She was certain -- I was favor -- a favorite of hers for-forever. Q: Forever. A: Yeah. Q: Yeah. A: Mm-hm, she was this -- she was a great woman. She was -- Q: What was her name? A: Her name was Rivka. Q: Rivka. A: Yeah, and my -- my mother name was Raisel. Q: Raisel. A: Yeah.

Q: Your mother and your grandm other™s name, that™s lovely. A: [indecipherable], uh-huh. This is [indecipherable] Q: Right. A: Very touching. And believe me I didn™t ask hi m for this. This -- this what -- he didn™t know my grandmother because she died before he was born, but he loved his grandmother, which is my mother, the sa me way -- way I used to love my -- Q: Yes. A: -- my grandmother. Q: Yes. A: You -- you know this. This was in -- they we re very close to each other, they were talking, and I believe he -- he became an Orthodox because of my mom™s -- my mom™s stories about before the war, how it was in shtetl, and how she always was listen, he -- he used to come to from school, having his lunc h with her. She always prepared for him the best -- the best in warm and fresh. They were talking and she was telling him stories about the -- before the -- when she was young. Q: Right, right. A: How it was when she was young. Okay, well, we were talking about ghetto. What else do I remember about ghetto? I remember -- actually, I remem -- the -- the most part of -- I remember when Germans used to come, and how dangerous it was. And we were -- I don™t remember how we were hiding the kid -- Kiva. I don™t remember, but he survived. This in -- this I know very well. How -- where he was, maybe he lived with us. For awhile he used to live with us in the same room. And after maybe he was staying in cellar for [indecipherable] because a man could not supo -- survive th-there, only women. Q: Really? A: Men -- men who can work, okay, no, he could no t survive because that™s -- if they were Jewish, forget about, he could not survive. Or they were at war, or they were killed. If not Jewish, they were [indecipherable] traitors. Traitors, po -- polizei they called it. So what for ge -- Q: So the ghetto was primarily women? 21 A: Women, women and children, primary. Maybe there were some old men, because one of those men who told don™t bring her to the cellar because she will cry -- she will cry. Q: He was a man. A: This -- he was a man -- man, I remember his voice. But I don™t remember how he looked like, because I don™t remember men. And I actually don™t remember if -- men in the shule, when my mom used to bring me, only women. And -- and this -- and Kiva, and this is the only one, and Dr. Girsh. And actually -- and for me, men -- men were a densh. Q: Men were dangerous. A: Yeah, for me they -- mi -- my -- my me mory of men was danger, you know. They ca -- they can bring death, that you cou -- you have to be afraid of that. But Dr. Girsh, who was -- I™d -- I was not afraid of him, of Dr. Girsh, I was not afraid of. Q: No, cause he was very nice to you. A: He -- he -- to me he was nice, but my mom said that he was [indecipherable] he was very strict, and he was beating with a whip, Jewish people. But my mom said that to be -- for him to be strict, this is how he show ed the Germans, you know, how to sur -- Q: Yes. Right. A: -- this way for he -- he saved us. Actually everybody -- every body who could survive, who -- who didn™t die from starvation, or from k-kind of sickness a- are [indecipherable] everybody survived actually Zhmerinka ghetto, is actually -- y -- you know? Q: How did other people treat y -- sinc e there were very few children -- A: Mm-hm. Q: Did they treat you well, or were some peopl e angry that you were alive, and their children were not? A: No, no. Q: No. A: No, I don™t remember anybody being angry with me, of these people. I don™t remember. Everybody was very nice to me. Q: Uh-huh. 22 A: Everybody. But I remember very few of th em. Even the -- these two women whose children died, I don™t remember during the war, them. I do -- I don™t remember them. They di -- they didn™t live with -- in the same room with us. Q: Right. A: A-And I don™t think -- Q: And that™s where you spent most of your time. A: Sure, only here, on-only here. Because I do re member this barbed wire. I remember wha - it was very close. This actually was the -- the same place. The -- it looked like I -- I would go out from the door -- Q: And it would be there. A: -- and it would be there. This I rememb er. And once I remember -- maybe not -- vu -- vu -- like my mom used to complain that I was a very bad eater, and this was a vu -- very big -- big problem with me. I remember once I went out and smell dragged me to -- and happened to be -- could you mention -- I rememb er this very -- the smell very well. It was a cheese which two Germans in the commert tr uck were sitting and eating from plastic boxes. It was like soft cheese, you know, so soft cheese, and they were eating like -- like this. And this smell of cheese was draggi ng me so hard. I was going there and I was staying and looking at them. But when they tu rned they faced me, I got scared, and I ran off. Q: And you ran away. A: Yeah. And this smell I brought with me after the war. I remember my aunt who [indecipherable] in the wild, she brought me to the restaurant, and she ordered the cheese, and I could not stop eating it. You know, this smell of cheese -- smell of cheese that the -- was, you know -- I didn™t -- I didn™t realize what is it, because I don™t remember the taste of cheese as the -- o -- of cheese, but -- Q: But you remember the smell. A: -- after -- after the smell, and after the wa r, it -- the smell brought me this memory. And after I remember that it was a big [indeci pherable], it was, you know, less something happened, and did you know, everybody was so excited, and Dr. Girsh wanted to take my mother and me somewhere. And my mother didn ™t want to go. And they put my mother -- the how they will -- they put her like Sima in to the bed, this one bed, put o -- o -- over sh -- her, all that clothes and the sheets, and put me on. And there was a soldier who came for my mother. And my grandmother was talk ing to him. And I didn™t understand when my gran -- grandmother learned it to -- to sp eak Romanian, or German. It happened to be Ukrainian. She was a traitor, she was a polizei . But my mother was talking to him and I did not understand Ukrainian -- Russian -- I understood Ukrainian -- Russian -- 23 Q: Russian. A: -- and -- and Yiddish, but n -- Q: But not Ukrainian. A: -- not Ukrainian. And when sh-she was speakin g with the -- the [indecipherable] I hear -- I told her sh-she speaks Romanian. And it ha ppened to be that Germans were coming. They were -- you know, they were go -- going, the Russian army was running them away. And everybody say that they on -- on their way they will kill us. Q: The Germans when they leave will kill you. A: Yeah. And that why Dr. Girsh wanted to ta ke -- very possible my mother was one of the youngest one. I didn™t know why -- I didn™t know why. Ma -- he wanted to take my mother and me with him to Romania some where. He was writing -- he was writing because he -- he didn™t belong to -- actually to -- to Germans, and he didn™t belong to Russian. He -- he was not -- you know, he didn™t belong to anybody. And he wanted to -- to take us, and my mother didn™t want to go. I didn™t know for which reason absolutely, you know, it was not nice talk about it, because I remember that -- maybe -- maybe my father was jealous about this, I didn™t -- I don™t remember, but it was not -- not mentioned at home. Q: Mm. A: In our -- in our home, about this, but I re member this [indecipherable]. And next time I remember that you can go out from this barbed wire. You -- you can go out. And we went out, and it was early spring. The weather was like -- like today. Really, it was like today, it was cold, it was raining. Q: Raining. A: It was very bad. And we went to this Sol oviyva -- to this Aunt Soloviyva house, because my grandmother and her, they were neighbor s. They were in good con -- relationship. And happened to be that rest of the Jew, who actually lived there, didn™t have place to go, and they went to the same house. And th e house was packed, nobody can sit. The house was very little. Now, when -- when I remember , that was really very, very small village house. She was baker, so she lived over there by herself. But again, because she was my grandmother™s friend, I was privileged. I was put on them -- you know, this fireplace they have like in -- in the village, where they used to bake bread, cook in the same, and if -- there was like a p -- piece like they can sleep when -- in wintertime, when [indecipherable] was cold, they were sleeping over there. She put me there, but there was no air to breathe. It was that the house was packed, and nobody allowed to open the window or door, because everybody was afraid that -- th -- th -- of this noise, the German will -- will do -- would hear us and kill us. And she put me on this -- and to -- to make me 24 breathe she was -- sh-she was pu -- she put a paper and sugar on fire, and this way she told she will clean up some air for me. I didn™ t know this was -- this was the way -- this I remember, the sugar and the -- and -- and the paper, and I was licking the sugar. I was licking the sugar. I was -- it was ™44. This was 1944. Q: Now this woman is the same woman -- A: Who -- Q: -- who took you in -- A: -- did -- yeah -- Q: -- when your grandmother threw you over? A: -- yeah, this -- this was the sa me woman. This was Aunt Solo -- Q: So it™s solo -- A: Soloviyva. Q: Soloviyva. A: Soloviyva. Q: Soloviyva. A: Aunt Soloviyva. This wa -- her last name I don™t remart -- remember her first name. And -- Q: Okay, so you™re in this house. A: In this house, and all of a sudden I hear this Aunt Soloviyva came in -- in, and she said, I saw him, I saw him, such a young, with a -- a fi -- on her no -- his nose, how this -- Q: Freckles? A: -- freck -- freckles on his nose. He™s so young, he -- very -- very possible he™s only 16 years old. It happened to be Russian soldier. And so she™s -- the first Russian soldier. And this breeze in there -- in this house, I heard like everybody like -- like, you know, let out the air. I -- this I remember very -- very well, like in the same time, everybody in the same time. Like -- like -- sigh like this. This I remember very well. And after this, people gi -- started to get out from the house, but we stay in the same house. We didn™t go f -- we didn™t have where to go. And it was very possible a morning, but the weather was like today, it was little of rain, and very, very uncomfortable outside. And was three of us, my mother was holding me in her -- her hand, my grandmother, and one plaid which we had 25 from I don™t -- from my grandmother™s house wi th us. And this plaid was covered in -- they covered from -- Q: It™s a blanket? A: Blanket. Q: A blanket? A: Yeah. But it™s huge like a -- like a [indeci pherable] blanket, they were able to cover themself. And we were walking, or staying, I don™t remember, and we see -- we see a man come -- approaching us on the ca -- this -- one -- his leg is, you know [indecipherable] on the crutch. Q: On the crutch? A: Yeah. And two crutches under his arm. Q: Right. A: And he was dressed differ ently. His -- his coat is different, not like Romanian or Germans, it™s different. This I remember. And I hears he say -- he calls ﬁRaichka,ﬂ which is -- which is name of my mother, it ™s like, you know, like nickname for -- Q: Yeah, Raichka, yeah. A: -- my mother™s, yeah. And my grandma -- fer -- mother said, ﬁMoshe.ﬂ And I know that Moshe, this is my father. I said, ﬁDaddy.ﬂ And my mother hit me, ﬁDon™t call every man your daddy.ﬂ She didn™t recognize him, but he -- it was my father. Q: And she didn™t recognize? A: She didn™t recognize him, and he actually didn™t recognize us, he di -- he recognizes this blanket. We were fi -- fi -- my mother was -- she didn™t look, she was so thin, and so -- so -- and my grandmother [indecipherable]. Of course he could not recognize me, because two years, you know, it™s a difference here -- Q: Right. A: -- is big. Very pop -- possible, and I was cove red with this blanket, because weather was horrible. Was very cold. This I -- I remember , it was very uncomfortable. And next time I remember everybody was sitting in the same r oom -- in the same room for va -- ghetto for s -- it was in the same room, they came back to the same room because we di -- w-we didn™t have where to stay. My -- my grandmot her™s -- the house where she used to live was destroyed. My mother didn™t live there. We came back to the same room, and everybody else collect to the -- the same room, and my father was talking -- telling to 26 everybody and holding me in his lap. It happened to be sh -- that he was participating in this Stalingrad [indecipherable] and he was wounded. And he was discharged from army, after one year being in the -- in the -- the hospital, he was discharged from army, but not having where to go, he joined his army because he was this ne -- radio technician for -- in the tank. And for this case he was sitting in the tank, he di -- he didn™t have to -- to walk. Q: Right. A: And this -- this way he was -- his army he came to tra -- Zhmerinka , and I think this is most significant th-thing, story. Q: Story that he liberated you. A: Yeah. Q: Yes. A: How he -- he li -- he actually liberated us . And being discharged from army, he stayed with us. Beside, the war still there. Q: Right. A: And because of this railroad junction in Zhmerinka, the battle was very hard. But my father stayed here, and you know, now as a young man, there was not so -- so many young men alive for -- a-around. He used to work for sugar plant. His -- his occupation was sugar planting, and the [indecipherable] was sugar -- sugar plant, if it -- you know, Vinnitsa, it was sugar -- sugar area, actually. Q: Uh-huh. A: And th -- a lot of people f -- worked for su -- for different sugar plants in -- in the Vinnitsa area. He started to f -- reconstruct -- reconstruct a chu -- sugar plant in Brailov, which is seven -- seven kilometers from Zhme rinka. This way, when we lived in Brailov, my mom used to st -- show to me the doors where the Jewish people used to live, and who came to this -- to Zhmerinka ghetto and were killed. And my mother and my grandmother were digging them down. Q: They were bringing them? A: Digging -- digging the deep -- Q: Digging the grave? A: -- the -- the graves. Q: And she told you that after the war? 27 A: After the war, she showed me the places, the doors of this Jew -- for Jewish tri -- houses, which of course were occupieded by -- by Gentiles. The people took over these houses right away. Q: Right. So these were the people that had come to -- A: To Zhmerinka -- Q: -- Zhmerinka -- A: -- and they were killed. Q: -- and -- and they were killed because they would not li -- were not from there. A: Because they were not Zhmerinka . They were not from Zhmerinka. Q: I see. And your mother and grandmother -- A: Yeah. Q: -- were digging the graves -- A: Digging them. Q: -- for these people before they were shot? A: For these people, yeah.

This is -- 28 Q: But let me -- let me ask you some thing about the ghetto for a moment. A: Sure. Q: Did you have bad dreams, do you remember, as a child, being frightened in your dreams and having nightmares? A: Of the ghetto, yes. But -- for a long time . But you know, I was actually very happy child, I did -- I remember clearly I was ha-happy child, and very, very independent, because I was by myself actually.

He didn™t have place for us to stay with them -- with him, that why we still stayed in Zhmerinka, somebody rented us a room. And one evening, very possible it was Frid ay night, or Saturday night, and I don™t remember. When a f -- there was artillery sound, and for us it was so common, like now if a plane is f -- f-flying, this noise is what -- so common. Bu t for some reason I say to my mom, ﬁBombing started.ﬂ My masa -- my mom said, ﬁGo to sleep. No -- no bombing, we hear it every day.ﬂ But it really was the worse bombing I ever saw.

And -- Q: But none of you were hurt? A: No, none of -- oh, no. The -- and when they came out, there were other people caming out, but there was no roof on the building. No -- there were just broken walls around. And we were walking, and everybody was walking around, it was like for somebody -- for something. Oh, and what I do remember, that my grandmother found her velvet skirt, and she made a dress for me, by hand, because it wa s only dress -- and the only thing which I very anxious that my dress won™t be lost .

And next day -- of course my father knew about this bombing, he came right away, on horses, and with carriage. And he took us and this carriage to Brailov, and we started to live in Brailov. And if somebody told that this actually was a club, it was a not place to live. But we lived in this -- we stayed in this club, because there was nothing, no other. And th is is where my -- it was in Brailov. And this is where my -- when my mother was wa lking with me, and showing me the doors of the -- of houses which used to belong to Jewish people who were killed in Zhmerinka, because they didn™t belong to Zhmerinka.

That™s why we went out and we stay near the river. I don™t remember it -- or it was a lake, or river, but how I see it is w -- w -- i -- i-it was very wide. And bombs were into the river, and this water was splashing. This I remember very fu -- very vivid dur -- during the night, but you can see because there was a very positi -- there was -- they were sh -- lights like flying, you know, lights, and after this bomb exploding into the river, or next -- next to me.

The handle was broken, and they were always afraid that they will si -- you know, the [indecipherable] Q: You will hurt yourself, yes? A: I™ll hurt myself with bro -- broken handle. And what -- what we ate, we ate gray noodles. Q: Gray noodles? Ever ything is gray. A: Yeah, that -- gray, it was gray. And I didn™t want to eat that. And if now I sh -- know why it™s gray, because of Germans, who stayed in Brailov, when they were leaving, they her -- they here -- put on fire them -- f -- warehous es with food which they had. And everything burned out, but there were leftovers of flour. And flour was mixed with the -- with the ashes. And -- Q: So it came out gray? 34 A: Yeah, that way, and this is where the flour which my grandmother and my mother used to make -- make noodles of, this was ou -- and I di dn™t want it, because they were very gray, and I was punished for this, that I didn™t want it. Of course, you know, at -- this a -- this my memories, and I don™t -- I didn™ t have any toys, of course. Q: No toys, right. A: Of course, no toys, of course. The first t oy which I had was a little white doll with all black, which my father brought from some kind of assignment to Vinnitsa, which was liberated from Germans already [indecipherabl e] still was, but it was far west from Vinnitsa already, and he had an assignment to -- to m -- Vinnitsa, and I remember when he came, he mentioned to my mother some names, and my mother was amazed that they st -- they still alive. And th -- they stayed in Vinnitsa, and when we moved in -- in 1946, we -- we moved from Brailov to Vinnitsa, b ecause my father had another assignment for -- for work. And we visited some people w ho my parents knew f r-from befor -- before the war. This is a -- but, it™s still a war. And my aunt, who was -- and all my uncles, my father for -- for was from the fami -- family onl y broth -- brothers, only boys were -- were in the family, and I don™t remember if I men tioned to you that my grandparents from my father™s side were still in Yaltshkov, and they were burned alive in the barn. They -- and somebody told my parents. My grandfather wa s very old. He remarried. He was widowed and he remarried my grandmother, who was the same age which is hi-his eldest son, who actually emigrated to Argentina. But nobody was ab le to keep in touch with him, and you know, we don™t know -- but somebody told me th at his name -- his last name was Royter, like mine, that there were fum -- f -- women™ s dress stores name of Royter, somebody told me.

Now, okay, they were at war, both his brothers were at war, one of them was killed, and rest were -- were -- came -- came from war. So some was [indecipherable] returned. My mother had only one sister, who was at war, too. And she was evacuated with her hospital which she was working for. She was like nurse™s aide. And she was ni -- she was educated like -- like some kind of languages. She used to teach Russian literature in school. She was educated and a -- in this -- in this field. But at war, nobody need -- needs lit -- literature [indecipherable] understand. She was a -- a nurse™s aide. She was the one who was -- who was running after the wounded soldiers, and bringing them the [indecipherable] and re locating them to the hospital. A very brave woman, and when she got the -- she got pregna nt, she was evacuated with her hospital to Uzbekistan. And -- and this Uzbekistan now. And somehow, during th is time we stayed in Brailov, we -- we found out that she is alive. My grandmother, you understand? You understand what -- what happened. We were crying again, it was such a happiness. And once my grandmother gave me, it was the ve ry possible Friday night, it was summer, because I was dressed very light, was very warm. She gave me a bath, and she was -- she -- we were staying outside this -- this room [i ndecipherable] steps, and we staying here at 35 -- I was sitting on the step, and she was feeding me with those gray noodles. And voo -- telling me the stories just to make me eat. And the story was about her daughter. And all -- all of a sudden we see near the fence, thr ee absolutely black faces. Absolutely black, I never saw such black people ever in my life, the -- even after. And was her daughter, my aunt, with her new hu -- with her husband and her boy whom she -- whom she gave birth to in 19 -- in the summer of 1942. He was born in ni -- 1942. He was three -- three years younger than me. And it happened to be that th ey arrived in the machine room of the train, and -- where the coal was. That™s why they were so black. They were [indecipherable] when -- when they came in w ith silver, sil -- the war still was there, and we were hiding sealed near the wall and [indecipherable] and I remember this boy was sleeping on somebody™s -- I was no t sleeping because I was afraid of this bombing, and he -- he was sleeping, he was sleeping like no -- nothing happened. And this was -- and we mo -- moved to another apartment which in -- which I was given a corner, and my toys were sh -- matchboxes, which I was cove r -- covering with pieces of material, old material, and this was my furniture, I was moving it around, and from one of the assignment to vin -- to Vinnitsa, my father brought me my first book. It -- it™s was a fairy tale about a frog -- a fr-frog which turned to the princess eventually. It was very nice book, I remember. It -- and it was actually fal ling apart, but I was keeping it together. It was tearing -- falling apart, the pages were falling apart, and my f -- if -- I was fascinated with this book, and I was putting it together, and I remember by pictures for the -- the -- you know, the sequence of the pages only by -- by pictures, because I -- I was not able to read.

I do remember wh a -- that why I was walking around like, and my mother was very afraid of me. When I learned how to -- you know, take care about myself, I was able to get out of this room. Q: Right. A: And I was walking around this, around I wa s walking just by myself, I don™t remem -- Q: Cause there™s nothing to do. A: Yeah, I -- I don™t remember anybody even ta lking to me. To -- two times I remember once when Dr. Girsh me -- took me once, twice to his -- to his room, this one I remember his girlfriend. And once when he took me when -- when I was beaten by -- by the German soldier, he took me to his room , and he even gave me something sweet, something little and sweet, this I remember . But I was beaten very hard, and this sweetness didn™t -- and could you remember, I was afraid when my mother will know about this -- Q: Yeah. A: -- she will punish me. I will -- I think -- I was thinking only about all my -- what will be when my mother will know th at I was beaten by soldier, that means I went out, from which I was -- very possible I was not allowed, but anyway, I we -- I went out, and I was walking -- Q: Right.

And my mother told me that she has to be -- me -- teach me how to dance in case of they will come, next time I have to initiate it. I had -- very possible -- according to what my grandmothe r told me, after the war I was youngest one, I was the little one who survived this. Very possible that why all these women who we met after the war were crying around me, because I was the -- the -- the -- Q: The only one. A: -- the smallest one -- Q: Yeah.

I don™t remember, because I didn™t remember having anything. But I remember it was early morning, and our aunt stayed with us, and her -- her husband was -- he was -- he suffered of his wound very well, and he was v-v-very hot. Hi-his wound was -- it was -- it was -- it looked very bad, it was very inf -- infected, and he was in the hospital in this -- this particular day he was in the hospital. And my mother -- they ma -- my mother come to me, it was early morning, and she was cr ying. And she said, ﬁVictory, and we are alive, but ah, we were robbed.ﬂ We had little ducks in the wa -- in the -- the pond next to the house.

A: -- staying next to us. But anyway, everybody was crying. Q: And he was speaking? A: Yeah, he was speaking. And after the war wh en they -- w-we lived in different places, and of -- after the war when there [indecipherable] after the war my grandmother used to bring me to Zhmerinka for Jewish holidays. She was still observant. And my uncle, my aunt™s husband, was working for kind of mill, because they had flour, nobody had what to eat, and they had flour. But in that time, fo r them to have flour, it was very dangerous because he would be -- he would be kicked out, even put into prison because he was not given this flour. It means he has to br ing this flour, nobody has to know. But my grandmother was such a brave woman, and such a nice, good -- she -- she was making bread, putting it under her coat, and bringing to people who are starving. That why so many people came for -- for her fu-funeral, b ecause she saved a lot of people from -- from starvation. And -- and she was bringing it to Zhmerinka for these Jewish holidays, and everybody was crying. When th ey saw me, they were crying. Q: Right. A: And Sima and Kiva got married. They built a house, which was very rare, but he was given a place, and sh -- they were -- they built a house, they had two girls, which I ch -- consider myself much older than they are, th ey were born after the war.

And they were very nice to us, and you have to keep up with us. This was my grandmother, she™s supposed to keep -- keeping peace everybody. And everybody was very cr-crying, seeing me, just everybody was crying, so had the -- this -- the -- Aunt Sura, and Aunt Fanny, and the family came back, and Aunt Sura had two boys, and one of them happened to be -- he was much older than me, but he was not at war, it seems to me, but I don™t remember him during the war. He didn™t stay with us in same room. Very possible he was in some kind of hiding. I rememb er him a-a-after the war, but he was -- his name was Gersh, like my husband. Q: Gersh? A: Like my husband™s name, Gersh -- Greesha -- ge -- in Russian calls Greesha. 40 Q: Greesha. A: Yeah, I remember him after the war, I do remember him. And -- and this a story I reremember, when the service was in some body™s house, somebody led the ser -- Jewish service for Jewish houses, and everybody was crying very hard because of -- everyone voo -- voo -- lost family during the war.

Q: Oh. A: I remember we were thrown out from the apartment in November when my sister was born, because of somebody from denun -- de noted on my father who had -- had -- Q: Denounced your father? A: Denounced my father, who had a high position, somebody wanted this position. And every apartment belonged to the plant -- Q: Right. A: -- which my father worked to. And when th ey kicked out him from job, they kicked out from -- from -- from apartment, and my moth er was staying in the sa -- with the same coat, with same blanket. It was November, and weath-weather was like this, was rainy, and we didn™t have where to live, and w -- we lived -- we moved in with my aunt, who occupied it with her family, to this time three children. Q: [indecipherable] A: Her -- her -- her -- her husband, her -- hersel f, three children and my grandmother in one room. Q: Yeah. A: And we moved in, and they sta -- stayed in some so obscure village, this was nothing, just horses, it is a -- I remember. And these horses were brought u -- brought me to school, like four kilometers from this place. Some times when the horses could not go because of snow, I was walking this -- this distance, in high boots. And the village was -- because we lived -- before we lived in Vi nnitsa, and I had city clothes. And we ca -- when we came to village, we could not change, there we re no money for change. And the boys were beating me up because of the short dresses. I remember I was afraid of the -- I was afraid of everything, I was afraid of those boys, I -- I was afraid to se -- to te -- tell my mother that I was beaten, because my mother was -- had trouble all by herself, with this little kid 43 in her hand, with my sister, and no place to live, my father jobless. And you know what it means Russia when you kicked out from one pl ace? Everybody knows a bout that, it is -- because you have so-called working passport, it ™s written i -- eventually my father f -- managed to fi -- find a job another village. Soon we moved to this village. There was a guy -- in this village a plant, was very nice plant, was very nice place, there were a lot of Jewish kids which I mingled with. And a ll of a sudden, there was a gra -- it was 1951. There was a guy by name Swigun, I remember him very well. He was ki -- he came as a assistant of director of this plant. Nobody need, the plant wasn™t not such big, nobody need assistant, but he was assigned it™s assi stant. All Jew were kicked out of this plant during the next week. And these people were staying out of the apartments like we used to stay, and my father found out before. He went to Vinnitsa, and he found another job, and we moved out, we were not kicked out. This time we were not kicked out. But the old people, I remember my friend, her name was Claudia, too. She was my girlfriend. Her -- her grandmother was paralyzed, and they were dragging her out, there was no -- no -- out on the street. This I reme m -- it was after the war. I was afraid of everything. There was [indecipherable] there were -- th-there was -- Q: It was a very difficult time. A: -- difficult life. Q: Yeah. A: It was -- it was horrible life after the war. Q: And you were conscious of being Jewis h, it was very clear that you were Jewish? A: Yeah. Q: Yes. A: This -- you know, I am proud now. I was very conscious to be Jewish, and I never -- you know, never hiding this. Besides, I always fe -- I felt that I am Jewish. Only place where was good for me, it was this -- this -- before this Swigun came, because there were -- I -- other Jewish boys and girls, only -- only -- but it was very -- for very short time. Q: And then it was difficult for you to identify as Jewish yes? A: Yeah, yeah, it was very diffi cult. It was der -- very difficult, for one reason. I was taken by my very far aunt to Leningrad. Q: Mm-hm. A: I was like from -- from -- from fifth grade to eighth grade I stayed in Leningrad. This was the worst -- worst time in my life, because there I was identified as a Jew, and nobody wanted to speak. I didn™t have friends. Absolu tely I didn™t have friends, I will -- I was by 44 myself. I remember very well always listening to the rad -- to the radio. I knew all operas for -- which were translated by -- by radio, by heart. Because I didn™t ha -- only school and home. Q: And home. A: And my aunt, she was lonely woman, and she was deaf, and she was -- she was not very nice. I believe now she was -- she had this -- some kind of mental sickness. Not if I was afraid with her, but I was aggravated with her. She was t -- she was telling me bad stories about my grandmother, which I didn™t be lieve, of course I didn™t believe, my grandmother was entire world for me. And sh e was telling me bad -- bad stories about her, I didn™t like her, and I e-eventually one summer, and during the break, I didn™t go back to Leningrad, I stayed in the village. And -- but to this time, before of my father has a but -- had the position in -- on the plant, being I was one Jewish, and another Jewish was my sister. And I had a friend who was ha lf Jewish, her father was Jewish. And for him it was very difficult to get a job. His mo -- her mother was working, and her father was taking care about household, because he could not -- Q: Because he couldn™t get a job. A: He could not get a job. And my father would not be able to get -- give him a job, besides he g -- he got the position. It was -- you know, there was a choice, or you working, or you giving the job to -- to another Jew, and you w ill both be kicked out of the plant. It was very difficult time, horrible time, we were -- we -- I -- I remember my mom, who™s -- she was -- she was very skilled cook. She was maki ng potato soup, and some kind of stuffed potato skin for the second course. And there wa -- there was only meal. And eventually we got a cow, and my mom, w ho was actually a city girl -- a shtetl girl, she didn™t know -- she was taking care about this cow, and we had the milk. And I remember people are coming with glasses to our house, asking for a glass of milk. Q: Ah, you had a cow. A: A cow, yeah. Q: And people wanted milk, cause they didn™t get it. A: Ki -- ki -- they didn™t get that. Q: Now, everyone is suffering, whether they ™re Jewish or not Jewish because the -- A: Again. Q: -- the economic and physical situation is terrible.

And I tried to see beauty around, it was difficult for me. You know, I saw these people, and these people who had a gray faces, believe me, this -- they had a -- I don™t know from lack of vitamins, they had gray faces, very severe look. And this -- this what I remember about Le ningrad, I didn™t like it. And when Stalin died, I was crying like everybody else, I was a girl, you know, everybody was crying, and I thought that di -- you know, the end the world. Everybody was crying. And I came to school crying, and this girls was staying like this, ﬁAre you crying? Because you Jew killed Stalin.ﬂ Because there was a story with Jewish doctors -- Q: That it was Jewish docto rs, right, in ™56, yes. A: -- i -- i -- if you remember, yeah.

Never mentioned it. A-And I wrote th at I was in occupied territory. And my supervisor, who so -- who wanted to give me a job, he was a Jewish -- old Jewish man, he said, ﬁIt™s so bad that you were on occupieded territory.ﬂ I thought, if you would count, I was two -- from two to four years old, what -- what™s such a does -- what did, you know, what actually can -- what harm to the Soviet Un ion I can make in this -- in this age? And the -- when I told the story to my friend, just treat it like a joke, he -- they -- one of my friend made a -- a [indecipherable] poetry, I lived in Russia, about me being a spy in -- a spy in two years -- Q: It was in occupied territory.

When I have to go to school -- we lived in village. When we came with my mother, we came to Kiev because I wanted to -- I wanted to study in the same school which my father did for [indeci pherable] like this family. And I came to Kiev, and in fren -- y -- this was not the si -- subways train outsti -- outside train. I saw Jewish faces, I decided that I want to live here, because I was so afraid about -- o-of big cities after Leningrad, being outcasted so much, that when I saw here Jewish faces, and Kiev was a f -- the fa -- city of the -- a lot of Jewish people lived b ecause still before the revolution, and everybody who survived bu -- came back to Kiev and in Kiev somehow you can -- it was difficult anyway, being Jewish [indecipherable] was very difficult. But anyways, better than Leningrad, for example. And for -- I stay in Kiev, and I don™t know for which reason, but my memory, I was befrie nding only Jewish boys and girls. I -- for some reason -- by the way my sister didn™t -- did not, she married a Gentile, she married that Russian, I was -- very -- very possible because I suffered from an -- anti-Semitism all my life, being o-only one in school, and being one in school in Leningrad, and being so outcasted, that I want to be among my -- among my own. Q: But you were clear that pe ople looked Jewish, to you? A: Looked Jewish, when they looked Jewish to me. Q: Were you correct most of the time? A: Most of the time, yes. Q: Yes? A: Yes, I was. Q: Hm. A: Most of the time I was Jewish -- I was correct. And I stayed -- I rented the c -- it -- it cal - it call a corner, it means a bed. And my la ne -- landlady was Jewish, and I was very anxious to bring everybody whom I meet, and wh om I befriend to -- for -- for her to see them, because she has to know whom I am with, because you know, that she -- very possible she™s -- you know, t-the -- I want to -- her to know that I -- that everything is okay. Q: Right. A: And this way I use [indecipherable] Jews, a nd I thought that if they are Jewish, they are okay. I don™t know, I was like a [indecipherable] running to the [indecipherable] Q: [indecipherable] A: -- boys and girls -- 49 Q: Right. A: -- but anyway, I thought if th ey are Jewish, and they have family Jewish, it means that they okay, they brou -- they brought up properly, that mean they™d -- are not --- and they - and besides, everybody went -- try to go to ha -- to college, or is in the college, which means, you know, it means that, you n -- they™re certain level -- Q: Uh-huh, right. A: -- of, you know, the education, makes people -- firs t of all, they very occupied that -- with -- with lessons, and with -- and they didn™t have time for -- for bets -- the -- for -- for betting. And very soon time of Khrushchev came, Stalin died. There was this open letter, so called. Y-You know, when they open letter was read, i -- I was still in high school. I believed every word right away. I didn™t know about it. But in my home sometimes, my father mentioned something. But believe me, I was very much against this because I want to be like everybody else, I want to mingle with -- with -- and my father was so against government, against the -- you know, he didn™t s how it -- beside that cu -- beside -- behind the door of our apartment. But -- Q: You mean ou -- you mean -- oh, you mean outside the door. A: Outside the door. Q: But inside, he did. A: But inside, sometimes he mentioned it. Q: So, did you consider yourself a Communist in some way? A: You know, pioneer. Q: Pioneer, okay. A: But no Communist. Q: Yeah. A: When it came time to be even in Komsomol , even in young Communist party, I was tre -- cynical all right -- Q: Uh-huh. A: -- de -- about all this hi -- all this. And when Khrushchev came, and all my friends and me, we started to read the literature, which was -- which was prohibited in Stalin™s time. 50 Q: Right. A: And of course from that time I was - you know, I didn™t believe exists a -- a civil government forever -- fo -- fo -- from -- from this particular time. This -- I™ve -- when -- when I was growing up, I was already re -- ready to go. Q: You were ready to go. A: Yes. Q: So, can you explain to people wh at it meant to be a refusnik? A: Again, I was [indecipherable] a refusnik. Because first of all we get the job, because of us trying very hard. My husband had very bad job. He had to change the job to be a refusnik, and he was -- like my father refused to ta -- tell me look at this, what she made of that -- of this guy, he was a man, a mens ch [indecipherable] and now he be -- he became a frightened man because he -- he used to bring his is d -- you know, these gloves, this -- you know, the fa -- because he, who very -- very often he -- he had to, you know, to load the truck and unload the truck. And it was really very difficult. Besides, we were -- because of my husband had to change a job, his salary was half of the salary here he used to have. And because of everybody™s salary was from -- just fr-from salary to salary, we suffered a lot. And only because of again, my mother was a very -- you know, fu -- very frugal cook, this is how you can survive. We did -- didn™t -- we never had any savings on us, ne-never had. And at work I never talk to anybody about America, about my intention to leave. Everybody knew because they had to take paper, and they supposed to, you know, condemn me in voice. Th e -- the lot of people who just supported me, but they suppose -- what they supposed to. And I remember even this old man who is -- who fa -- who didn™t want me to write that I was on occupieded territory, he was the one who supposed to condemn me. And he di dn™t know how to do it. He said, ﬁLook at this, I work fo -- with you for such a long time. I never knew that you wanted,ﬂ he didn™t know what to -- v -- what -- what else bad to s -- to tell. He didn™t know. I was like everybody else, I was coming to work, I was a consciousness at work, I was doing -- I love my work always. And you know, I was brought up as -- you know, I have -- if I come -- if they gave me work, I have to -- Q: Do it. A: -- I -- I have to do it. Q: Yeah. A: And -- and actually it was -- actually it wa s difficult to complain about me. And I wanted to tell one story, because this story was significant enough. When there was, you know, the -- su-supposed to be meetings to condemn me, to tell bad thing about me, that -- to -- that I am a traitor, I want to leave my country, my cu ze -- you know, my Fatherland -- Fatherland for some kind of America, a-a nd supposed to be like this. And somebody 51 supposed to represent me. There was this foo -- of general -- retired general who was a head of personnel department, w ho was very nice, because he was -- he -- he -- he grew up among Jewish boys and girls who help hi -- him before the war, be -- became a man sh -- and they decided -- in my division, they decided that head of division would not go because they will re -- ij -- j -- remind him of all the mistakes we made. You know, he -- head of department, e-everybody. So he decide -- decided that his assistant will go, that™s me. And his assis -- assistant was Jewis h. He was very nice, very handsome man. Handsome and to -- could -- you know, everybody in the -- in this -- in my cu -- company was talking about h-how nice, and how handsom e he is. He is now here. His name is Weiss. I --I would like to have his -- his name , because I never forget what he had done for me. And he was s -- s -- charming, and he was the one, if there was some problem, he was sent to -- to -- to sol -- to solve this problem because he was very charming, everybody was -- you know, was -- was charmed by him, was the -- because he was the -- he -- he was the one. And he f -- everybody, they decided that he will represent me. Like when we came, there was a committee. There was a -- a chief engineer, who was -- he wa -- who was a Schwarz, he was a anti-Semite. I didn™t know before, because I -- you know, on my position, then his position, we were very far from each other. I didn™t know. There was this Barbara, which I told you, who -- who was assistant of this h-head of personnel department, who was a cou -- who was undercover KGB, everybody knew that s-she is undercover to KGB, but what can we do? And a lot of other people, among them are Jewish people, too. Was a secretary [indecipherable] of party secretary, who was anti-Semite number one. But he was drunk, I re member where f -- my friends who was working, they said, ﬁOh, you know, we had to make a picture of him, how sometimes he will -- he is coming from work, he could not walk, he went to -- to -- to the train [indecipherable] and this pi -- picture will - will make him tell about you the bad thing.ﬂ But then nobody made this picture, and -- a nd there was few other people. And to keep me at work, which I ask them to keep me at work, do not fire me because I knew that we will be refusniks, and we have to survive somehow. This, you know, assistant is Yuri Wizer, this what I thought, he who represen ts me, said about me good things. And he signed up the punishment for him. And now everybody said, ﬁHow can you tell about a traitor, about the person who want to leave he -- her Fatherland, good things? She™s the worst person we can di -- how can you?ﬂ And everybody forgot about me. Q: And started -- A: -- for the moment, and started with him. And it was like for two hours. I will tell you, I was so tense. I didn™t know how will I come to morrow to work and look in his eyes, if he will still here after everything they told about him, and this Barbara, who happened to be -- you know, she -- of course she liked him, but he was -- he was very respectable man, that was far for her. She was -- she was th e one who was -- her -- her language was the most -- the most -- the most powerful against him. And after two hours, we walked out in silent. We didn™t talk to each other. Ever ybody came. He went to his office, he had the private office, and I came to my -- and -- to my room where I work, and nobody from co workers ask me how it -- everybody saw. And was so silent, nobody was talking, everybody understood that there™s something to -- something terrible happened. And I didn™t know if they will keep him at wor k. I -- I didn™t think about myself already 52 because I felt so bad about him being so brav e to -- to -- to represent me. Well they made an -- in the end of their working day, he came to my he -- to the room, looks at every -- every group, every [indecipherable] had the room, separate room. He came to my [indecipherable] room, and he ask everybody to leave, just me to -- to stay. And he approach me, he said, ﬁClaudia, don™t worr y. Nothing happened. If you would need more m-my help, I will go.ﬂ I never forget. It is so -- sorry -- and believe me, because of this anti-Semitism, I was -- I didn™t tell anybody this. I wanted everybody know how brave he is, but I could not tell, because he made su ch a -- you know, tha -- such a -- and I didn™t tell about this to anybody before I found out that he is here. Q: Really? A: When I found out about this, he got -- he is older than me, and he came later, and it was very difficult for him -- him to got a job. And this is -- okay, and he -- and I got an offer from a guy who knew me before, a young guy, he became vice-president of the company. And he insisted on me to get a job for -- in his company. But I had my job, and I didn™t feel like leave my boss. Y-You -- we have very good relationship, it™s very small company actually, and I didn™t feel like, and I decided I will try to offer to Yuri this job. I will tell Yuri that there is a job. And I call him, and I told him that -- I -- I found his telephone number. I told -- I called him and I told him, do you remember this story? I never forget it, and only now I want everybody to know. And everybody who used to work with us, and who is here, and I t -- I telling the story everybody. Because I never for-forget. You -- you should know who he was. He was, you know, like a symbol of -- of -- of engineering mind, and being so hands ome, and you know, it becau -- even that he was a Jewish didn™t -- you know, it didn™t bother -- bother everybody be -- because he was so respectable. And he had the -- you know, he had -- had guts, like American say, to -- to stand next to me, and to protect me. This is -- this was -- but he did not get the job, it was difficult for him with language ver-v ery much. And he was, you know, he was retired already, he -- he was 65, he said, you know, ﬁI got my social security, and I -- I am happy with that. My son is oka y, I -- he -- thank you so much.ﬂ Q: Right. A: And we were talking for a long time. He to ld me about company, how it™s a ta -- ta -- how it became. It actually fell apart when I left . Not because of me of course, it™s Soviet Union who fell apart, and nobody had money to - to support such a -- such a big cor -- cor -- company, which designed paper, which ne eds for of -- they need it for propa -- for propaganda, paper for the -- the -- after -- after weapon, it was next -- Q: Next thing, right. A: -- next very important producti on in Russia, this was -- this -- Q: That™s quite a story. A: This was a story, yeah. 53 Q: Okay. A: Mm-hm. Okay, maybe -- End of Tape #4 54 Tape #5 Q: Claudia, how would you define a refusnik? A: A refusnik actually, what does it mean? It means when you apply to leave the country. You apply to special organization -- organization for special permission, which actually belonged to KGB. It is -- it is a division -- Q: A division? Uh-huh. A: Yeah, it™s division of KGB. They put you on th e list. They -- they do not -- they denied your application, they would not let you to go, but they put you on the list of people who want to leave -- who want to leave their Fatherland. Q: So they refuse, and you become a refusnik? A: Sure, sure. Q: So that™s -- that™s where it comes from? A: Yeah, they refuse it, and we became refusniks. Q: Refusniks. A: Yeah. And being on this special list, you have a special treatment, according to it. It means that actually -- well better -- you better do not apply for another job, for different job, because not only -- you know, if -- or very possible, people who give you the job don™t know about that you™re a refusnik, and you don™t o-offer it, you don™t talk on it to them. But in while, their in-information w ill come to the personnel department, every company had the personnel department, and every personnel department had somebody from KGB. And eventually this information will come. Q: Mm-hm. A: And not only you who will suffer for -- but the people who want you to hi -- who want you to work for them, will suffer from the -- fro -- from this. They can™t have food, different co -- different co -- diffi -- difficulties at work, with -- especially with different party organization which were very powerful. Q: Mm. A: In the -- in government they didn™t do anything technically, but government the people, and through condition and position and salary, especially salary. And everything was under their control, and they -- when they find out that you are refusnik. If a -- besides, just have -- talking with Grigory, we were under control of this -- of -- of local police -- police -- the, you know, f -- and we had our local policeman coming to check on us every 55 month. It means that he was checking if there are group of people gathering together, and maybe were talking about something. Th -- maybe we read some books which we not supposed to read. They control this too. Or paper, or su -- maybe -- by the way, my sister was here like eight years before they let us to go. And f -- wh-when you -- there [indecipherable] the stamp of this guy who censored the [indecipherable] his woo -- his number was K9. And when there were sh -- no t -- no -- to foo -- from time to time we didn™t have letters from -- from them, and wworried a lot. And my husband used to say to my mom, who of course worried abous -- about her daughter most-- mos -- more than us, she said K9 now on vacation. Him -- and that why we li -- we don™t have this -- Q: [inaudible] A: -- that you tell them from the state. That why you have to be very careful when you talk on the phone, what you talking about. And there were -- some got -- not with us, but there were sha -- a few times when they come to refusnik™s apartment, to the place where the people who were refusniks live, and blame th em in having drugs. How -- they put some kind of like baking soda on the refrigerator. Don™t -- for -- you know, the -- the powder, white powder. And they say that this a drug. They put themself. They are searching, they put this themself. [indeciphera ble] got it was not with us. And we actually were careful with -- no, we had -- we had our friends -- our friends did not -- our -- oh, by the way, sometimes even friends tried to avoid you, but we were lucky enough. Our friends who were not going to leave Russia because of the job, both -- you know, old parents, who could not wor -- who don™t want to go, they could not leave them -- Q: Right. A: -- by themself. Q: Yeah. A: Different da -- da -- differe nt conditions. They did not avoid us, they still keep in touch with -- kept in touch with us, but we tried to not put them into danger. We never talked to them on the phone about our shu -- not -- w-we really talk about our ti -- our ch -- i-intention to leave, and they knew about, and this was our main goal in the life, everything was -- you know, everything was in while. Before we leave. You know, it was like w -- we lived like in temporary condition. Q: Uh-huh, right. A: It is not in -- you know it™s -- it™s now, but we will, we -- anyway we will leave. Q: You were waiting for the future, uh-huh. A: Yeah, we will leave, we will wa iting for -- from -- and to -- to leave. And this is -- this is -- was our life. Of course we cou -- could not change a job, we could not move, we™re -- oh, about moving from town to town, when Chernobyl happened, our son lived -- was in 56 Moscow as a student. And actually before Chernobyl he could get an assignment too after the college, because in Russia was -- in [indecipherable] was the rule, you finish the college, and you work according to your assi gnment. You don™t look for who -- for -- for your job, you have to work two, three years where they send you. And after you can -- you can be free. Q: Mm-hm. A: And it was possible that he can come back to Kiev, it -- it was possible because he was a [indecipherable] student, he had -- he had the privilege of his hi-high -- high marks in -- in college. He had some kind of privilege to choose the place. But when Chernobyl happened, we didn™t want to -- him to come back to Kiev, because Kiev became dangerous city to live, especially nobody wants to -- for their children, to live th -- this -- and we started to think maybe we will move some -- somewhere close to him, you know, change -- we had the -- not the bad co-op apartment which my parents helped us to buy, and they lived with us, and this was our actually ti -- we left this apartment. We left because of there was, you know, we were al lowed to bring in United State, 150 dollars, which is -- which was equivalent to 3,000 dollars -- or 300 dollars in Russian -- in Russian money. And our apartment that time was six and a half thousand dollars, which is, you know, anyway this money -- we g -- we got some money we left to -- from my mother-in-law a little bit, little bit to my sister™s mother-i n-law, little bit, but you know, this is actually nothing. I actually can buy this ga -- dress for this. This is -- this is the only thing we ca -- could d -- could do. And in this -- this is 150 dollars, which we were allowed to take -- take with us. And what -- and -- Q: Did you move from Kiev? A: No, and we were trying to move, and we actually found an apartment not far from Moscow, it was not in Moscow, it is one of -- one of the small towns around Moscow. But was such thing we could not move, because of prescription to this particular place. But this is not only refusniks, this was in -- in Russia there was a rule, you prescribed to this apartment. And you could not move. Q: [indecipherable] you can™t move, yeah. A: And you could not move. Q: Right, okay. A: Not only to another city, to a nother -- to -- to another apartment. To -- to -- you have to have permission, government permission to move from this apartment to -- government permission to -- for to move from one apartmen t on. And this is of course we could not -- we -- we could not move, it just -- we just found it, but it didn™t go -- go fast, no paper were -- were from -- allowed. And actually this is -- this is what [indecipherable] and wh-what -- w-we were unde r -- under control -- 57 Q: Right. A: -- were under [indecipherable] you know, we were under the hoot. Q: Were most of the people who were refusniks Jews? A: Sure. Q: Or not? A: Sure. Q: Yes? Yes? A: Sure. First of all, why? Because -- because of the situation, the [indecipherable] sit -- situation, there aren™t -- anti-Semitism was govern ment politics. It was permissible to not take people to the college. By the way, I h -- I was a [indecipherable] enough student, and for to get to the college, you have to -- to get exams, you know, exams, tests, tests. Q: Yes, tests, right. A: Tests was very hard, harder than the -- than tests in school, like five, six times, believe me. Very -- very often there was a -- they questioned you, something which is absolutely out of the school program, just to make you -- and my husband, he w ill tell you, he -- he -- he went through, just to make you do not answ er it. And there was a score, 25 it was the biggest one, 24, was permissible, I had 23, and I could not get to the co -- to the college, but with same mark my landlady, who I hired the corner from, she helped me to go to another school not so prestigious, li -- like I want to, and was really not very famous, but that™s it, I went to this school and I graduate d that -- that school, which didn™t give me the profession I wanted, absolutely. Q: What did you want to study? A: I wanted to be a technol ogy engineer for sugar plant. I wanted to [indecipherable] Q: Oh, to work with your father™s company -- A: Yeah, and I knew this technology because I went to -- when I was in school I was working part time, and my hus -- and my father had difficulties, I told you, in -- at work, and sometimes I just went to work just to earn some money for -- for -- and I was -- during the time I was in school at night, I was working at the -- at the plant, because plant when it works, it works actu -- actually only few months a year, it produces sugar from -- it works 24 hours. That™s why I was able to work at night, and I love this -- I like this [indecipherable] production. I knew everything about that, and I loved it, and I wanted to -- but it was impossible actually, the -- I ac tually don™t know anybody of my age, Jewish, to be in this school, during this time. 58 Q: Uh-huh, during that time. A: Yeah, and that why he -- why by the way n -- a lot of Jews [indecipherable] from Kiev went to different obscure towns in Russia, where they didn™t even saw Jewish -- Jews before. And they didn™t pay attention to it. And they got -- they studied there, not only because they were [indecipherable] refusing thing, they were Jewish. Q: Right. And what -- what did you study? A: I was -- I was at the chanot -- sillicut ceramic, different kind of ceramic, which for [indecipherable] fro -- for dishes, glasses -- Q: So is that struc -- is that what they call structural engineering? A: No, no -- Q: No. A: -- it was not the structural , it was a technology engineer. But when I decided to le -- and assess -- assess this technology in the -- technology engineer for -- for this ceramic, I was working on this military plan, which my profession was okay for this, it was s -- compliant with this. But I decided to leave, I wanted to leave. And I left this military pplant, where to go? There was only design co mpanies, very bad pla -- factories, very, very old fa -- old military productions, this is -- was, and my neighbor ca - say to me, you know, in structural depart -- department, we™ll always need people. And I was an engineer here on -- on the plant, and I went as a technician, actually as a drafter -- draft -- draftsman for -- for -- to -- in structural department. And very soon, because you know, I had the background, I had the -- from I had th e college background, I -- to -- very soon I understood what -- what we™re doing. And the group of people moved it -- it™s before we were refusniks. Q: Mm-hm. A: It is -- was before -- before we applied, b ecause my husband still could not find a job, he was still working on -- and you could not apply, because nobody will take documents from us, because he is working on such a secret plant. Besides, he didn™t -- being a Jewish, he didn™t have the -- the -- a level of secrecy he -- he would -- the -- really he -- he™s supposed to have on his position, a foo -- over there, he -- he™s supposed to have, but they didn™t give it to him because he was Jewish. And from a group of young people my age went to little company who -- which were de -- designing brick -- like production, there was brick ovens, you know, this bi g -- how will you call it, where they [indecipherable] the brick? Q: Ovens? 59 A: Ovens -- Q: O-Ovens, but this is when -- when you do something from ceramic and you put it on fire, how are you calling that? Q: Oh, right, you -- A: Oh, it™s a -- a special name, I he -- Q: No, I know what you mean, you -- A: Yeah? You -- Q: -- when -- when you -- a kiln. A: Kiln, kiln, kiln. Q: Kiln A: Sure, thank you so much. And the -- they we re designing this, but this was a structural department because it™s supposed to be sp ecial foundation for this kiln, and the -- eeverything. And they took me, and th-th-th-t his company had the oof -- and from this compa -- working here part time, I went to stru ctural colle -- to -- to college, and became a structural engineer. Q: Uh-huh. A: This is when I was working as a -- as a struct ural -- and after one of this guys whom I left here -- actually, in this company when -- when we moved all together, it was a [indecipherable] there were Jew -- a group of Jew who were working there, and they were making -- because this was something for collective farms. And this collecti -- collective farms, it had some kind of pra -- like manuf ort them, and they can pay their own money for this crowns, for the -- and this cr -- this way, this company [indecipherable] company was making money, and the Jewish people were making some money too. Forget it -- they were hunting. Everybody was kicked out. Everybody -- everybody who had the position, he -- and th-they were th -- replaced by -- by this me mber of party, that member of party, and -- and these Jewish boys who were structural engineers before, who took me with them, they left br -- just do -- just -- th ey were afraid that that were -- will be kicked out. Q: Mm-hm. A: Beside, they were not head of departments, they started from the head of departments and they m -- they were different thi -- a projec t -- project managers -- you know, project managers were one thing, and there foo -- foo -- and the people who were negotiating it, and who were making the money. And these peop le, a lot of them we re Jewish, and they 60 were n -- doing very well for -- and compa ny was doing very well [indecipherable] they were Jewish, of course they were kicked out, and -- and this -- my co-workers, my friends actually, they were afraid that they will be kicked out, but I was on such a low position that to foo -- nobody -- nobody was paying attention to me, and I was able to finish the s -- the school over there. Soon as I finished one of that™s my friend, they could not let me to stay there, he was afraid of me. He found me the job on th is company which was designing paper [indecipherable]. And working on this paper [indecipherable] and this company, I shill applied -- not -- not soon enough like in five, six years. Ev-eventually I stayed with this company for 15 years. Q: 15 years? A: 15 years I was working for them, and this is -- was sort again, it was like I was so -- was likely to be surrounded with nice people -- Q: Right, yeah. A: -- here. But really it is -- as a matter of fact, they did not fi re me when I here -- besides I went for the -- that I told you the -- how I had to get a signature from party -- party secretary, and how she -- she didn™t want to -- to give it to me for three weeks, and I could not apply without -- without his signature. Nobody -- nobody will take the paper from me. And I shil -- I toola -- I shiz, you know, I told him that I will call to committee of people rights, which did not exist. Q: Human rights, right, yeah. A: Human rights, which did not exist, but he didn™t know. He was mo re -- more drunk than -- than sober. That way he actually didn™t know what is going on, but it sounds -- you know, the committee of human rights sounds -- and I told him, okay, you don™t sign, I -- from your office, I™m calling to this, and I took receiver from his phone [indecipherable] right away. And this way -- this way I was able to -- to -- Q: To apply. A: To apply, yeah. Q: Right. A: Mm-hm. It is because he didn™t wanted th at to -- this, you know, this is not working people, this is not my comp -- my company, these people, but they were [indecipherable] Q: And you were able to leave in 1988?
