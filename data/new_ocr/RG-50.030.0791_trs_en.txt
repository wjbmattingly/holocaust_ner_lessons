Q: You mean the Bolshevik revolution? A: Bolshevik re Œ yes. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 24Q: Right.

And Œ and he was always in the middle, so I don™t know whether that™s the Œ was that something important for him? Q: Yeah. Was he the Œ was he the director of the jail, or was he just in charge of something? A: He was maybe Œ maybe Œ I don™t know, director, or Œ or Œ or somebody, you know, in may Œ maybe somebody more important, you know. Q: Okay. A: But I know he was getting good money an d Œ and Œ and it™s helped him to start in the farming, and Œ and whatever. And he was very smart man, because he knew how to start Œ start everything, and Œ Q: It sounds like he was very enterprising. A: Right, right, he was.

I remember that list ve Œ so, so well, you know, that Œ that he Œ that my mother came home and is Œ and she said she gonna go now to Œ to yskow , and she gonna ask the people to let Œ let him come home. But before that, he was taken to Wolkowysk Œ no, no, no, that was from yskow , they let him come beca-because my mother says there™s nobody to help me, and she had a little baby, and she was not healthy.

Q: And they didn™t want to do this work? A: Mm-hm. Q: Okay. A: And my father paid for it. That he Œ they were not free, you know, they Œ they were coming, and Œ and I ni Œ I saw my fa ther every time they Œ the people were working, he always ha d some money to give. Q: Okay. So the villagers in Krupa, their reason to sign the petition is that they didn™t want to do the work that needed to be done, and it was to let your father go so he could do it. A: Right, right. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 45Q: Okay. And the Œ and the people who let him go were local people, was that right? It was local people who arrested him, and local people who let him go? A: Parth Œ part of that Œ that group, that Byelorussian people.

A: So they Œ they were preparing Œ they knew probably what was Œ will come, and happen. Q: You think so, huh? A: I think so. Q: Okay. A: I think it was planned real well. Q: Your father is released, and he comes back and he moves the fish from the summer pond to the winter pond. A: Yeah, yeah, and Œ and that™s all the Œ in barns, and Œ and feeds the stock and Œ and all, you know, until Œ until he is arrested second time. Q: When was he Œ how was he arrested the second time, what happened? Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 47A: It was January fifth. Q: So three months had gone by? A: Mm-hm.

And so Œ so we see from the car comes out couple sol Œ Ru ssian soldiers, and Œ and with them comes that Jakowinski™s (ph) chauffeur. And that chauffeur was a relative of our neighbor. Our neighbor was married to a Byelorussian woman. Very nice woman, I have no bad word about her. And Œ and he comes and le ads those people, and tells them things, that my father was so and so, the bad one, you know. All the bad words that he could find. He di Œ he never saw my father before, or maybe saw because my father Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 48co Œ sometimes visited Jakowinski (ph). So Œ but that was Œ I Œ I Œ I Œ I don™t know why Œ why he did it, or, well, probably for his benefit. And Œ and Œ and they ask my father to show his pictures. So he, of c ourse, has taken the Œ not the family albums, he took the Œ his Œ from Œ from the jail, with all his friends, and the Œ and Œ and they started, you know, telling that my father was so bad, that my father was beating them, and Œ and Œ and things Œ things that I was listening, I Œ I don™t even remember any more.

And then they told my father, get dressed, put war Œ warm col Œ clothes on, and we™re taking you to the Wolkowysk to check how Œ how much truth you™re telling us. Q: So he was Œ he was sa ying no, I didn™t do these things, no, I™m not the way you™re accusing me, is that what the case was? A: I would say so. Q: Okay. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 49A: But Œ but then I Œ I Œ I just remembered, you know, that ho-how could they Œ I felt, you know, how can they say, when my fa ther is so nice, and he was so nice to them, you know? And so Œ so anyway, so Œ so Father get dressed, and then it came to say goodbye to him. It was last time for 11 years. Q: Oh my. A: And so Œ so we didn™t Œ we just hu gged him, you know. Of course, first time I saw him crying. I guess he knew. He knew that that™s the last time we see each other. And Œ and then comes our neighbor, th at Russian wife, Byelorussian wife of our neighbor.

Q: And Œ Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 60A: One only. They left Œ I think they left one only soldier. Q: Okay. And what about your brother, your older brother, what was he doing? A: I don™t know. They maybe kept him with the gun. I don™t know, did you remember? A2: Can I talk? Q: I think that let™s Œ A: I think Œ Q: Œ let™s hold on Œ A: Œ yeah. Q: Œ let™s cut for a second. A: Oh, okay. [tape break] Q: Okay, so it was this one young Russian soldier who was helping to pack up Œ A: Right. Q: Œ when Œ and when your mother so di stre Œ and you™re distracted, and so on. A: Okay. Q: And you were li Œ who lifted that big trunk onto the sleigh? A: They did. Q: Did they? A: Maybe my brother was helping. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 61Q: Okay. A: It could be that he was helping. I only took books. My mom said, take a book to teach Jereczek Polish. Q: Okay. A: Because when we get there, we will not leave that place, and ye Œ Jereczek had to le-learn Polish. Q: Polish. A: So Œ so I took a couple books. Q: Okay. A: And I took albums. Q: Photo albums? A: Photo albums. When they saw tha-that I Œ I am holding that, they took and Œ oh, and the s Œ oven was on to Œ to heat Œ Q: The house. A: Œ the house, because Œ and Œ and it was a fire there. Q: Okay. A: And he grabbed those albums and threw them in the fire. Q: Oh my. A: So I Œ I did Œ don™t have even a Œ a one picture of my mom, nothing. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 62Q: Oh my. Oh my. And did you take food? Did any Œ was there any food to take? A: They did some Œ they prepared some, th ey Œ they told us, oh you can take meat grinder, and kind of laughing, you know? They knew that Œ that there will be no Œ no meat to grind there. So Œ so my mother said no, I Œ I don™t want. She kind of sensed everything what was going on. Q: Okay, now once they™ve put this together, now explain to me why you had so much time. I wasn™t understanding that before. You said, you know, you were amongst the last to be picked up? A: Mm. Q: When you went outside, what kind of a vision did you see? What di Œ did you see many, many sleighs? A: Right. Q: With people? A: Right. Q: Okay. And why is that if you were the last to pick up Œ to be picked up, you had so much time? I would have thought th ey would give you less time, because everybody is waiting in those sleighs, and it™s cold outside. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 63A: I don™t know, I don™t know. Well Œ well anyway, I Œ I wanted also to take a Œ a picture of my patron, Saint Stanis aw Kostka . And Œ and it was made on a silk. So my mom told me, ta ke it off Œ out Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ and put it in your pocket. And I put it in my pocket, and down. Oh, and Œ and the clothes, they Œ they told us to put my father™s clothes, so they were dragging, you know, and whatever; but they were warm. So over our c-clothes, winter clothes, we still put my father™s Œ Q: Clothes. A: Œ clothes. Q: Okay. A: And so by Œ I Œ I always thought that about nine o™clock, we were already packed, because they would Œ whatever they would pack, they would take to the sled. And Œ Q: Did you have more Œ did you have more than one trunk? A: The trunk was at the end of the sle Œ sled, and then we Œ we had our seats there. Q: Okay. A: And Œ and they put the comforters for us to sit in, and so we wrapped ourselves. My mom didn™t know what to do, how to take baby. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 64Q: Yeah. A: So Œ so she took two pillows, and put Jereczek in between those and try to block the cold air and everything from him. So Œ so sh-she Œ she was saying, I don™t know if he will live. Maybe he™s choked, and everything. But somehow he survived. So Œ so when we were dri Œ I want to say driving Œ riding those sl eds, we got halfway only to station, to Wolkowysk . So they took us into the palace of Œ don™t remember already names. Q: Okay. A: I Œ I di Œ I should have prepared myself, but Œ Q: It™s okay. But it was a Œ a local palace. A: A local palace in one of the villages, halfway to Wolkowysk . Q: So it was like a large estate? A: Very. Q: Okay. A: And that was a Œ and they Œ they took all the sleds that were behind us, and Œ and us in there. And I remembered where I was sitting, because we couldn™t sl-sleep there. Q: Okay. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 65A: It was so many people, and I was sitting with my Œ my sister and my brother by the window. So when we came in, I went Œ I-I™m talking about my trip Œ I went straight to that place, and I said that™s Œ that™s where we were sitting. Q: Oh, that is when you Œ when you Œ A: Oh, that night. Q: Yeah. A: That night. We spend the night there. Q: So, you™re talking when you took a trip to your hometown many years later. A: Right. Q: That you found the pa lace, and Œ and you™ve Œ A: Found the pla Œ yes. Q: Œ you told them where you were sitting. A: And I remember when Œ I remembered everything vividly. Nothing Œ now I am losing memory, but when I was writing my book, I Œ I Œ I remembered everything as if I™m there now. Q: Yeah. A: So Œ so that™s very Œ Q: Was this Œ was this palace one of Polish nobility? A: Yes. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 66Q: So it had been Œ A: [indecipherable] they were arrested also, either killed, or Œ or Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ or like my father, taken to a gulag. Q: Okay. What was the manner of these Œ I mean, it sounds Œ it sounds actually, as rough as the soldier was, he was doing you a kindness Œ A: Yes. Q: Œ by Œ by helping pack things up. A: Yes, he was Œ he was very nice, and you know, children will sometimes hold the hands, and Œ and their hands are freezing, and whatever. When he saw my hands, he says Œ he started Œ you take your Œ that hand, and you kind of ro ll in between yours, and Œ to warm it up. Q: Really? A: And he Œ he did Œ he did that for me. And Œ and then my Œ my mom, you know, when our sled, on one Œ on the way back next day, s Œ fell over, and we ended up in the snow, he was helping us and Œ and it was Œ i-i Œ Russian soldiers, they have to be th-the way they Œ they are. They have to be in doing what Stalin told them. But some of them, they are forced to do that. Q: So you could tell th ey didn™t want to. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 67A: Right, right. So they Œ they had Œ and they Œ they had good people and bad people like everywhere else. Q: And was Œ was Œ were other soldiers like him who were Œ who were taking Œ I meant, those who came to take you, or was there manner in general Œ A: Right, it wasn™t like that. Q: Okay. A: They Œ when they left, that™s when he started. Because it came five of them, and then only one or two, I Œ I Œ that I don™t remember already. Q: Okay. A: So, I Œ I would have to read my book and maybe refresh. Q: That™s okay. But it Œ but it means that when he was left alone, and there was no one else to see him Œ A: Mm-hm. Q: Œ he could afford to be helpful. A: He showed Œ yeah, he showed his feeling for us, you know Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ what they were doing. Q: So, you stayed overnight there, near the window Œ A: Yeah. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 68Q: Œ in this palace? A: Mm-hm. Q: And what was the next day like? A: Next day they put Œ took us to this Œ the same sled, but there were things missing already. So somebody st ole some of the food. Q: Okay. A: And so whatever we took from the home, already wasn™t Œ wasn™t as much there as Œ as it was taken. So Œ but Œ Q: And then you say you™d continued the journey? A: Continued the journey to the train. Q: And where was the train? A: And th-the train was in Wolkowysk, at the station, not too far from my uncle. And my Œ my mom™s aunt. So Œ and in Œ on the way close to Wolkowysk, I saw a sled, a small sled, you know, and Œ coming with the horses real fast, and looking at us all the time. And the people. Not Œ not especially us, you know, but Œ but trying to identify. Q: Oh, I see. A: When they saw my mom, and us, they turned around. Q: Do you know who it was? Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 69A: It was my aunt and my uncle. No, my Œ I™m sorry, not my Œ that Œ she Œ that was my babcia. That™s my mom™s aunt. Oh, no, no, thank you, I have Œ Q: Okay, okay. A: And Œ and babcia, that™s the one that I Œ I was tal-talking about, that™s my Œ my mo Œ babcia , my mom™s ciocia. Q: Yeah. A: Okay. So Œ so they turned around, and they went back to Wolkowysk , because they Œ they knew where. Q: They knew that it was you. A: Yes. And then, apparently, Babcia watched all the time, which Œ which boxcar, because those were animal thi-things. And which Œ which one was the Œ the one that they pushed us in. So, after Œ after we got in, a Russian soldier came and naw Œ opened the door, and Œ and told Babcia to Œ to give what she had. She brought Œ Q: That™s unusual. A: Œ she brought so-some Œ how do you call? Tea, hot tea, and some sandwiches. And she wanted to take Irka(ph). And Irka(ph) was smaller, so Œ so she thought she can raise her. And Irk-Irka (ph) was holding so Œ so hard to my mom™s hand that Œ an-and they didn™t let her to be taken away. Q: So, she wouldn™t go? Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 70A: She wouldn™t go. Q: Okay. Would the soldier have let her go? A: Force her? No, no. Q: Not force her, but would she Œ if she had wanted to, do you think Œ A: I don™t know. I have no idea. Maybe he would. Q: What you describe sounds very unusual, that someone was allowed close enough to the train Œ A: Right. Q: Œ to give Œ to give water, or f ood, or tea, or something like that. A: Well, she spoke Russian. He possibly thought that she™s Russian, and she was [indecipherable] and whatever, Polish. So Œ and Œ and she was living there all her life. Because there Œ there were Polish and Œ and there were lithu Œ Lithuanian also Œ Q: Yeah. A: I™m sure. So Œ so that Œ and that is not unusual, but Œ but after she spoke Russian, she talk Œ he didn™t know, and he let her Œ Q: And he let her Œ A: Œ let her gaved whatever he brought Œ Q: She brought, yeah. What were the boxcars like? What did they look like? Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 71A: There was three levels, so when you get Œ got in, you couldn™t sit, you Œ you should Œ you could get in and Œ and just lay there, or Œ or sleep. And otherwise, you couldn™t sit in there. So it Œ Q: So who helped you put your trunk in the boxcar? A: They Œ whoever was, you know , I™m sure my brother was one. Q: Okay. A: And my brother was very Œ like in charge of ev-everything, so Œ so he watched. But as far as food, we didn™t have mu ch, because somebody stole. But Œ but my mom did little bit of this, you know. Q: But your mother was there with an infant, with a baby. A: Yes, and Œ and when we Œ we got there, she Œ she thought that she gon Œ he gonna have a real Œ a real red butt, because he wasn™t changed all day, and Œ and between the two pillows. So Œ but everything was okay. We took him all the way to Siberia. Q: And you had to change di apers on the lo Œ on the way. A: Yes. I don™t know how my mom Œ mom did that. Maybe she just Œ or if Œ if he Œ he Œ he was still milking my mom. At that time I don™t know if she had anything, but she Œ she had whatever she had, and otherwise I Œ I think she tried to substitute. He was Œ he was at that time, only from June to Œ about eight months old. So Œ Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 72Q: Did he cry? A: First he did, and I remember my mom said, when Œ when we were on the way, and he was about Œ between those pillows, she heard him cry. But then she says, oh, he Œ he quit crying. So maybe she Œ he is asleep. But then she says, or maybe he is not alive. So Œ so things Œ things we re Œ you know, everything wasn™t sure. Q: So wa Œ was she on a lower plank, or on an upper plank? A: They Œ they got us in between, so we Œ we had Œ so Œ so it was probably above the Œ the lower, an-and the Œ and the lower wer-were suitcases. And on this one was Œ I don™t Œ my hand is not good. Probably that wa Œ that high. And the Œ and the third one Œ the Œ the best was for the highes t people, but you know, men or Œ or Œ or somebody that is more quicker, not with baby, you know, they took those places, and we got, you know, some who are in between. So Œ Q: Why would they be the be st places, the ones on top? A: More air. It was Œ it was mo Œ more space. Q: Okay. A: And in between was Œ you had to breat he so Œ so the air was coming from here and there. Was kind of stuffy. But Œ Q: Did you know any of the ot her people in your boxcar? A: No. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 73Q: No. A: No, because when we were riding on a Œ with those sleds, our Œ our sled turned over, and then everybody went, so the neighbors from Œ from the Œ our osada, they went, and we stayed be Œ until they lifted the sled, and put us back into the sled. And then w Œ then we were coming with different Œ different people. Q: I see. A: So when they put us in Œ and there was 60 people in our boxcar. Q: Sixty. A: So 30 on one side, 30 on the other. Q: Were there other people who had babies? Were there more babies? A: Not in our boxcar. Q: Okay. A: Only Jereczek. Q: So what happen ed after that? You™re in the boxcar, what happens? A: Well then Œ then we waited, I think two days, by the time they apparently the whole Œ there was about hundred Œ hundred of those boxcars, full of deportees, and Œ and then Œ and then we started going. But they Œ in Œ in this area, between bra Œ no, between Œ oh my gos h, again no name. Well [indecipherable] next Œ next Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 74station when Œ when the large station, when they got us there, we had to wait for Baranowicze . Q: Baranowicze . A: I got it, Baranowicze . There they were changing the tracks from European width to the Russian. So we had to wait there until they finish. When they finished, it was like second day or third day, something like that. And then Œ then we had to carry everything from Œ from this one to Œ to the other one. Q: Oh, so you changed, actually, cattle cars. A: Right. And there, we had little more room Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ than Œ than on the Polish ones. So they had Œ then we got Œ also on the lower, but Œ but there wasn™t three of them, was Œ Q: It was two Œ A: Œ it was two. Q: Œ it was two platforms. A: Two Œ two platforms, yes. Q: I see. Okay. A: So Œ so it was a little Œ a little easier. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 75Q: And was it a Œ everybody from the firs Œ from the di Œ was it everybody who was in one boxcar then gets transferred to the same boxcar on the next train, or di Œ A: Probably Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ because they Œ they were keeping really soldiers were standing so nobody will run away. Q: Okay. A: So Œ so that™s Œ Q: So that Œ at that point did you know you were in the Soviet Union ? A: No, it wasn™t yet. Q: It wasn™t yet. A: Because Baranowicze Œ Q: Is still Poland. A: Œ is still Poland . So to the border was still quite a few miles Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ or kilometers. Q: So what happen ed after that, how did things go? A: Well, then Œ then we started rolling, once they packed us all. And we were Œ we were going fast, and people we re watching, you know, some of them, there™s Œ you Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 76know, there is about two Œ two windows on on e side, on Œ on top. So Œ so we were watching some of them. You know, if you were lucky, where is the Polish border? Q: Could they find it, could they see it? A: We saw, and Œ and they started singing [speaks Polish] and things like that, you know. Q: What are those? Are those Œ A: Hymn. Polish, and Œ and Œ and Œ and prayers, church Œ Q: Can you Œ would you mind si nging one of those so Œ hymns? A: [indecipherable] I will take. I think one of the very Œ very much loved is [Polish] Q: If that was being sung, then please, I would appreciate it. A: [sings in Polish] Q: And that was Œ A: That was Œ Q: Œ that was a hymn. A: Œ a hymn. That™s Œ that™s a church song. Pope Johns Paul the second loved that very much. Q: Oh yeah? A: That was Œ and Œ and Œ Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 77Q: And so the boxcar would just sing that Œ A: Singing all the Polish, one after the other, so Œ Q: How Œ how could you te ll Œ how could those who Œ A: Sorry my voice is Œ Q: I appreciate that you sang it. Thank you . How could you tell when you were pro Œ crossing the border, that this is Poland, and this is no longer Poland ? What looked different? A: And there were wires, how do you call those wires, with the Œ Q: Barbed wires? A: Yes. So Œ so that Œ that Œ Q: It was a barbed wire fence. A: Œ barb Œ barb wire fence, yet. Q: Were you near the window? A: I know I could see, so apparently people were nice enough to Œ to let children, you know Œ Q: Take a look. A: Œ climb up and Œ and take a look. Q: Okay. A: And we had to do it quickly. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 78Q: Of course. A: Just a Œ a look and Œ and that™s it. Q: Yeah. And then Œ A: And then the train was speeding so fa st, and maybe it wasn™t so much, but you just Œ you just see that it™s going away, and th Œ so fast, you know, so Œ so I Œ I just remember that, and Œ Q: Did you cry a lot? A: As a child, you Œ you don™t know so mu ch what™s happening. My mom Œ oh, my Œ our mom fainted. When the train Œ that was yet in Wolkowysk , when the train moved Œ Q: Okay, the first train, yeah. A: Œ the first Œ my Œ our mom fainted. And we cried and cried because we didn™t know what happened. I Œ I never saw my mother faint, you know, and Œ and all of a sudden, you know, she™s Œ I thought she died. And once Œ one lady, apparently she was maybe nurse, and she Œ she had smelling Œ Q: Salts. A: Œ salt Œ salts, and Œ and she do Œ did that to her [indecipherable] Q: So to bring her back. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 79A: To bring her back, yes. And Œ an-and then I Œ I don™t know if she fainted again, or Œ or not, but Œ Q: How did people behave with one another on that train, on that car? A: Oh, we were Œ we were like Œ we didn™t know each other, but Œ but we Œ we talked to each other like to your brother or sister, because that™s all Œ you are Œ you are sitting here and Œ and you™re Œ you™re going. Going to the same place, going from your home, a warm har Œ home. And Œ an-and I don™t know if you want to hear about conditions in that. Q: Yes. A: In Œ we didn™t have any toilets, of c ourse. The only thing, there was a hole in the floor, and Œ and nothing else. No Œ no co ver, no nothing, so Œ so how Œ how do you do that? Some Œ some people had extra bl ankets. They somehow managed to h Œ to hang it up, to Œ to cover Œ Q: Hide it. A: Œ make it private. So that was it. But, it was fro Œ freezing temperature. It didn™t take long until that hole was all fr-frozen, and no more hole. So the only way you could empty yourself, outside. So everybody, didn™t matter, a lady or Œ or Œ or a man, or Œ or Œ or who Œ the child, everybody had to go Œ Q: Outside. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 80A: Œ outside. And a Russian soldier woul d stand with a gun over you. Y-You open your Œ your panties [indecipherable] and it became, you know, everything Œ you have to go. But eventually when Œ when you didn™t eat so much, so you didn™t need to go so much. Q: So how often would th ey open the train doors? A: I think maybe twice a day. So Œ so th at was Œ and Œ and another thing was they gave you a loaf of bread the first day, and a bucket of water for Œ for all Œ for whole 60 people. Q: Oh my goodness. A: So Œ so we Œ we didn™t get much food, and of course that Œ that wasn™t en Œ and how much water did you get when you have a Œ a bucket of water? So Œ so you just get cup or someth ing, you know. Q: So people must have been hungry very quickly. A: Well, hungry and Œ but gradually your stomach gets Œ gets Œ Q: Adjusted? A: Œ adjusted to that, right. Q: Did anybody get sick on the train? A: Everybody. They Œ they were sick, they were dying. Q: There were de Œ people who were dying in your car? Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 81A: And babies Œ babies I™ve seen they threw out. They Œ you couldn™t carry it because it wouldn™t Œ and can you imagine the mother, losing a child? So Œ Q: Did this happen in your boxcar too? A: No. Luckily, in our boxcar there was no dead person. Q: Okay. But you saw in the other boxcars. A: But we saw through that little window, once in a while, you know. Or sometimes the door was opening, and they were ca rrying out from the other door. So they didn™t consider people as people. To them was like animal carrying the Œ I™ve seen so many dead, so many. Q: What happened where you got Œ when did you Œ wher e did you end up? Where did the train take you? A: It took us to a station Œ through vol Œ Moscow , Vologda, and at Vologda our train turned north towards Arkhangelsk. And on the way to Arkhangelsk , at the station that Œ I have it in my book, but not in my head, finally they stopped the train and si Œ told us to take our stuff out. They had, again, sleds waiting for us. They helped my Œ my brother, or probably one of the people was helping to Œ to put that trunk on. And Œ and us Œ and my sister and I and my mom, we were allowed to ride, but not my brother. My brother had to walk. Q: Your 15 year old brother. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 82A: My 15 years old brother. And he walked all way to Œ to Shilova. Every night we would stop in a village, Russian village, of the people that were also deportees from the first Œ from the revolution Œ Q: Really? A: Œ Russian revolution. And at one house a woman, when she saw my mom, she st Œ with the baby, she started crying. Appare ntly she had a baby too, and Œ when she was deported, and now Œ now Œ Q: She sees someone else. A: Œ she Œ she sees one and she Œ she star ted t-telling my mother Œ my mother spoke Russian, because she was through Œ through a couple, in German and Œ and Russian occupations. So to Œ to my mother, the la nguages were not strange. And Œ and then Œ then sh Œ we Œ I don™t know why she took us downstairs, but as we were walking downstairs, there was a little curtain, and she opened that, and she showed a Blessed Mother picture, and she says, I too believe in God. And didn™t Œ didn™t say much, because they are afraid, you know, their Œ they were afraid. So Œ so Œ so we slept there on the floor. They provided just floor b ecause that™s all they had, probably one bed for themselves, and Œ and nothing else. So that was our first night. Then s Œ then I think we Œ we had like four or five Œ they™re in the book. Q: Okay. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 83A: And Œ Q: How long did it take to get to Slishko(ph)? A: To Shilova ? Q: Shilova, excuse me. A: A week. Q: Okay. And your brothe r walked the whole time. A: And Œ and every da y he had to walk. Q: And what about yo ur baby brother, your Œ the other brother? A: The Œ the baby brother was okay yet, and my mom Œ but he had very clean Œ she probably had enough powder or whatever, y ou know, to Œ to help him to heal and Œ but that™s Œ that™s all she ca Œ she could do. But that woman was very helpful. Well, I guess we Œ we met a lot of people on th e way, good people. I cannot Œ cannot complain. There were bad people, but thos e not necessarily were Russians. They could be Polish. Because when they stole something, I don™t think the Russian would carry, because Œ although, who knows? I don™t know. Q: So did this lady Œ did this lady have food to give you as well, or Œ A: Just kipiatok . Q: And what™s kipiatok? Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 84A: Just hot water. And they Œ they all had ra Œ rationing, so we Œ we Œ we couldn™t expect and Œ or if Œ if the government gave them something, you know, but otherwise Œ and like they appar Œ apparently expected that we did take enough food, you know, for that. Q: So when you get to Shilova, what is Œ what did you find there? A: They put us in one room, two families. And the room was maybe a Œ like this living room to Œ til Œ to here. From there maybe it™s even Œ this is ba Œ bigger. And Œ and one side was boards, and nothing else, no mattresses, no nothing, for one family, and the other si-side boards also sta Œ you know, it™s like a table, and Œ and Œ Q: So was it like a room that would be 10 by 10? Ten feet by te n feet, or Œ about half the size of this living room? A: Yeah, that™s Œ that™s all, only Œ only that much. Q: Okay. A: And there was one table, small table in the middle, by the window. And two Œ two chairs, but not real chairs like we have, the one with the back. Q: Right. A: So Œ and Œ and then there was one small bed yet, a real Œ real bed. That Œ that one was my s Œ my brothers™. So four of us in Œ in one, across, because otherwise Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 85would be not enough room for Œ for Œ for us. So Œ so we did across, legs Œ legs probably my Mom™s were falling Œ showi ng. And Œ and the same, the other family was three children and the father and mother. So Œ Q: So five people on one, and five in the other. A: Yeah. Q: Ten people in this small room. A: In this small room, and one stove, and one of those, like many, many years ago, when there was no electric type stoves, or Œ or electric whatever, you know, it™s Œ it™s very primitive.

Cutting tr-trees, trimming branches on them, and Œ a-and putting them in a Œ a mound that they were told that that™s how it sh Œ the m easurements have to be, the Œ the length of it, and Œ and Œ and so much high Œ height, and Œ and so Œ so that™s what my brother was supposed to Œ and I Œ I didn™t know until I read my brother™s report when he Œ when he was getting into the army, Polish army. So Œ so at that time, he wrote that he was not getting enough food, and they were cutting, and that™s why he was getting sick being there. Q: So that meant your Œ your older brother was working as an adu lt, even though he was 15 years old. A: Mm-hm. Q: And was his ration, his food, for the whole family? A: No, that was for him. Q: Okay. A: But only as much Œ Q: As he worked. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 87A: Œ as each person should get it. Q: And so they said he didn™t me Œ ma Œ meet his quota Œ A: So Œ Q: Œ and so he would get less food. A: Right, right. Q: And the Œ I mean, it sounds like the cards were stacked against him, because he was a boy to begin with Œ A: Right, right. Q: Œ to have to do an adult job. A: Mm-hm.

Well, when we interview you, then we will Œ we will get that then. A2: Okay. Q: But I would say that it™s probably if you were taken on February 10 th, you know, and you spent some days until you cross the border from Poland into the Soviet Union , probably sometime in Œ at the end of the month, or the beginning of March is when you arrived there. I™m just esti mating. So your brother is taken, and you don™t see him at least until May first. A: Right. Q: Okay. And when he came Œ A: Until he got sick. Q: So what did he get sick from? A: A nutri Œ nutrition. Q: A lack of nutrition. A: Less of nutrition. Q: What was his disease? Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 89A: First time was he couldn™t see. He Œ hi Œ he lost the vision at night. So, they sent him home, and he came with a raw liver. Because on Siberia we didn™t see them eat. Q: Okay. A: But when somebody is si ck and couldn™t work, then they found it. And Œ and he Œ he came with that, and my mother was chopping it and trying to make it Œ no Œ no onion, no Œ no spices. Maybe she had some little salt or something. So Œ so she would prepare that for him, and Œ and he had to eat. A nd my sister knows what the Œ what Œ how it tastes because she ha d Œ she had the problem in her life. Q: Okay. Now, in Œ what did the rest of you do? A: Before my si Œ my brother and that one date before, when he headed home, he showed me how to cut the trees Œ tree down. Q: Okay. A: And which tree to cut. Which tree is dry, dead.

Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 90A: Œ or more things that they gave us to take from home, our sled that we were playing with. Q: So you could bring a sled? A: So we could bring the sled, just was Œ it wasn™t big. It was probably that big. It was ours to Œ for down Œ downhill. Q: Okay. A: And that thing came Œ came in so handy, because we took that sled, and we went to Œ to the Œ where the bog is, but in the wintertime it™s frozen. And there are the trees that are dead. So we cut those trees, one by one, and were carrying home. So my brother helped me to prepare that foo Œ that wood, and Œ and we Œ and I learned how to do it. Q: Okay. A: So then, next day, my si ster, I took her with me, okay, we are going. Because to cut the tree, we had one Œ one long saw that you have to pull on each side, so Œ so she was on one side, I was on the other. We cut it, and then I did everything what my brother taught me, and we star ted wa Œ bringing the f Œ the wood. Q: So you would at least have heat for the house. A: Heat and Œ and cooking. Q: And what about the other fami ly, did they do the same thing? Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 91A: I always think, you know, they used our wood. Because there was two boys, and one boy was my brother™s Œ Q: Age. A: Œ age, so he went to work in a forest. Q: Okay. A: But the other one stayed here. Q: Okay. A: And Œ and they Œ I don™t remember i Œ them bringing any Œ any wood. Q: Did they contribute in any way? A: I Œ I don™t remember. Q: Okay. Okay. A: I don™t remember.

A: She was not well, and each time Œ and Œ and also, she was getting migraine. I am blessed with them. Q: Oh, oh. A: Today Œ today I had to take pills. Q: Oh, what a p ity, what a pity. A: That™s okay, I forgive my mom. Q: Oh. So she was not well, and you and your sister would go and get the wood. A: Mm-hm. Q: Did you have any other duties that you had to do? A: Eventually we went to school. Q: Okay. A: I™ll Œ but when we went to school, it was morning hours. And then in afternoon, we got the job. We could work and make some money. So it was a [indecipherable] which, cubic meters. Q: A cubic meter, yeah. A: Cubic meter, and we had to cut the wood a certain am Œ Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 93Q: Length. A: Œ length, and make it until it reaches the Œ the requirement. Q: Okay. A: And then we got something like maybe one ruble, or something for it. Q: Okay. A: I know it wasn™t much, but it was helping my brother. Q: Yeah. A: Because whatever he was giving us was enough only to buy bread. So Œ so but we sa Œ somehow we survived. Q: Were you selling some of the items from the trunk? A: Yes. We Œ we were going to Russian people, those that were previously deported. And the village was on the other side of the lake. Q: Okay. A: In the wintertime the lake froze, so we could get there. But no boats or anything that could take us across. Q: Okay. A: Some Œ some of the women from the other side sometimes would come here. And I remember my mom had a sweater, like a Œ a wool for knitting. And she didn™t Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 94know how to knit, and I didn™t learn beca use I didn™t want to learn, because the village people were Œ were doing that. So I Œ Q: Oh really? A: Œ oh, this Œ I Œ I had s-some kind of st upid pride. And so Œ so when my mother was selling that, she says, see, you could have make a nice sweater for yourself, and now you don™t know how. Q: Yeah. A: And would you believe, I Œ I took the needles [indecipherable] and I Œ and I knew it. Q: You learned how? A: The only Œ by myself this time. B ecause that women that was teaching me, apparently she showed me enough that I me morized. I wasn™t that stupid, like now. Q: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Very good, very good. So that you Œ you sold the sweater to Œ A: To the Œ Q: Œ to the villagers over in the Œ A: Yeah. And they gave you more when it was ne Œ new. So Œ but it wasn™t that much, you know, that wasn™t Œ I don™t know, maybe two sweaters or something. But things like that, you know, and they gave us a lot of those, in the Œ in the trunk, Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 95you know, the Œ those things, pillowcases and Œ and so Œ so all that, you know, helped us. Except at the end we already at the end of our stay there, it wasn™t enough to do exchanging or Œ because we Œ we would ask for th e bread, gave us loaf, you know. Okay, I will give you Œ give you this. I mean, it™s Œ it™s that kind of, you know, business. Q: That kind of bartering. A: Bartering, yeah. Q: Yeah, yeah. A: So Œ so we Œ we did that, you know, and Œ and Œ and then in the summertime, we did have berries. Q: Okay. A: Especially cranberries. The only problem was, you had to go into a bog. Q: A bog, oh. A: And Œ and Œ and there was ice yet floating on top, so the water was Œ Q: Cold. A: Œ cold. And I™m Œ I am Œ I started getting some kind of sores on my legs. So apparently from cold Œ Q: Yeah. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 96A: Œ cold water. But Œ but we went couple times with Irka (ph) to Œ to pick, and we were selling, and Œ Q: The cranberries? A: Œ cranberries, yeah. And also, we could Œ they Œ they pr ovided for us, a barrel. In that barrel you could preserve those blue berry Œ n-no, cranberries. And Œ and they would provide some food, and of course vitamins. So Œ so we saved for us, and then selled what Œ sold what was too much for us. And Œ and then get couple, and some Œ and for that extra money, we would ma-make Œ buy soup. Because they were providing fish soup. They called it uha(ph). Q: Uha(ph). A: So, the [indecipherable] . Q: How is Œ how is your brother doing, your little brother? A: He didn™t last too long. Q: What happened? A: There was no Œ no food for baby. My mom would Œ would Œ I Œ I remember was chewing that bread, and Œ and giving them chewed up, you know, it™s Œ she would never do that, but that™s the on-only way the baby could Œ because he was Œ Q: Digest it, yeah. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 97A: Yeah, he wasn™t even a year old. So, at Œ he was getting sick all the time. She didn™t have any Œ she was so Œ so slim.

Q: So, he last Œ A: Forty Œ wait a minute, ™40, yeah. Q: 1940. So he lasted maybe five months. February, March Œ A: Oh, wait a minute. Q: Œ April, May Œ A: No, no, no, that was Œ Q: Œ June.

[crying] He was a Œ like our ba Œ doll. We played with him, we did eveverything with him. My mom didn™t ha ve to do not Œ not much. We both, Irka(ph) and I, we took care of him. She did only ch ange the diapers or something like that, but otherwise, we were Œ Q: You were taking care. A: It was our Œ our baby. Q: Was it in the daytime? A: He was dying, and Œ and people were so Œ so helpful. Whoever had somebody dying, you know, they would come and they would pray. They would try to Œ to help my mom, you know. And Œ and they even make Œ made a coffin for him, a little white, you know, and Œ but I Œ I couldn™t Œ I couldn™t accept [indecipherable] crying and praying God that he would live. I think it Œ this Œ that was the most painful thing in my life because I couldn™t understand what Œ what is happening, I couldn™t understand why it™s happening, you know, it Œ Q: And he was so innocent, he™s a baby. He™s a baby. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 100A: Yeah. All the babies in the camp died. Eight hundred people were there, and only one survived. Q: Only one baby? A: But that pe Œ pe Œ person Œ that fam ily was privileged for some reason. I don™t want to talk about it, but Œ but there were people that were trying to give some others that maybe had some Œ something wron g, or Œ I ŒI Œ I really don™t know why Œ why that f-family was giving out some other people. Q: You mean they were informing on other people? A: Informing, yeah. And they Œ and they Œ every day they could get a glass of milk for that baby. My mother Œ of course we Œ we saw, because the Œ we have windows and we see, you know, people wa Œ people walking in front. And so when uri -- Jereczek was so much Œ so sick, she would go to Œ to that pryncidacin(ph) and ask him. He was the only one that had a cow. He was Œ he was in charge of the camp. And so my mom went, and I remember she ca me with the glass of milk, gave Œ and gave him that, you know, what™s glass of milk, you know, just Œ but, better than nothing. And Œ and that was the last glass that he Œ that he had. Q: So it was Œ A: The only glass. Q: The only glass. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 101A: But there was no meat, no Œ no nothing . Bread and water. And our family didn™t Œ didn™t have money, and we just exchan ged our clothes for Œ for food, for bread, for potatoes. Potatoes they had the lot. So Œ so we could get. Once my mother said, I will go, because she felt sorry for us, but I don™t know how many time Œ times Irka(ph) went, but I went once with a couple lady friends, and they took me with, and I exchanged fo-for Œ for po tatoes, so that was okay. I Œ I took the sled with me, and put the bag on it, bu Œ and nothing happened. But when my mom went, for some reason, they froze. Maybe she was resting too much, and maybe laying down on Œ on ice, or something. So Œ Q: You know something, we™ll break for a minute. A: Okay. Q: I™m going to make a phone call, and then we™ll continue until lunchtime, okay? A: Okay. [break] Q: We™re Œ we™re talking again. A: Oh, oh, we™re talking. Q: We™re talking again. A: Uh-oh.

Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 102A: For me that was very Œ I never forget that. I still remember grave of Jereczek. Q: Oh, really? A: Irka(ph) and I, we made a fence around. Can you imagine, two little girls? We dug f Œ to put the Œ Q: Coffin in? A: Œ posts Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ into. We figured out how to put the Œ around the grave, and Œ and we Œ we made Œ put the grass on the Œ and planted some wildflowers, because we tried to plant Œ our babcia that sent from Wolkowysk those flowers, seeds that she send us. And they didn™t want to grow. But we did plant and Œ and found out that they don™t grow. But to us Œ Q: Where did Œ where was Œ where was his grave in the compound? A: There Œ there was a Œ a cemetery, because those Russian people , when they were deported, they were dying out. So there were some graves, but those graves, some of them had crosses, some of them alre ady Œ because it was 20 years, and the only thing there was is a wooden cross. Q: Did your brother have a wooden cross? A: Yes. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 103Q: Were you able to put his name on it? A: It™s the Œ Q: Not really, huh?

From the flowers, you make the circ Œ Q: A wreath? A: A reef. Q: A wreath. A: A reef, yes. Q: Okay. A: Little reefs on it, you know. And Œ or Œ or put just bouquet o-of flowers on the grave. We Œ we a Œ if not every day, th en every second day we would go to his grave. And the Œ it was Œ we kept that as a Œ as our part of responsibility.

And Œ and she just took scissors, and Œ and he says, oh just cut there. And I didn™t know how to cut, you know, so I took Œ I think she had ma de into a one Œ one of those braids. A braid, and Œ and she just took that braid, cut here. And she didn™t care, because she Œ Q: Because the weight of the hair was hurting her? A: Yeah, that™s what she thought, that the weight of the hair is causing her Œ but, you know, it didn™t help. And she would Œ tie a scarf on her head tight, do it tight, you know, and oh sh e Œ she suffered. Q: She was suffering. A: And with migraine, I know if I wouldn™t take the pill, those that are helping Œ one lady in Joole(ph) told me what to take, and Œ and it™s cheap, and Œ and I can get at Walmart . But oth-otherwise, I don™t know what I would do, because doctors always try something that they think it helps. Not everyone helps. But now Œ now I Œ I always take that aceen Œ aceenominophen (ph). Q: But you know, for a person who was in the situation that your mother was in, and that other people were in, not everyb ody who got deported was in the best of Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 105health, or their health got broken in different ways along the journey, or on the journey, or in the place. And how do you take care of that, how do you recover, you know, when there is Œ when you™re in such a Œ you know, if someone gets sick, or if someone has cancer, or someone Œ you know. A: Well, th Œ over there, there was an Œ nobody knew about cancer, period, and Œ and Œ and those were not old ladies. There were Œ ther e were some pu Œ people that were deported with the Œ grandmothers. A nd Œ but those grandmot hers were taken, and they said, we™re taking them to the place that when they Œ where they get better, and they apparently poisoned them, becau se no-nobody s-saw one of them.

But lucky mi Œ my mom was just 43, or some Œ between 43 and 45. So she was a young person.

And only some pl aces became bogs, and those bogs then destroyed that Œ the trees. So those are the ones that I and Irka(ph) were Œ we were looking for Œ Q: What about Œ A: Œ to cut down, because they were lighter to begin with. Q: Right. A: And Œ and ready to be put into fire. Q: What Œ what did the Œ how many build ings were there to house these 800 people? A: Ah, I don™t remember exactly, but pr obably eight. And each building Œ the one that we were, were eight of those rooms Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ for some families Œ there were some families like eight people in one, so they got the ha Œ one room. But since our was on ly five, and a baby, so apparently they didn™t count, or they didn™t think that he will live. And us stayed with two families in one. Q: So it would be like eight large build ings and maybe eight to 10 rooms per building, and about 10 people per room, something like that. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 108A: Something like that, and Œ and some mo re, because Œ because they were a large family. Q: And you said one family got special tr eatment because they informed on others. A: Mm-hm, yeah. Q: So what kind of things could they inform on? A: People would, after work would meet and talk, you know, what would be, what Œ for instance we Œ we were sitting at the table, and Œ and that was making Œ I don™t remember exactly, but that Œ whatever we were using, we would put finger on it, and that thing would be energized, and go from Œ and we woul d ask, and Œ and it would spell wha Œ Q: Like a Ouija board. A: Ouija board. And Œ and you know, that kept us going, because we believed that that thing tells us the Œ the truth. Q: I see. So they would report on these kinds of activities. A: Yes. Q: Okay. A: And Œ or, we would Œ on Sundays, we would get together into one room and pray. Q: Was there a priest in Œ amongst the 800? Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 109A: Not Œ not in our Œ not that we knew. Q: Okay. A: Not in our camp. I™m Œ I know there were Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ but not in our camp. Q: And you said that every baby that came to that ca mp died, except one. Were there other people who were dying in the camp? A: Yes, yes. Oh, I have to tell you that one. My brother worked in the summer. Whatever tree, or Œ or those woods they were cutting, now, when the lake Œ Q: Wasn™t frozen. A: Œ wasn™t frozen, then they took that Œ that circle, because they were throwing into water Œ and Œ and into Œ inside of the circle, and were Œ with a special Œ I have it in my book. Q: Was it a special instrument of some kind? A: Special thing, primitive, but they made it, and then they could pull, they Œ on Œ on the shore. They could turn that. And that was moving the Œ the wood towards the opening in the lake where the river starts. In Œ and then they, on a river, they wa Œ they go on a shore walk. And Œ and they watch where there is like a turn, and at the turn, and the Œ the wood gets stuck. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 110Q: So they would try and gu ide the logs from the water Œ A: To Œ right. Q: Œ from the lake to the river. A: Œ to the oma Œ to the Onega river, because this one™s smaller, Kosh (ph) river, and that I remember. And Œ and to the ome Œ Onega Œ Q: Omega ? A: Onega , Onega. Q: Onega . A: Onega river. Q: Onega river, okay. A: And then Œ and then they let it go, wherever Œ wherever some Œ something else takes over. So my brother and in a group of those men, was Œ and there was another young boy. I™m sure there was couple Œ coup le of them. That one was fourth grade high school, and my brother was only second grade. So Œ Q: Second year of high school. A: Second year of high school. So Œ so my Œ my brother was in a boat with the young men Œ young boys. And Œ and my Œ and his friend was sitting on the same bench, but he™s on this side, and Œ and Œ and Urich(ph) on the other side. So when Œ when they came to the [indecipherable] waterfall, then they Œ the Russian, Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 111whoever was in charge of that group, sa id that they have to go down on the waterfall. Q: They have to go down the waterfall. A: On the waterfall, with the boats. So the old man, I guess more knowing how to Œ how Œ how to operate that, you know, water and the Œ and the boat.

So my mom se nt us to the post office. We Œ we had to go, I don™t know, maybe eight kilometers to Œ to the main aw Œ post office, to pick up the letter. And we got the letter and we come home and Œ and Œ and I look at this, and this is from Uncle Joseph from Moscow. So Œ so Œ and of course when Mama opened this and Œ and si Œ found 3 00 rubles, that was all that we needed. Q: Oh my. So that helped, that helped. A: So that yes, that helped us. Hundred Œ hundred thou Œ thou Œ rubles for each person Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ on the Œ on the train. But not on Œ on the sled.

And we said Mama we Œ don™t worry, we will walk, we will walk, and Œ because she was worried that Œ and doesn™t have enough to pay. Well, first Œ first distance was from our camp to Polwina(ph) which was part of Œ half to Œ to the next village, an-and that™s why the name Polwina(ph), halfway.

A: See, at that point my mom didn™t sell her hat, an-and the Œ and other s Œ other beautiful things that I remember seeing and admiring it, you know . But at that point we Œ we had only that much how to pay. And she, of course, she would never make it. Q: Yeah. A: The Œ the way sh Œ when she was walking [indecipherable] sometimes, and not always. When she felt little better. So Œ so at that time, we walked, and when we got to the end, I think Irka(ph) was so Œ i-in such a pain Œ she is a very tough little Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 127child when she was little, and now too. She Œ what she has, I Œ I think I would be dead long time ago. Q: Okay. A: Exercises, and all.

So Œ so she took my prettiest skirt that I liked so much, you know, with those pleats all around, and I never forgot. Forgave her, but Œ but f Œ didn™t forget. And at that time my Œ of course, I Œ I didn™t Œ she didn™t ask me, and I would always allow. But Irka(ph) all the way, hardly ke Œ could wa lk. And Œ but I walked all the way. My Œ my le Œ feet would Œ would be Œ Q: Took you the whole way. A: Œ okay. Q: And so what kind of a di stance are we talking about? A: Hundred twenty kilometers to the station. Q: So that™s a good Œ almost a hundred miles. A: Kilometers Q: I know, 120 kilometers Œ Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 128A: Mm-hm, it™s a hundred miles. Q: Hundred miles. A: Œ yeah. So Œ so Œ Q: That™s huge. A: Œ I did. I did. And I guess my legs are okay, because I don™t even have big veins. Irka(ph) has u Œ they Œ her veins are like my finger. Q: Wow. A: You can see that. Q: So Œ A: So Œ so that was Œ Q: And Œ and then you were able to buy tickets on the train? A: Yes. Yes, because my mom sold that hat, and Œ and some Œ and that was shawl that she Œ and that I admired, I always looked at it and then, you know, girls Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ like some pretty things. So Œ so it was Œ it was really good preparation. And then Œ then as we Œ as we were driving by the open Œ this boxcar, then was open there, and Œ and one of the gentleman from the Œ from the camp was there. And Œ and he says, come on into our Œ they still needed some more people. Q: So you had Œ you had an open boxcar now? Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 129A: Yeah. Q: No Œ not a Œ A: Yeah, now Œ now we are free. So it Œ so it was a Œ a open thing, and waiting for us. We could close the door when we want ed, we could do anything that we wanted. Q: So Œ but it was the same set-up as before, with the planks. A: Right. Q: Okay. A: But only two. Q: Only two. A: Only two, so Œ so it was more Œ more room for us, and Œ an-and we went Œ we went in the top. And on the top, that man, he was helping us a lot. Q: Okay. A: As we were going, I will tell you Œ will we finish until I get to Mexico? Q: Yes. Oh, we can talk about it now if you want to, or was Œ he was helping you in Mexico? A: Oh, no, no, this is not in Mexico . This is when we were going south Œ Q: Yes. A: Œ already without my mom. Q: Oh, he helps you there? Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 130A: We Œ we left Œ on the first station, Irka(ph) and I were looking for Mom. We were running at the station on one side. Q: Okay, no then Œ no, let™s get a little Œ A: Back up? Q: Yeah. A: Okay. Q: Because otherwise I Œ I might not understand. A: Okay. Q: So you™re in this boxcar, and ther e™s a gentleman there from your camp, who sees you and says come on in, and he helps you. A: Mm-hm. Q: And you get the top platform, the top bunk where it™s a little bit more air. A: Mm, okay. Q: And you™re proceeding south. A: Mm-hm. Q: And then what happens? A: And then at one Œ at one of th e s-stations, one pe rson catches a dog. Q: Okay. A: And Œ and they murder the dog, and Œ Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 131Q: Food. A: Œ cook Œ cook and smelling this Œ it™s the worst Œ worst meat if you want to cook the dog. Well, anyway Œ and when the Œ one skin, when they too Œ pulled off the skin from him, they wanted to throw away. And the woma n that had two little girls, they look more like twins or anything, and Œ and Œ and sh e was kind of not too Œ too able to provide Œ Q: Food. A: Œ or save for them, because they were overpowering her or something, that she Œ she didn™t have nothing. My mom would ha ve at least a spoon of something, and then she would divide that spoon among us. Usually not herself, she wouldn™t include. So Œ so she Œ that woman takes th at skin, burns the hair Œ you can imagine burning hair in a Œ in a Œ Q: Cattle car, yeah. A: Œ traveling Œ Q: Right. A: Œ train. And Œ and then she cooked that . And she cooked that skin for probably hours. And there was a stink and Œ and whatever. You know, it™s Œ it was just unbearable, but Œ but poor children were hu ngry and that™s all she could provide. Possibly she was with my mom, you know, to go to buy that food, and the train left Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 132and she didn™t go because they were sayi ng, and she listened. And our mom said no, I cannot feed you, I Œ I ha ve to go. So Œ so Œ Q: Oh, so you stopped at a train stop. You stopped at a railway station. A: Yes, following. Q: Mm-hm. Following after this incident. A: Yes. And then Œ and then we g Œ jumped out, opened the door because we were in charge of doors and everything. So Œ so we opened the door and started running at the station and calling, Mamushu (ph), Mamushu (ph). But Mamushi (ph) was not on one side, so Œ so we went for the ot her side. And on the other side we did the same and Œ and Œ and then we see the trai n, the wheels are moving. And I said to Irka(ph), let™s Œ let™s go on the other side. And I™m telling you that I think God was protected us because the train was already moving and we managed to go on the other side. Q: You mean by the other side, you™ve ma naged to get into the car from the other side? A: The Œ only from that side the door was. Q: Okay. A: So Œ so w-we Œ we climbed underneath and started running towards the front, because we went til Œ Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 133Q: Oh, I see. A: Œ til now to the back. So we were running, and Œ and here is the door opened, and Œ and Mr. whatever stands in the door and come on, give me hand, give me hand. And Œ and he pulls us what Œ with arm, one arm and Œ and the Œ I guess he was pulling so fast that Œ that Œ and we were light, we were still hungry and Œ and Œ and Œ and skinny. So Œ so he pulled us in. And he f Œ Q: And do you remember the train st ation, what the name of it was? A: Maybe in the book. Q: Okay. A: Because I Œ I don™t remember, at this point. Q: Was this very far into the journey, close to the beginning Œ A: Oh yes, yes. Q: Œ or close to the end? A: That was whole day, as we started at Œ at noon Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ the train was speeding. Q: Okay. A: Speeding and speeding and speeding. And just stopped at the pi Œ or stopped or didn™t stop, or just whistled woo-ooo and go and go and go, until we passed, I think Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 134Ural mountains. So, from Vologda to Œ to the Ural mountains, and then Œ and then he stops. Apparently he tried as fast and as farthest to get because Germans are Œ airplanes are flying. And if they saw the Œ I think that during the day they could go. At night, train Œ the airplanes would Œ would be bombar Œ bombarding the train. So anyway Œ so we Œ we are at the Œ at the train, and Œ and Œ and another day, but Œ but was stopping more often. So whatever sta tion we would Œ we would come out and call Mamo, Mamo, Mama, you know, an d Œ and Œ and nobody Œ nobody Œ Q: So you had been on the train for one whole day when it stopped at a station, your mother left to buy food, and didn™t return before the train left.

Q: Okay. Okay. A: And then Œ and then we Œ the whole Œ whole day and night, and Œ and Œ kept on going, we were going for a certain time that I don™t remember. And finally we got to the southern state, but now it™s a different country, Kirghizia . Q: Ah, Kyrgyzstan . Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 135A: Kyrgyzstan . And they™re separate now. So Œ and there was, in Jalabad(ph), was Polish army already.

Q: So how long did Œ yeah, how long did the trip from Vologda to Jalabad (ph) last? A: Probably about three Œ three weeks, or something like that. Q: And you lost your mother on the first day? A: No, week. We were traveling from the first station to Vologda for a week. Q: Okay. A: Over there we were traveling only duri ng the day, and at night would be standing in a secluded area.

Q: Oh, so two week s from Œ so it was Œ A: Two weeks, yes. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 136Q: Okay. A: So Œ so there, every day, they would be telling us, we will leave today. We will leave today and Œ and Œ and we started going, and whatever. So for a whole week my mom was always living with that nervou s, oh, I™m going for br ead, or Œ or Œ or my daughter is going for Œ because which she would send Irka(ph) and me, and whatever Œ whichever felt little better. So Œ so we Œ we were constantly separated, and Œ and she was nervous ab out losing us. And then Œ then finally her system couldn™t hold it, and Œ and she says, we Œ we don™t have nothing to eat, so Œ so she is going. And she didn™t even listen to us, what we Œ now, of course, which mother listens to a child? So Œ so anyway, after Œ wait, what did I want to say? Q: In Vologda Œ A: Okay. Q: Œ you had to wait a week. A: Yes. Q: But you were already on the boxcar. A: Oh we Œ we were in the same boxcar that we paid in Œ in Œ in the first station.

And at Œ that day an Œ day, b ecause each day they were saying that we will leave, we will leave, you know, at noon, or in the evening, and this. And then, at that day, they se Œ they were saying the same thing. And a Œ I don™t know, Irka(ph) or Œ or I was Œ I think Irka(ph) probably, was for the bread. And she come back. Maybe she ti Œ she™ll tell you Œ Q: Okay, yeah. A: Œ straighten me out. And Œ a nd whoever was there, came back. Q: Okay. A: So Œ so then my mom decided she will go. And Œ and she did go. And we were crying, we were asking her and didn™t work. So Œ Q: And you never saw her again. A: And Œ and it was like 12 o™clock Œ five Œ five minutes after t Œ after Œ after 12 o™clock, the train starts moving. And then you can imagine both of us just couldn™t Œ couldn™t Œ Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 138Q: It wa Œ and it™s Œ it™s what one has heard before, that very often the trains would stop, and one of the family members would get out to get something, and then they™d be left behind. A: Yeah. But some of them catch up, and some don™t have luck. They couldn™t find out Œ see, that was war, you know. They probably left when there was something Œ they got probably clear from Œ from somebody. So Œ so that was not a pr Œ on purpose for leave those, or leave that, you know, it was just happened. And Œ wait, what else? Oh, and we were Œ when we were going down, and probably the first longer stop for us was at the place that was Polish Œ Polish Œ oh my gosh, I knew all those names and ev Œ whatever. Where Œ Polish government small office was there. And so I went to report that we lost our mother, that Mother stayed in Vologda , and gave the names, mine Œ Irka™s(ph) and mine, and we neve r heard of that, you know, that anybody reported anything, you know. So she didn™t get that far. Q: Did she have the money, or did you have any money? A: She had the money. She ha d nice fur lined coat that was very warm. And Œ and she had our I.D., because without I.D. you couldn™t get Œ buy the bread. So Œ so my Œ my suspicion is that Œ oh, and another thing I have to tell you. Years later, when we arrived in Mexico , in our or-orphanage were two little sisters of the boy that in Vologda jumped out of that train, and to bring his father and Œ and the rest of the Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 139group back to the Œ he Œ he thought that he will make it, and they will be able to get on the train. But it didn™t happen. He stayed with the father, father died. And Œ and our mother was on a Œ he said on a breck(ph). What is breck(ph)? I tried Russia Œ Russian people, I tried Jewish people, I tr ied anybody I could imagine, if any knows what is breck(ph)? Q: Yeah, what is a breck(ph)? A: The only thing I can imagine, it was a platform, maybe with some si-sides, or maybe nothing. And Œ and they were on that breck(ph) with whatever they had on, and with the wind, when train was going so fast, they would never survive if they were standing on. So all people, like flies were freezing and falling off. And Œ and somebody found my mother frozen, dead. And Œ and she Œ and Œ and she had all these clothes on, all her documents. She sa w, on my mother™s document there is two little girls. She would get three portions of bread at the store, not one, and Œ and she was probably only one, and she threw her clothes off, or just Œ just Œ no, she probably ki Œ kept a Œ a coat. An d Œ and Œ and she took my mother™s I.D. Q: So Œ so you Œ you Œ you think this is what happened? A: Right, because exactly everything the same, except Œ except only thing, where is she from? And she was from Saint Petersburg. So at that time people were running away from the war. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 140Q: Okay, so in other words, you find out la ter, in later years, that there™s a woman who Œ A: In 1999, I think, because already my Œ my book was published. Q: Okay, so in 1999, you find out that there was somebody from Saint Petersburg who had the same documents as your mother? A: Right. Q: Did you know this person™s real name? A: No, it didn™t show, just that Œ that she Œ she traveled from Saint Petersburg. Everything was the same except instead of from Arhanga (ph) Skyoblish(ph), or from Brantowce , you know, that™s the only thing that was different. And I wrote to Œ to American because it was through Am erican that I was getting that inform-information. And Œ and Œ and she Œ or Œ or Œ or Red Cross couldn™t get that information. Q: So the only pieces of information you ever had about what happened to your mother is from two sources: one, a boy who happened to have jumped off the same train Œ A: Mm-hm. Q: Œ to get his own father Œ A: Mm-hm. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 141Q: Œ to the train. A: Yeah, and he survived. Q: [indecipherable] the boy survived, the father did not. A: And Œ and his sisters were in Mexico with me. Q: Okay, and you met him in Mexico, and he said your mother had been on the breck(ph), whatever that is. A: Yeah. Q: And then the second piece of inform ation came in 1999, when from the Red Cross and from the Russian Red Cross, yo u got some information that there was a woman who had the same I.D. as your mother, but that she comes from Saint Petersburg, not fr Œ A: Yeah, and in Œ in the same time. Q: At the same time, okay. A: So Œ so this is Œ Q: And otherwise you have no idea what happened? A: No, no. Q: And what you think happened, even thou gh you don™t have the information, is that this is Œ the person from Saint Petersburg found your mother frozen and took her documents, and maybe some of her clothes. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 142A: Yeah, right. Q: So what happened to you on the train, you didn™t have any documents, it was just you and your sister. A: That™s Œ Q: And how did you eat, w ho fed you, and how long did it take from that point when you lost your mother, til you reached Jalabad(ph)? A: Almost three weeks, I think. I have Œ Q: I mean from the point you lose your mother Œ A: Œ I have dates in my books, so Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ so you c Œ you can get that, and my sister probably Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ has better Œ better recording. Q: Okay, so Œ okay, the three weeks Œ A: But Œ Q: Œ is Œ is from the point you lose your mother, not from the point you left the camp? A: Three weeks. Yeah. Q: Okay. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 143A: Yeah. Okay, what Œ what was the next question? Q: The next question is how did y ou eat, who took care of you? A: Oh, a couple Œ couple men that were fl uent in Russian and whatever, they wrote Œ they took piece of paper, they wrote similar format, our names, and we could Œ we could buy Œ or they could buy bread. On the train we had Œ my mom left a little change purse. And Œ and that Œ that™s Œ th at has a long story, too, because all of a sudden we are looking for that change pur se, and there is none. But then, a couple days later, apparently parents noticed that the little girl too-took the change purse from us, and she told them, put it back where you find it. Which is normally is said by p-parents. And she did. A ll of a sudden I pa Œ I look, and at the top of that container where it was, it™s Œ it still is. So Œ so we had some Œ I-I think I have also how much I had, but so we used up that. And then when we went to that Polish consulate, oh, I remembered, th en they gave us 40 rubles. Q: Okay. A: So we had 40 rubles plus there was like in teens, I think, of the change. So Œ so that lasted until we got to the Jalabad (ph), to that Œ that place, and Œ and then [indecipherable] about, after I think couple days, they fed us, an-and gave us good care. And then they send us to collective farm. And over there we were supposed to wait for something to happen. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 144Q: Okay. A: Orphanage or Œ or something. So after Œ after we got there, they just threw us out at the station, at the end Œ end of life Œ li Œ at the end of line. So Œ so for two days we stayed there, and we didn™t know what happen Œ will happen. Good thing we Œ we had a good send out, you know, with a little food, but not enough for two days. So Œ so we Œ we were eating, and there was a big mound of Œ it™s from maku(ph), whatever the name that means. It™s from the seeds of bawelna Œ aye-aye-aye, bawelna. That was Œ [indecipherable] bawelna ? Q: Sunflower? No. A: Y-You use for the Œ feeding the cows. Q: Corn? A: No, no, th-they use something else in Kirghizia . Corn doesn™t grow there, it™s a sandy, sandy place. Well, maybe it™ll Œ it will come back. I™ll Œ I will continue. Whatever that Œ that was, we were Œ we would Œ i-it wasn™t clean on top, so we would clean up and eat that, and it was very bitter. But, you know, better than nothing in your stomach. So Œ so someho w we survived that. And then next day comes Kirghizian man, with the big whatever Œ di dn™t look like a wagon or Œ or anything. So we Œ we just walked behi nd him, told Œ tol Œ showed us, only we didn™t understand at Œ at all what he was saying. And took us to his collective farm. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 145Q: So I want to understand. You go to a pol Œ Polish authorities in Jalabad(ph). A: Mm-hm. Q: The Polish authorities say well, okay here, we feed you, we take care of you, but go to this collective farm until we know what to do with you. Is that correct? A: But they lost completely, because the army Œ because the ar Œ that was the army. Q: Okay. A: And Œ and I guess they were not the Œ concerned about us, they were concerned more of those soldiers, becau se those soldiers came nake d almost, you know, to join the army, so Œ so they Œ Q: When you said they lost completely, they Œ th ey completely forgot you, or they Œ A: I think so, because nobo dy sh-showed up for us. Nobody ever knew wha Œ which place we are, because even that Kirghizian man, when he came he just asked us if we can go with him, so we went, because we didn™t have Œ Q: Okay, but was this the place th at you were supposed to go to? A: I don™t know, I don™t know if that was anything like that. Whatever it was, we Œ we ended up in that collective farm. And Œ and th Œ and they let us sleep in their office, because we came very Œ very late [indecipherable] by horse and Œ or Œ what Œ that wasn™t horse, what did we use there? Some Œ some other animal. Q: Okay. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 146A: Well, anyway Œ anyway so Œ so wh en we came it was almost midnight. Q: Okay. A: So we slept on floor in that, you know, cold and no Œ no he at, no nothing. It was March when we ca Œ got Œ March, we started in Œ Q: January. January fifth, I think. A: Œ January 17th. So that was more than three weeks. Yeah, because I remember it was March. Q: Okay. A: Well, anyway, when we got Œ got there, they gave us a little Œ like a bagel thing, and that™s all, but that was enough for us, our stomachs were pos Œ almost empty anyway. So, until next day Œ next day they came, and they took us to the Œ they called it lepianka . It was made of clay. Q: So a place to live. A: Place to live. It was just four walls, no floor, just sand. A opening for the stove, just there. And no place even to put the Œ the pot Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ if you had, you know atu Œ anything to cook. But anyway, that was Œ and to sleep on the Œ on the floor they told us, go in the field, pick up some Œ oh, cotton, and that was cotton seeds, the other, that mountain Œ Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 147Q: Oh, cotton seeds, okay. A: Œ cotton seeds. And very bitter, don™t try to eat that. So Œ so we picked those cotton seeds, laid them on the Œ on that sand. Then on it our Œ one of the Œ we had still comforters. So one was to sleep, the other one was to cover. So we Œ we were okay with that. And of course, on the fl oor. And then Œ and Œ and with us came another girl that was 14. I didn™t know her before, but now Œ now we™re Œ we™re in the same house, and she has two little boys, mu ch younger than she is. So Œ so Œ so we were okay as Œ Q: Five. A: Œ we had fun and Œ and wh atever. So we were there for, I don™t know, a week or something, without working. Then they tell us that we have to go to work. And one day when Œ Irka(ph) [indecipherable] we cheated. But we had got only one of those ro-round things that Œ Q: Right, the rou Œ the portion. A: Œ Irena™s portion. But we Œ we brought home, we shared it, and that was for lunch, but we didn™t have nothing for Œ for dinner, so Œ so we Œ we brought home and we Œ we ate half and half of that. So Œ so we were there until spring, until started getting warmer. Next to that hut, ther e was a Œ a Œ a big Œ bi Œ a pretty big, like a mountain. Miniature mountain. And Œ and that mountain started moving, but Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 148not mountain moving, on-only on the moun tain snakes. There was so many, and they were Œ they were coming out, and then they woul d roll up, you know. And we went to go somewhere, and here is one, here is one. So Œ so we were jumping through them, and Œ and going to Œ to the fi eld to work, or Œ or s Œ or something. Q: Did they bite? A: No. But Œ unless you step on them. And you know, bu Œ jumping over them was dangerous, but we didn™t think about it. And Œ and we started going to work, and sometimes playing, you know, and Œ and those little boys, the Œ they Œ they were mischievous, you know, so Œ so they Œ th ey started killing turtles. There were turtles. But we were s Œ not stupid, but not educated, let™s Œ let™s put it that Œ that you cannot eat turtle. You can eat turtle. Tur tle tastes like chicken, if you prepare it, you know, and Œ Q: And you cook it. A: Œ and you cook it. But they had eggs insi de, in spring they had eggs, and they Œ they were giving birth to probably someth ing. And so those eggs, the boys were catching turtles, killing them with a rock, big rock, and Œ and taking those eggs out, those poor things. Q: Yeah. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 149A: And leaving that good meat there. And Œ and Œ and their sister, she was older than I, so Œ and I knew hi Œ then she kne w how to cook those eggs. She put them on a frying pan and Œ and mixed, without Œ there™s no butter, no nothing, no Œ no bacon, no Œ Q: Nothing. A: Noth Œ so Œ but she made them somehow, and Œ and she wanted me to try, a-at least that much. And Œ and I tried and I sp it it out faster, I Œ I just couldn™t, as hungry as I was, but I couldn™t swallow that. It Œ it smelled different than Œ than an egg. So Œ so anyway, so Œ so that was th e end with the eggs. I was with my sister with Œ with weeds, we were more a soup of Œ of weeds. Q: Right. A: That Œ that™s what our mom on Siberia was Œ Q: Was making, yeah. A: Œ preparing, so Œ so that™s wh at we tried, too. And we were Œ Q: How long did you stay there? A: About four months. Four months, yeah. Q: Okay. A: And Œ and then, in the field, there wa s a Polish lady that we didn™t know. You know, everyone talks between Œ she had tw o daughters. So appa rently they were Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 150doing the same thing, one day one, the one day the other one was going. And they Œ and she Œ she saw us talking Polish. So Œ so when I Œ sh e asked me, where is your Œ she asked, where is your mamusha (ph), and I started crying. I just couldn™t keep my tears. And she just Œ the word mamusha(ph) was for me more than I could take. And at that point she said, don™t cry. Sh e Œ she hugged me and Œ and she says, I™ll Œ I™ll help you. And she Œ she says, this Su nday I™m gonna go to Polish consulate. She knew where. And Œ and she report Œ she re ported us. They send us bread and couple cans of sardines, and Œ and it was shortly before Easter. So bre-bread and sardines ta Œ what can you have? That™s a royal meal. Q: That™s a feast, yeah. A: So Œ so we Œ we had that for a couple days. And Œ oh, and Œ and at the consulate they told her, bring one of them only, at least one. Well, she chose me, although Œ and that one was older, but for some reas on she chose me. So Œ so I go. The whole day we were going there and Œ and back. Irka(ph) stayed home. When I came home, Irka(ph) was sitting already half a mile away from Œ from home and waiting for me. And Œ and of course then Œ then we Œ I gave her, probably that bread Œ what did I give you to carry? A2: [inaudible] Q: Okay. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 151A: So Œ so we went and Œ and the Œ in consulate they s Œ they said to us that we™ll send horse and buggy, and because Polish army had that, and Œ and they came and took our stuff, and Œ and took it to the Œ Q: Did they take you too? A: Oh yeah. Q: Okay. A: Then they Œ they take us all Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ to the orphanage. There, by the consulate was orphanage. So that™s where our orphanage life starts. Q: So you™re living in this collective farm, it sounds like somebody just sent you there for no reason. A: Right, but there was no orphanage. Q: Oh, got it. A: There Œ there was Œ not at that time. And later, in this Œ in this pla Œ but that was Lenin-Jol , that Œ see, I remember. In Lenin-Jol was orphanage, in Jalabad(ph) there was none at that time. But it was happening all Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ all the time, you know, somebody Œ Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 152Q: Things were changing all the time. A: Right, right. Q: Okay, so now you go to an or phanage and it happens to be in Jalabad(ph), right? A: No, no, this one in Lenin-Jol . Q: In Lenin-Jol , all right, so there Œ A: So that™s closer to Œ on this side of the mountains. Q: Okay. A: Because there is a big mountain ridge Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ in between. Q: So you go to the orphanage in Lenin-Jol , and how long do you stay there? A: Not too long, maybe month, maybe month and a half. Q: And then? A: And then we Œ we go back to Jalabad (ph). In Jalabad (ph) was a train for us. We got tickets already, and Œ and they load as many kids as they could, a-as they had on a train, and took us to Œ oh my gosh Œ A2: Krasnovodsk. A: Krasnovodsk . Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 153Q: Okay. A: In Krasnovodsk we waited in the open sun all day, no water, no nothing. The kids were dying; some children were dying, some were Œ and the teachers, you know, are Œ and Œ a-and whoever were taking care of this group, many teachers, you know, they didn™t teach, only they took care of us. Eventually they were teachers, they were Œ Q: Yeah, mm-hm. A: Œ teaching us, but Œ but not at this time. So Œ so th Œ one teacher went to get some water with a bucket, and she was bringing the Œ to the orphanage. By the time she br Œ came with this bucke t to the orphanage, the bucket was empty. People were from all over sometimes laying on the sand, you know, because they were hardly Œ and they had cup in hand, and they would Œ Q: Take water. A: Œ take water, and Œ and it wasn™t for them , she didn™t want to give, but what she could do Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ you know, people Œ people were dying from star Œ from Œ Q: Thirst. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 154A: Œ thirst. So Œ and once we got, you know, on Œ on a Œ well, and our Œ our trunk came with us. Q: The one that came all the way from Œ from Bransowice(ph)? A: Brantowce, yes. Q: Brantowce? A: Yes. Q: Oh my goodness. A: And Œ Q: Did it have anything in it le Œ any more? A: Not too much, but very important things. Skating Œ skates. Books Œ Q: Books. A: Œ that my mom told Œ told me to take. Q: Okay. A: Wait, what else was there? A suit for my mom Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ and one suit for my father. We were Œ we were thinking about them, you know Œ Q: Sure. A: Œ when we meet them, they can Œ Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 155Q: Of course. A: Œ right away get dressed and Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ and look elegant. And Œ and what Œ there were some other Œ other things, but anyway, whatever I Œ I mentioned, and the book I Œ I wanted Œ that was for Jereczek(ph). Q: Right. A: But I Œ I wanted to keep that. One of the teachers took it, and I Œ I didn™t even know which one. Skates, the teacher told me no, you can not. You don™t need it any more. We were going to Pahlevi and Teheran , you know, there was no ice. Q: Yeah. A: So Œ so that Œ that somehow she convinced me. Of course my mom™s and father™s, I cried, I want to have that, I want, because my mom and dad will not have any Œ anything to wear, to change into better clothes. And Œ and what we had on, maybe we had one change of dresses or something there. But they didn™t allow us to take that. But then I asked for book, and she allowed me to keep the book. She allowed me to Œ oh, couple pillowcases that we didn™t exchange yet. So Œ so those Œ those I Œ I had three of them, because I gave one to my sister, and one to my Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 156brother. So Œ so the pillowcases Œ and they were beautiful embroidered, with my mom™s initials. Q: Oh. A: So Œ so I still have that. And Œ and there was something else, whatever Œ but Œ but anyway, I cried and cried, and she wouldn™t let me. And Œ but who Œ who had Œ and you know that now in church Œ I Œ I belong to a choir, church choir, and we have one song that we sing, I never can fi nish. Always end up crying, because it Œ it is, when I came to the seashore, about Jesus. And ha Œ I shouldn™t talk about it, I always cry. Never can finish the song. Right away I see that in front of me, you know. Q: The trunk. A: The trunk. The trunk is Œ was so important to me at that time. But Œ Q: It was the last piece from your life of your family. A: Right. I have those little things yet, you know, but Œ but those are not that important, apparently. In my book I Œ I dr ew that trunk there, you will find it when you read it. And I don™t know. Si Œ Q: It must have very hard to leave that trunk. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 157A: Yeah. Although I took those spa Œ fe w things, you know, but Œ but it™s not important as Œ as that was. That was my Œ my mom™s Œ how do you call, thing for the wedding Œ Q: Trousseau? A: Œ from her grandmother. Trousseau. Q: Her di Œ her trousseau. A: Trousseau, filled up, you know, from Œ from her babcia. So Œ so it was important. And I don™t know if I ever Œ I ev er change, as far as that, you know, for Œ my mom was Œ was Œ I cannot forget her, and Œ and that™s the reason why I wrote book. That was because I wanted to Œ somebody to find. I thought that some miracle will be, and Œ and somebody to find. Well, I found a little girl. I found Œ she came here to visit her son, from Poland. And Œ and she remembered me. She w Œ she wanted to Œ to come to see us. And I thought maybe we™ll develop a friendship, but Œ but she says she has to go back to Poland, she™s just visiting her son. Q: Now, you found a little girl who knew your mother? A: Well, she™s Œ she™s now the adult woman like me. Q: Yes, yes. A: So Œ so Œ so she found, through the book. Her son bought the book, and Œ and her Œ her son saw the last name, because he Œ he and his father have the same last Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 158name. So Œ so now I Œ I met her, but that ™s the last thing, and not what I was looking for. But what can you do? We are praying, we are doing, and God is leading us. And why? I Œ I often ask th Œ Irka(ph), you know, why do we live? Two of us? I guess this is the purpose. Q: We don™t know. A: Yeah. Q: We don™t know. A: Yeah. Q: So you had to get on that transport to Pahlevi Œ A: Yeah. Q: Œ without the trunk. A: Without the trunk. Q: What was the transport Œ A: And I was the last one from the orphanage to get on in the Œ on the Œ that Œ Q: On the boat? A: On the boat. And the Œ and I remember everything, you know, the Œ the walk was boards, some of them missing. So the teacher says, watch it, so your leg doesn™t fall in. But Œ and Œ and it was only standing room, and those children that were sick, they would be sent Œ sitting on the Œ on the floor in the tra Œ in the ship. And those Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 159ships, they Œ they were not the real ship, not transport. Those were transporting the Œ probably coal or something, and they cleaned up and Œ and are taking Œ were taking children and people, you know. They Œ they transported, I think 12,000. It could be 12,000 or plus some Œ some small amount. I have, from the tu Œ in the book Œ Q: Twelve thousand people, or 12,000 children, or Œ A: People. Q: Twelve thousand people and then Œ A: And s Œ and soldiers. Q: Okay, in this Œ on this boat, or Œ A: No, no, no. Q: No, no, no. A: No, no, there was maybe five, six transportations through the Caspian Sea to Pahlevi. Q: Okay. A: In Œ in Pahlevi and Karachi we ended up. Q: So, and Œ okay, so you end up in Pahlevi, and how long do you stay there? That™s part of Iran. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 160A: In Pahlevi they asked to Œ or they took us to the shower. We all had to take shower. They cut the hair Œ or previously they cut the Œ the hair, so we were all bald. And then Œ and then they changed us to a different section of the Œ of the camp, on sand, not Œ under th e sun. I don™t think there was any Œ any Œ how do you call Œ there was any of what? I forgot here . Oh, tents. There was no tent Œ excuse me Œ just the Œ the food when they Œ and I ha Œ we di Œ we slept on a blanket, on the sand, and it was soft and warm. And Œ til morning, and then got up and ran straight to the sea to take a bath. Oh, I Œ I enjoyed, to me that was a Œ a fun. Finally I could swim. Oh, I didn™t tell you at Œ at the kibietka(ph), when we were in Œ in the ca Œ in the kohaus (ph), one day, I don™t know what I was wearing, did I have bathing suit with me or what, but I jumped into [indecipherable], which is water Œ waters coming from the mount Œ mountains, melting snow. Q: Okay. A: And Œ and it was fast running water. I jumped in on our side, ended up about half a mile farther Œ Q: Really? A: Œ on the other side. Q: Because the current was so strong? Oh my goodness. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 161A: And I Œ and I Œ I knew s Œ how to swim , but not properly. I wasn™t a good Œ good swimmer, I was just a swimmer. Q: But you made it out of there. A: I made it on the other side. Q: Yeah. A: The only thing, on the other side was Kirghizian village, and this one we had only one Œ one kibietka(ph) and that™s it. So Œ so on the other side kids were, I think, with open mouths, how could I do that? I don™t think they Œ they knew how to swim. Q: Yeah. A: Because I don™t think any mother would allow kids to Œ to go into water like that. Q: No, it™s too dangerous. It™s too dangero us. Okay, so Œ so in some ways your odyssey out from the Soviet Union is over by this point. A: Yes. Q: Did your life change? Did it Œ did it get Œ did i Œ anything be come brighter, or was it all overshadowed because you had lost your mother? A: Probably one and then two. Q: Both of them. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 162A: Both of them, yeah. Q: Yeah. A: Yeah, I Œ I never quit. And then in Teheran , we were waiting for other transport [indecipherable] yet, you know, and they Œ and they were bringing every day the couple buses of the deportees or Œ or whatevers. And Œ and we would run with Irka(ph) to the Œ to that Œ and that was a airport place that I can Œ I think it was used by American soldiers. And Œ an-and we would ru n there and wait and watch each person coming. And at the end, we would hug each other, no Mama. No Mama. That was th-the probably saddest place where Œ where we [indecipherable] , because from here we already knew that she didn™t came out from Russia. Because all through her th Œ Teheran were coming people from Russia, were Œ have t Œ had to stop there. Q: It was the first place. A: First place. There was a hospital that was available, there was a place where like Irka(ph) had to go to Œ to that place. Sh e™ll probably tell you that. And they wanted to Œ to take Irka(ph) only to that place. And we Œ we got two Œ two of us, no, you will not take her away. Q: Yeah. A: Irka(ph), you will not Œ she will not stay. I am not going. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 163Q: Yeah. A: So Œ so we Œ we tried to Œ we didn™t trust anybody any more. Because there were some instances that they would not Œ oh wait, again, I™m Œ I™m getting blockages. Q: That Œ that people wouldn™t let you be together, is that it? They Œ they would split you apart? A: Well, they wanted to take her for the place where they will feed her Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ give her better food Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ and I didn™t need that. I Œ I was Œ could be eating only Œ Q: You were healthier. A: I-I was healthier, ta Œ right. Q: Okay. So Œ A: And Œ and she Œ and started from Siberia, she was always undernourished, so she had problem always, and she still has. But G-God is good to us. So Œ and her Œ Q: Did you hear from your brothe r? Did you know what was go Œ A: Nothing Œ Q: Nothing. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 164A: Œ nothing, we didn™t know yet, un til we Œ after couple months we were transferred to Maleer(ph). Maleer (ph) was a little away from Œ from the sea, camp for the Polish army, which never was u Œ not Polish, for American army. In India they had stationed American soldiers. So Œ so they gave tha Œ this for the orphanage, a thousand kids. Q: And this was in India? A: That was in India. Q: So you moved from Œ A: From Œ Q: Œ Iran to India ? A: Yes. Q: Okay. A: And then ha Œ oh, I di Œ I Œ oh, I skipped a little bit. I skipped because from Teheran, we went to Isfahan. And Isfahan was Œ was a Œ was a city of wealthy per Œ pers Œ persovia Œ per Œ Q: Persians. A: Persians. And they donated thei r homes, summer homes to the Polish Œ Q: Orphans. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 165A: Œ orphans. So there was five Œ over 5,000 orphans there. And Œ and so they transferred us to Œ to that camp number si x. And number six wa s the largest, there was 300 children. And that was some kind of convent, I think. And there was a Œ a church by that, and there was bishop presid ing there, so Œ so that was a big, big place. And we had already organized school [coughs] Excuse me. And I was in fifth grade, because in Poland I was Œ I finished fourth and started fifth, but never Œ never finished, because of whatever th ere. So Œ so we got separated with Irka(ph). Irka(ph) was in one building, I was in the other building, but we were close, so we were gradually getting used to it. And Œ and Irka(ph) by then was little better. But her teeth were not better, but that™s her subj ect. But I had to drag her to the dentist. Oh, she was Œ no, she won™t Œ doesn™t want to go. She has very sensitive teeth, and I wish I would share with her. I Œ I go to dentist, at 86, I still have my teeth, and my Œ and Œ and she Œ she has problem. So Œ but somehow Œ Q: But it also sounds like you took care of each other. A: On Siberia , salt to Œ to brush your teeth. Q: Oh my. A: That™s what my Œ our ma Œ mom told us. And I still use salt rinse before I go to sleep. Kills the germs, and it™s not tasting good, but Œ Q: It does the trick. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 166A: Yeah, and in Œ in Isfahan , we had very good teache r, fifth grade teacher. And she gave us a project to do, to fi Œ to write your story of the Siberian deportation. Q: That™s a very good project. A: Whatever Œ whatever you lived, from your home til now, it™s Œ and I wrote mine, I don™t know how many pages. A2: Four. A: Pardon me? Q: Four pages. A: Oh no, more than that. Q: Okay. A: Well, whatever. I Œ I think it™s like 15 or something. Q: Okay. A: But that™s okay. [indecipherable] And Œ and that is the beginning of my si Œ my writing the story. She Œ I kind of build it in-into me, one thing to Œ to write something. But I Œ but ma ybe another teacher in Mexico . Q: Also? A: That was another s Œ time that I was in structed to Œ to write another Œ oh, you right maybe Œ maybe you right, because I have written another one, and that one is about 15 pages, in Mexico Œ Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 167Q: Okay. A: Œ when I was in, I think first y ear or second year in high school. Q: Okay, and so this first one could have been shorter. A: Right, right. Q: Do you still have both of these writings? A: I am sure I do, because I don™t throw out nothing. Q: Okay. A: I ha Œ I™m Hector collector. In Œ would you believe in Poland I started. Q: Oh yeah? A: You know what? A little pieces of glass, colored glass. That attracted me, so that was my collection in Poland. Q: Before you left. A: Before I left. Q: Before you left. Before you were deported. A: Yeah, yeah. Q: Okay, I™d like to kind of wrap this up, I know that there are a lot of sections that we can™t pay as much attention to, but I™d like also to be able to talk to Œ A: Irka(ph). Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 168Q: Œ your sister today. So after Œ after India, after you were in India, at some point you were sent to Mexico , is this correct? A: Yes, yes. Q: And this was all with the orphanage? A: Yes. Q: All right. How Œ were you in India Œ okay, let me put it this way, phrase the question this way: when did they send you to Mexico, what year? A: That was at the end of ™43, I think. Q: Okay. A: In November. On November first, I think we arrived in León , Guanajuarto , and Œ and that™s Œ that™s where Œ Q: And why in Mexico ? Was there another orphanage there or something? A: No. General Sikorski visited Mexi-Mexico . I think that was with the suggestion from maybe Œ maybe President Roosevelt , because I™m sure he came and asking for the staying in United States, for the ca Œ bringing some Œ some Polish people to Œ to U.S.A., and Œ and I know Roosevelt wanted to be friends with Stalin, and who Œ who of Poles would want to be friends with Stalin any more? Q: Yeah. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 169A: So Œ and Œ and of course that wouldn™t go with the Œ along with the politics. So Œ so possibly that™s where it came from, and so General Sikorski went to Œ to the mexi Œ to Mexico to ja Œ to the president of Mexico, and Œ and he agreed. He Œ he says, I can find for 50,000 Polis h refugees. So that was Œ Q: That™s huge. A: Œ the Œ the beginning, but it didn™t happen. Q: Okay. A: First group arrived in Mexico on July second, or something like that. Q: July second which year? A: Forty-three. Q: Forty-three. A: And the Œ and the second one arrived on November Œ I think first. So Œ so whatever Œ what Œ whatever was promised, didn™t happen, because United States didn™t want to Œ I don™t know didn™t want, didn™t have ships, or whatever, the war was, you know, in Œ in Œ Q: Going on. A: Œ going on and Œ and possibly Œ so Œ so all the Polish people went to the English colonists in Africa. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 170Q: I see. But you made it to Mexico. A: Right. Q: Were you on the first, or on the second Œ A: Second. Q: In November. A: Mm-hm. Q: And you went by boat, by ship? A: By ship, and that was a huge, huge Œ th e ship weighed I Œ I also za Œ forgot Œ R Œ R something. No. Well anyway, whatever the name is, it™s in the book. I™m sending Œ Q: Everything to the book. A: Œ everything to the book. Q: And the book, we have to say Œ we have to mention the name was Œ tell me the title of your book. A: ﬁThe Fulfillment of Visionary Œ Q: Œ return. A: Œ Dream .ﬂ Q: ﬁThe Fulfillment of Visionary Dream.ﬂ A: That™s why I wanted to give you another one Œ Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 171Q: Ah, okay. A: Œ but I guess so Œ so Œ so return, you have return Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ because those were the first editions. Q: I see, and it is the visionary dream. ﬁ The Fulfillment of Visionary Dream.ﬂ A: And this one was a little Œ the truth is al ways the same, and whatever else I did, corrected some Œ some Œ but I had very good editor. Q: Okay, okay. So now when we™re talking, you™re in Mexico in November, and are you taken to another red Œ orphanage? A: No, it was the same. Mexico gave us a hacienda, whic h is like big property of somebody that is not around, or gave that , I do Œ I really don™t know the story of that. And [indecipherable] Santa Rosa , and that was enough for school, a huge school building, high school was in a little different Œ but i-in Œ within the roun Œ around the same area. So Œ so we Œ we had very good t eachers. We have even Œ I don™t know if you are familiar of a Jesus of Mercy. The priests that brought Jesus of Mercy, a story, or Œ or whatever, to United States, across the ocean, was my teacher. I have that many letters from him. Q: Wow. A: From Œ and Œ an d he was a priest. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 172Q: Was this a particular order? A: Yes, Marian. Q: Okay. A: Marian father Œ Q: Marian order, okay. A: Marian fathers. Q: Okay. A: And Œ and he came here to United States, and brought all the papers of Sister Faustina. So Œ so all Œ all this Œ that story was Œ and when I was writing book, I went Œ I had at that time, I bought a Œ a little house in Florida , and I went to f Œ to that house, and that™s where I have written the book. Q: Oh. A: And every day, whenever I started writing, I would pray to him, because he Œ he was al-already was dead, and all the story I knew about him, you know, so Œ and seems like always something happened if I didn™t pray, and I couldn™t s Œ could not continue to write. And then I thought, why can™t I get back in the Œ and all of a sudden, oh, I didn™t pray. I pray and then for the rest of the day I will write without stopping. Q: You were fine. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 173A: So Œ and then I had three occurrences that was, I don™t know how to call, the vision or something, or it was tired visi on, or what. Maybe Œ maybe somebody who is more educated would know something ab out it. But at night I would wake up, something wakes me up. And one time the whole ceiling, I don™t see the ceiling, I don™t see the pictures. Like I am in some kind of thing, and Œ and all of a sudden disappears after Œ after a while. And that ha ppened three times, and I thought, is my Mama trying to Œ Q: Reach you. A: Œ appear to mia Œ to Œ to me? Yeah. Those are Œ those are the things for somebody with more education, more faith maybe to Œ to Œ to receive. But I don™t have even one picture, because my uncle, the one in Wolkowysk , he had to destroy his pictures. Q: The one who was left Œ A: The one that Œ Q: Œ your mother™s younger brother. A: Right. He Œ he says he probably bu ried them maybe in his backyard or something, and Œ and wa ter came and you know Œ Q: Destroyed, yeah. Interview with Stanis awa Tobis January 28, 2015 174A: Œ he had to destroy them anyway. So Œ so whatever. But he Œ he Œ when I was there, he brought me his album. I reme mber the same album that I was looking when we were visiting them. And Œ and I Œ I saw so many missing Œ missing spots. And he left those, the same way as th ey were before the war, except missing pictures of my family. Q: Oh, how sad. A: Because he was trying to Œ to sh Œ to Œ to con Œ Q: Conceal. A: Œ conceal the Œ his Œ his relationship to Œ because my father was involved in so many Œ so many things, that he was Œ he was one on the list, that we will deport him. And so he says he was packed. He Œ his things were in bundles Œ Q: Ready to go. A: Œ because whenever they were coming, somebody woul d inform him, and Œ and he would be trying, you know, be ready. But somehow he Œ they couldn™t find pictures. Probably they were looking for pictures. So Œ Q: Such unbelievable detail. Unbelievable. So you were in Mexico in the orphanage for how long, for how many years? A: From November ™43, to May ™46. Q: Three years. And you finish ed your high school there?
