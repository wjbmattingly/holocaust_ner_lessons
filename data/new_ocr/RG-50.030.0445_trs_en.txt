My father died very, when I was six or, six, seven years old, a heart attack. He had a very, how should I say, act ive life, he ________________, that's in Germany. He had a factory of glassware and so forth and he traveled around all Prague, Czechoslovakia, Budapest, England, France. A very, very strenuous life, you know. But he was very how should I say, strong willed. My mother always said to him, "Take it easy, you can't eat more that one schnitzel and that's enough." But he _______________ and then one very bad day, he passed away and my brother, the oldest one, which unfortunately died in the first World War, took fa ther's part. He was the one who kept the family going, you know what I mean? And then I grew up an d when I was, yeah and that's a very funny part. My mother wanted not me, a boy, she al ways wanted a girl. And while she 2 wanted a girl, she, how shall I say, brought me up like a girl. I had long hair to my shoulders, reddish hair and so on, so forth and in school they called my Touc hin(ph) because my hair, hair was like a girl. And I cried and went home and was like, I'm not going to school any more unless you cut my hair. If you don't, forget about it, they called me Touchin( ph) all ready and I don't like that at all. All right, all right, don't get excited and she went to the ba rber with me, cut, but what does she do? She cut it up to here, _______________ you know, what we called in Germany, ________________. But of course I was alrea dy happy that that long hair was gone and so on and so forth. And then as I said before, I went to the ________________ for ________________, high school ________________. And I was a very, freak child but there's a funny story. I was not supposed to come really. I th ink my being here, how shall I sa y it in German? (speaks German here) I shouldn't have come. My mother was forty when I was born, so they didn't expect me and I came as a seven months boy, weig hing only few pounds. The doctor always told, put Rolfie in the ruhrer(ph), you know what the ruhrer (ph) is? In Berlin they have the big ovens, from floor to the ceiling and in the middle they put apples in to be browned and stuff to keep warm and put Rolfie in the ruhrer(ph), they called that the ruhrer(ph) and Rolfie was put in the ruhrer(ph) and our landlord always said, "Can we see Rolfie?" Mother said, "No, he is in the ruhrer(ph)." They laughed their heads off because they didn't be lieve, how can a kid, child, be in the ruhrer(ph), you follow me? And here's the story. And as I said before I was very weak and so on and so forth and in school I learned Latin, English, French and I had a teacher, Dr. Mink(ph) and he says , "Rolfie, you are very intelligent, you should learn all..." I said, "Doctor, it's too much for me, I can't." I always lost, what do you call it, _______________? Q: Your consciousness? 3 A: Yeah. And my mother came then and said, may I make a long story short, after, as I said I've been up to ______ _________ and then I left school. Q: At what age di d you leave school? A: 15,16. And there I met my friend. He was two years older th an I, I was 16, her was 18, but we met, how shall I say it, you know, like boys meet. He was very fond of me, he said, "You are a beautiful boy," bah, bah, bah and so on, so forth. He bought me chocolate, _______________ chocolate and took me to the movies and so on, so forth an my mother sa id, "You spoil the boy, don't do that." He says, "But I like to. I get ________ _______, pocket money and what shall I do with it? And Rolfie ha s _______________, so I buy ___________ ____ chocolate." And we got very fond of each other, but nothing what you think, sex or so, just friendship. An d then I went, my eldest brother, who died in the fi rst World War was in a firm for ov er 20, 25 years and the boss of the firm knew my mother and me very well and he said, "Send the boy to me, I want him, to teach some ____." And I went there as a apprentice. Q: What was the na me of the firm? A: Popo(ph) and Ferve(ph). I, they had buttons , dresses, what do you call it? Well anyway, short things, you know what I mean? An d he thought I was very intelligen t and soon he let me take a box with all the stuff and go in the neighborhood trying to sell stuff, you know. And believe it or not, I had a very good reception. Wherever I came, people we re very nice to me, I sold and bah, bah, bah. Q: At what time was that, what y ear did you start with apprentice? A: 1926, 27, about that ti me. But then after awhile I didn't lik e it and I met anothe r guy in the line and he said, "I have a much better job for you, you can sell much better in side, you don't have to wander around crazy" and I went to _______________ Lehman(ph), _______________ in Berlin and there Mr. Faulk(ph), the director , very friendly to me and I was there for four or five years and 4 then, '31, '32, I didn't lik e it, because they took advantage of me and so on, so forth, so my mother said, "Why don't you just take it easy for awhile." Because as I told you before, I wasn't too well and not too strong, you know. Q: What kind of health problems did you have? A: Pardon me? Q: What health prob lems did you have? A: I fell, I became ___ ____________, you know what _______________ is? Q: Yeah, you lost yo ur consciousness. A: Yeah. Well, my friend very often, if we went to a movie or _______________ and so on, so forth, all of a sudden I was gone. So he was the one who rea lly, how shall I say it? Took care of me and he always said, "Don't do that, don't do that," and so on. And my mother all of a sudden took a very big liking to him. He came every Friday evening for dinner to our house. He was like the second child, you know what I mean ? And, but at that time, we started already having sex. And he took me on trips to Venice, Italy, to Budapest in Hungary, and we went practically everywhere. Switzerland very often an d so on and so forth. And I had a good time. Q: Can you describe your friend? A: Pardon me? Q: Can you describe your frie nd a little bit and how did he go, no, in those times? A: Well he took over, his father, I d on't know, when did you leave Germany? Q: Say it again? A: When did you leave Germany? Q: 10 years ago. 5 A: Can you remember shoeboots _______________ and cleaning _______________? Well, his father had a factory on ________________ in Berlin. But he got very old, 76, 78, so he and his brother took over the factory. He was a salesman , traveling all over Deutschland(ph) and even to Switzerland, so forth, selling, and his brother wa s the inside man, factory, you know, you know, the shoeboots, polish had to be done during the night and daytime it was too wa rm and too difficult to do. Anyway, they had a big outfit, very well known, ________________ shoeboots and Spectrol(ph) _______ _________, which was very well known. I show you later, an ashtray. And he was very well known, big department stores. Vairtime(ph), Teats(ph), Ya ndorf(ph), all these big stores. Mr. Kroner(ph), any time, we like your stuff and so on, so forth. Q: He owned, no, he owned these department stores? A: The father owned, started it in 1910 and he took it over 1926, not he, he and his brother, they two. His father remained in the fa ctory, but only as a, how shall I sa y, giving advice, so on, so forth, but he wasn't practically any mo re in, in the firm, you follow me? He, my friend and his brother were the ones who we re running the place. Q: But I didn't understand full y, the connection to Vairtime(ph) for example, did he own Vairtime(ph) or work for Vairtime(p h) for the big department stores? A: He sold to Vairtime(ph). Q: He sold to Vairtime(ph)? A: Yeah, that stuff, that shoe boots and that _______ ________, which was ve ry well known and very well liked. As I said, we had a wonderful life, traveled and coul dn't be better, let's put it this way. And then came 192 8, '29, his brother married a Jewish girl , she was very, how shall I say, she wasn't like a girl, she was like a man, you know an d oh, I forgot to tell you, the brother, in the World War, first World War, went in the World Wa r and got shot in his spine. They couldn't 6 remove it, they left it there and he was very handicapped from that shooting. Always laying down and bah, bah, bah. When he came from the factory sh e did everything for him, so on and so forth. But she didn't like that her brothe r-in-law, my friend, had an affair with me. And his mother told her once, what don't you li ke on Rolf? I think he's the most charming fellow, beautiful fellow, what do you want from him? And Emil (ph) is very fond of him. So, but you know in that time, homosexuality in the 20's was like th e red cloth to the steer, you know what I mean? So she always, so she said one day, "You go with him." No, "I will arrange an appointment with Dr. Marcus Hirschfeld. He should see you and see whether he can help you to get rid of it." I laughed out loud, didn't say a word and when we were al one, I said to him, "I think she' s crazy. She can't, this is not a sickness, what, what does she think that it is?" "But if she _________ ______ you, I te ll you what, we are going both to Dr. Marcus Hirschfeld, making an appointment, tell him what we experience with your sister-in-law, that we don't like it, that we are _______________ crazy, crazy about things, she doesn't know more" and so on and so forth. And we went to Dr. Marcus Hirschfeld. Q: Can you explain as to who Dr. Marcus Hirschfeld is, in that time? A: Dr. Marcus Hirschfeld was a man who, in Ge rmany was a law 175, ye s the homosexuality law, number 175 and he had a big practice in the _______________. That is like a little Central Park, you know what I mean? A big house, a villa and he had patients there, laying on one side and here was his private house and very often he made, how shall we say, balls on Saturday evening for the homosexual, with 150, 200 people there, dancing in the garden there and so on and so forth. High prices, but this money was good for him because for that he can experi ence, go places and look for, etcetera, etcetera. But anyway, as I said before, we went to him an d he came in and I never forget that. Should I tell you? Where we hang our hat and our coats, there are all pricks out a foot around the whole thing, you know. I screamed out laughing and the guy who was sitting on the desk, 7 "What are you laughing mister?" I said, "That's too funny. To put ha ngers like this in a..." " Well," he says, "this is our trademark, pe riod." We were besides ourself th at's ____. So then he came in, he was a little, stout man, I expect ed something completely different, but he is very, how shall I say, imposing and I told him the story. And he said, "Why do you send that wo man to me and I will clear her mind and tell her what is wh at and why is why. This is not a sickness, this is what you are born with, period. And there's no question about it." I said my friend was very, how shall I say, backward, you know, he never... So I said, "Doctor, would you do me a big favor?" "Certainly, what is it?" "Send a letter to that woman and just te ll her, or write to her what you told us right now and I would be very, very happy and appreciate it no end." "No question about it, tomorrow the letter goes out." So the next Friday evening we came to Emil's(ph) parents for dinner and she came in. She didn't speak to him, she spoke right away to me, "What did you do ?" I said, "What did I do?" "Well," she says, "I got a lett er." I said, "And does that clear up your mind? Does that make you feeling better?" "It's unbelie vable what you did and why you did, giving my address and my name." I said, "Look, you bothered Emil so much and he was so depr essed that I wanted to shut it out once and for all and that's wh y we went to Dr. Marcus Hirschfe ld and he sent you the letter and that should clear your mind, period ." So his mother said, "When Ro lf told you what he just told you, isn't that enough for you? Don't you have to go on?" "I ha ve it my way and not his way." So we were, how shall I say, not very friendly all the ti me, you know, til we left. Q: I have a question because you st arted to tell us that she proposed that you both go to Dr. Marcus Hirschfeld. Was he very known in Germany at this time? A: Yeah. Very well known. Q: Why? A: Pardon me? 8 Q: Why was he so known? A: Because, as I just told you, like here for instance, sex or, it was very open, you know. He had, as I told you, balls on Saturdays, making money and so on and so forth. Pe ople come, came from practical all over the world lookin g for advice from him and he wa s very, very well known. Very well known. So that made her, I think, she had the idea that he could do something about it. But he, smart man as he was, told her right away, this is not a sickness, th ere can be nothing done about it, this is something that you're born with, period. And that's why he wrote her the letter on my account. But she was still not 100 percent satisfied, but I didn't car e any more because what we did was more than enough, period. Q: You said that he lived in an institute, in a big villa. What did he do in th is institute, exactly, do you know this? A: There were people, how sh all I explain it? It's like, not a hospital, it's like a, a there were people, men, who wanted to be a woman, and they were operated on. We re laying there for one or two months, til they healed and so and that was in 1925, '26, '27, a big affa ir, very big, very known people, I don't know, at the time be ing were, couple of them went and got operated on and as I told you before, this side was like a charity and this was a lift and then he was, has a big park and in that park were the parties for 175. Q: Did you ever go to one of these parties? A: Once I went. And I, I tell you why I went. He and I, we were very, very, how shall we say, careful. He had to be on account of his employers and the factory and I didn 't want him to be laughed at or whatever it is, God forbid and so on an d so forth, so we were ve ry, very careful. Very seldom. But that time was a masquerade, so nobo dy would know. He didn't take it, I took a mask out, he didn't, he just went. So I said, "I want to go." "All right , if you want to go, 9 _______________ , but I don't ____." So what shall I tell you? I went to a very famous masquerade man, who for the theater ____________ ___, I don't know whether that name rings a bell with you. I think he's, not today any more, but he was for a long time very famous. And I went there and I said, "Look, Hirschfeld gives a party, I'd like to, would love to go in a masquerade and then I can have my hat and my fa ce masked and so on, so forth." "Mr. Hirschberg, don't worry. Show me your legs." I said, "What are you talking about?" I said, "Show me your legs." I put my _______________ up. "Oh, we ____, perfect, perfect." I said, "What's perfect?" "You have no bowlegs, that's very good, very im portant to that costume I want to give you." I said, "What kind of costume do you want to give me?" "You go as a fowl." What do you call it, a fowl, here in English? You know ? _______________? Q: Is it a ph easant? No. A: ________________. Q: Is feathers? A: Yeah, feathers. Big and beauti ful, blue. We call it a fowl at that time and a fowl has a big schnabbel(ph) you know what I mean and everything in blue silk and a red sweater and the legs blue and the red shoes and as I said, the wings, the arm. Q: Feathers? A: Yeah. And how much? "____ mark." I said, "What are yo u saying, _________ ______ mark?" "But Mr. Hirschberg, when you get the prize you get 5000 mark s and I bet you you get a prize. I went home, I said, "I'll let you know." And I came home and I spoke to Em il, he says, "If you like it, if you want it, take it. Once you go and once you want to have fun, why not? Take it." So I went back next day and he measured ev erything, bah, bah, bah. "And next Saturday, one day before next Saturday, you come and we try your costume." I went there and we tried. He says, "I don't know 10 what to say, if you don't get the prize, I am, my name isn't Hans any more. Okay. So the evening comes and Emil took the car and he drove me, we have drove to Sasette n(ph), that is a park where it is. And at 12 o'clock, they had Potlesser(ph), is that a name you know of?

And I was dancing and he was always firm , you know what I mean and it was too funny for words, for anyway. Q: What would, I didn 't understand that? He was too funny? A: This is the, you know, try to be sexy. [End of Side 1] Q: So how many people were there at th is Saturday night, this special party? A: 200, approximately. Well any, can I talk? An yway, he came and danced a dance with me and then all of a sudden he said to me , "Can we have a drink at the bar?" I said, "No, we can't, I'm here with my friend and..." "Oh, your friend, your friend." To make a long stor y short, 12 o'clock, please _______________ and there was a big stairway, one, two, about 20 stairs.

And Emil was embarrassed, "Don't take the money." I said, "I certainly take the money. We pa id _______________ , shoot I'm not crazy, of course I take it." Well that was the one ball we went to Marcus Hirschfeld. Never again and so on and so forth. And everything was fine, fine, fine. Then came '32, all of a sudden, Mr. Hitler appeared on the horizon, you know. And we went once to the, what was the name of th e movie _______________, all the way up, oh good lord, well anyway, we went there and next to us was a Nazi sitting there in uniform with this girl. And they were very noisy and very and I said, "We would like to listen to the picture, sir." "You dirty Jew, what do you want? If you don't like it, get the hell out of here." And you know, Emil, gentleman from tip to to e, pushed my hand, le t's go out and we went out. I went to the manager, told him what happened. "We want our money back," I said, because I was very, very annoyed. And, "Sir, I can't help it, I know you ar e two gentlemen, but this ____, scum of the scum, what can I do?" And so on, so fort h.

And from that day on, we didn't, we went to the theater, we went also to concerts and so forth, but movie where you sit close to, we tried to avoid, you know what I 12 mean? And 1936, I started getting letter, you dirty Jew, we know you are a homosexual and so on, so forth, you better look out and but we get you and bah, bah, bah. I was very excited and my mother said, "Ah, that's stupid." I said, "Don't say that 's nonsense, these guys are liable to do everything or anything." So I went to my lawyer .

You mentioned that you are Jewish, but how was it growing up Jewish before 1933 in Berlin? A: Like everybody else. The religion had to do an ything with you or for you or against you. As a matter of fact, they never held my friend or me as a Jew? Why? A Jew hasn't got blue eyes, they have dark eyes and don't have re d hair and are not blonde like he was.

Til '34, '35, when it started. Q: Were you brought up Jewi sh, going to th e synagogue? A: No, no.

Q: What is voklish(ph)? A: It's, could happen, that you were molested or, but as I told you before, neither he nor I, we tried very, very little to, in masses or, just stay our way, you know what I mean and mostly we traveled. We were more out of Be rlin than in Berlin. Q: Did you stay out of crow ds, of masses because you... A: We never liked it, never. Neither he nor I. Ne ver, never. We always, how shall I say? Not that we were hide or hidden, no, no, no , we just didn't like it, period. Q: When did you experi ence for the first time, discrimination or anti-Jewish remarks or an experience? A: That was in 19, when we went to that movie where the Nazi sat next to us and made that lousy remark and ____, as I said before, he looked like a gentile and I looked like a gentile, nobody cared, thought we were Jews.

I could have fallen dead, because you as a Nazi? Do me one favor, don't co me into my house any more, not in the uniform. If you come as a civil man, fine. In uniform we ar e strangers, period." And I closed the door. This was my experience with the Nazis. Q: What happened to your mother when you left her in the house for elderly? A: I had, 1936, she went and thank God, there was another friend of the daughter, went to Israel and this woman knew my mother very well and they were in one room with two beds. So she wrote me a letter, unfortunately I lost them, I don't know why, she's very happy, Mrs. Cooper is so nice to her. My mother was nearsighted, she's helping me and so on and so forth and ba h, bah, bah and I'm not alone. Unexpectedly, I'm so happy I can't tell you. And I was happy t oo, knowing that she was satisfied, so on, so forth. And as a year, oh yeah, now, when we had this apartment, after three weeks, my telephone rung. "Yes?" I said. "Can I speak to Mr. Hirschberg?" I said, "Speaking." "Here is Adele Livingston." "Yes , what can I do for yo u?" "Oh you speak such nice English. I thought you hardly would..."

"On 72nd Street, between Park and Flexing(ph). Would you like to come to morrow?" I said, "Not tomorrow." Oh yeah and I forgot, in the meantime, while we were on 46th Street in the school, Emil met a gentleman who has a drugstore in Breslow(ph) in Germany. And when he saw Emil, he hugged and kissed him, "What are you doing here?" And so on a nd so forth, and he says, "Would yo u like to open with me?" Emil says, "I can't, I, because I try in Haifa to my shoeboots and ..." "Yeah, but we can in the meantime make here, that we make some money and ____." You know _______________? Raspberry syrup.

On the other hand you had in Berlin, as you told us, many bars for homosexuals, also different kinds of bars. You were in a relationship. So how did you feel as a homosexual in these years before '33 and then between '33 and '37. A: Like a stranger, to tell you th e truth. Because I was born in Ber lin, right? And I was a Berliner. But when the Nazi's came you had th e feeling you are a stranger, all of a sudden. Why? As I told you my school friend, who I know in his heart he hated the Nazi's , but he put on the Nazi's uniform, comes to a Jews house, surprises me that I nearly got a heart attack when I opened the door and saw him as a Nazi, I said, "Richard, are you crazy? Or do you want to frighten me? Or is that a masquerade?" And then he told me that if he wants to live and if he has to get work, he has to put on the uniform. And I know deep in his heart, I know him so well, that he hated them and I, I don't know what to say, you know? And still he put it on. And in my opinion there were many, many like him. In their heart they hate d them, but outside they had to agree. Why? They had to live, period. Q: Did you feel accepted being a homosexual and being Jewish in Germany before 1933?

We went, I never forget we went home, he says, "Let's go to America." I says, "Why?" _________________. "That's the end for me," he says. I hear him like today. Q: But were you ever recognized or di scriminated as a homosexual before 1933? A: We never, how shall I say it? We never dresse d or overdressed, you follo w me? Like our people were used to do. On the contrary , sometimes, I had once a fur jacket or what fo r a birthday, I think, on my 25th or what, he bough t it and he, I had it at home since th e time, that Nazi's came to power, but it shouldn't, _______________, you see, a friend of mine in the house took the _______________, a very famous doctor, he wrote me a le tter, "Rolfie, _______________ wouldn't believe it, the day you left, they had two Nazi's fami lies, set in your apartment." Q: But you said you were very car eful in public, also before 1933, when you were together with your friend Emil, why? Why were you careful?

A: Oh no, he would have, __ _____________ you know, they are very, very fresh. _______________ well I know you, but if yo u are willing to stop my mouth, I will keep quiet, but you see and that he didn't want, he wanted to avoid it, that's why he kept always aside, always. I sometimes say, "You're crazy, you're a young man, you shou ld," "I enjoy myself in my way. I don't have to dance like you do and so forth, so o n. I enjoy it. I enjoyed seeing you dancing, having a good time." He always said that, always. Q: But he couldn't have gone to the police when he would have been blackmailed? A: That was a beginning that we thought to walk out of Germany, when I go t those letters, that was a start. Beginning of '36, fo r six or eight months and my la wyer _______________, he said, "Rolfie, don't be afraid, these are beginners. They don't even know that simply, lousy, Nazi youngsters, they want to make money and thin g they can ____________ ___ you, that's it." Q: But in the letters, they wrote, we know that you are Jewi sh and we know that you are homosexuals, both? A: Yeah. And that, my friend says never. As I told you before, I have a friend, she said to me, "Don't sleep at home any more, you come to my h ouse, you sleep there." For weeks and that was a trip from Schallatanborg(ph) , she lived in Friedenelle(ph), where that was, just a __ _____________. But thank God Emil had a car and he always drove me.

He say he ga ve him the passport and you know what he asked him? To pay the Nazi's 180,000 marks. Then you can have the passport. Gö ring. Boy I could tell you stories, you wouldn't be lieve it. If it didn't happe n to me I wouldn't believ e it either, but it's the truth. The God honest truth and it's not enough puni shment for them, that they should get what they did to innocent, wonderful, honest people like Kr onor(ph), a prince I tell you and those bastards took everything away from him. Everything. Conclusion of interview
