And again, good morning, Mr. Pizem, we're delighted to have you. Can you first tell me when and where you were born? Answer: I was born November 29, '30, in Primishlana. Q: And where is that located, where at the time? A: Presently, it's located in the Ukraine. Before the war, it was a Polish city, belonged to Poland. Q: And can you tell me about your life growing up there? Can you describe your parents, to begin? A: My life was a very pleasant life. I grew up in a very bourgeois family, to say. We live comfortable, until the war started. Q: What did your parents do as a profession? A: They had real estate, land. They were welloff. My father didn't work. He was a religiousoriented man; he was a rabbi but he never practiced. So, this was my home. I had a sister, Esther, and I have a sister, Ida Biesenkarcher (ph). She's alive. I survived the war with my sister and my mother. Q: What languages did you speak at home? A: At home? Polish, Yiddish, combination of both. Q: And was your home a lively environment? A: Oh, yes. Q: Did your parents have friends over? A: Oh, yes. Q: And what did they do? A: We lived in a big house, a lot of friends. I was a child so I was not familiar with their social life, but yes, people used to come to us . Very often my parents took me with them up to some neighbors, friends, relatives. You know, typical Jewish life in the prewar shtatle, I would say it is. Q: So you had relatives in the area? A: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. I have two uncles in the city, I have distant relatives there, had an aunt in another city, but not far. The city was Gleanyani (ph). Sometimes we went to visit them, they came to visit us. What can I tell? I have a very happy childhood until the war. I had friends, we play, you know. Q: And did you go to school? A: Yes. I went to a Polish school and started the first grade, then the war started, so I wentthe Russians came. Fortunately, theyotherwise the Germans would be there in '39. Later, I went to Ukrainian school. Q: Uhu. And it was a shtatle school? A: Yes. Q: Not a Jewish school. A: No, no, no, no, no. Q: And there were boys and girls in your school? A: Yes, yes. Q: And were they treated differently in terms of expectations of work or home responsibilities? A: No. It was just ano, no. What do you mean by treating differently? Q: Were boys expected to work and girls expected to be home? A: No, no, no. No, no, this is notthis is your this is probably those more religious houses. No, we were a traditional home. So, no, no. Q: Did you have nonJewish friends? A: Yes, a lot of them. It was a very good, pleasant life. Of course, later I would thinkbut we will come to it. Q: We will. And you spokeyou mentioned your two sisters. A: Uhu. Q: Can you describe them a little bit more? Were they older or younger? A: Oh, yes, Esther was older. She was already graduated from the gymnasium. And Ida, my sister, was younger. They have a lot of friends. I mean by "they," I mean my older sister. She used to take me out, certain concerts in the city. I would say a rich social life. I didn't notice that my childre n have this here. You know, maybe we tookin retrospect, things look differently butbut life was very pleasant. We had everything, so we were properly spoiled because of that, but thisuntil '39 and the war, the PoleGerman war started. So Q: How religious was your family? A: Oh, my father was very religious, very religious. It was a very kosher home. Yes, my father was very religious. Q: If we could just go back. You di d bring the picture of your sister. A: Yes. Q: Can we talk a little bit about that? A: Oh, as far as I rememberI don't re membermy mothershe was killed in '43. Q: Your sister. A: Yes. Q: Esther. A: Yes. Oh, she went to gymnasium, whic h not many could afford, so she Q: And that was a private institute, sir? A: Yes, it was in Primishlana. It's Emryten (ph). Q: So this is hercan you tell us what this is, which card this is? This is her gymnasium picture? A: Yes. The name was ___________________+ Polish gymnasium. The name of Kveenyaveega (ph) in Primishlana. Q: I see. A: And those teachers whichI don't know nobody. Q: Do you know how old she was when this was taken? A: I cannot tell if this is my brother, becaus e I couldn't understand th e whole '33, '43. She was _________________+, but in '43, Jews couldn't go anywhere. I couldn't go to school, so this must be somewhere in between, or maybe somethingten year or something. But this was done by Vadel, a Jewish photographer. I knew him. I remember him very well because I used to go to him with my mother, my parents' pictures. But he was killed in '41 so I c ouldn't understand how this was madethis was probably made between '33 andbut notmaybe in '43. This is hard for me to describe. Q: Uhu. A: And I don'tI think this was a religious t eacher. He was Jewish. Yes, he was feshtop (ph); he's not alive. It seem s to me that this gentleman is also Jewish. Is he? Q: So there were both Jewish and nonJew ish students at the gymnasium as well? A: Yes, yes. Oh my God, and more Jewish. She, too, had the Jewishtwo other Jewish girls. I don't know. They got a picture from a Gentile and probably theythis is how they indicate the Jews who are not alive probably. __________________+ not been someduring the gymnasium was notthis couldn't be of them. Or maybe when this was done, maybe there's just indication of Jews. So for me, it's, you know I asked my mother and she told meof course , she knewshe knew the other one. She knew all the Jews there. Q: Your mother knew all the Jews? A: She know them. She know the teacher. She knew alsoI remember she mentioned this: Her name was Flusay Lord (ph). She was a Polish woman, a Polish teacher. But thisbut one thing is for sure, that Vadel couldn't have made this in '43. Was killed. And my sister, if this was in '43, she wouldn't be. Not only, all the Jews wouldn't beso it must be done, the picture, but the occasion, they couldn't come, in the sense. Q: Uhu. A: And being in Russia after the warfirst of all, we gotabout two, three years after we were liberated and then we find somebody who made a pictur e of my sister based on this one. So we have it at home, a big picture. Th at's what I can't tell about this picture and what her story. She was a very bright girl. She spoke English, she was planning to study medicine somewhere overseasoverseas in the West, not in Poland. She had a lot of friends. She helped us a lot from '41 to '43. She worked ; life was very difficult. And after our ghetto was liquidated, we were hiding immediately, and she was walking in the city, in the camp. It was not a concentra tion camp per se but it was a working camp. Jews and Poles work there. You ask me w hy she was there? She could have escaped with us but she was trying to retrieve some things for us to be able to continue hiding and living, etcetera. Me and my mother and my si ster were hiding at that time inby Poles, outside the city, and I used to go to visit her. I remember I visited her twice or three times. She couldn't visit us. And when I vi sit her the next time, I don'tthe third or the fourth one, she wasn't there, and I remember I was surrounded by Polish girls and Jewish girls. And I said, "Where is Esther?" And they saidthey didn't tell me that she was taken away, of course, and killed probably immediatel y there. Said, "She went to another place to work." And then I asked, "Can I come tomorrow and see her?" And I remember they told me, "No. If she come back, she'll come and visit you." Of course, in retrospect this was a preludium. It was painful for them, and I was beginning to cry _________________+ something. Q: Do you remember when the war began? A: Oh, yes, remember September 1, '39. Yeah, how well I remember it. Q: And how did other people react? How did your parents react when the war began? A: They act scaredthey were scared, normally. We knew thatwe didn't knowI couldn't understand that they would know what the Ge rmans are doing; they would probably run to Russia, from one part. For the other part, we were welloff, and the Russians sent many to Siberia. My auntmy aunt from Gleenyana ( ph) they were owners of a factory so they wereher husband was arrested, and my aunt and her daughter Arella was taken to Siberia. Unfortunately for them, they didn't survive thereno, unfortunately for th em, they survived but they came back in '41. They came back because my parents, many people around spoke about them very highly, positively, and they wrote to the Russian government that they were not for Bourgeois who exploit othe r people. Can you imagine that? In '41, they letshe came back, and her husband came out from the jail because of intervention. Couldn't understand how th isand of course he very, very happy when she came back but in two months laterin two or three months la ter the GermanRussian war started. If they would stay there, maybe they would surviv e. Maybe he wouldher husband, Mosha, would have gone to see them, but t hose ____________________+ she came back, unfortunately, for them. In '41, my father was killed, and my two uncles were killed, in November. The Germans cam e to our town in July. Q: What was it like when they occupied the town? A: It was very, very scary. The Jews were taken immediately, in a ve ry arrogant way. On November 5th, my father and my two uncles were orderedthey got ordered November the 4th by the Jewish Judenrat, the Jewishcame to the same place where my sister went. Q: Which is the gymnasium? A: The gymnasium, yes. Of course, at th at time there was not anythere wasn't a gymnasium. I don't remember wasI don't rememb er what. And from there, the same day, they took them to the woods and shot them. So this was the connection with the same place. Oh, of course I remember very well the Judenrat asked everybody to bring whatever they possessed, gold things, in order to buy them out. We were very naive, naive people, thought everything would ___________________+ but around 3:00 o'clock I was trying to run to see them butthe str eets were empty and ar ound 3:00, 4:00 o'clock they began to take groups to the woods in our city, Snutwasfada (ph). It was a very beautiful place. But the shooting was alrea dy going on, we can he ar this. And around 5:00 or 6:00 o'clock, women were cryingRoma, Romasand I remember that I wasI gottold my parents and my sister that I'm going toto the place of them, and I went. As a child, I well remember I hadI had the Aryan look at th at time, and two or three people more went to this place. It was already night. The Ukrainian police and the Germansmostly Ukrainianwere they went to the city to eat, to drink, and then they came back to bury them. Not they, probably, it was But then I went to the woodsI went close to the place where they were shot, and I remember that there were some cries of probably many people who were wounded, and I was scared and I run back, and I told the story to my parents, to other people there. So ot her peoplesomemostly, of course, Romathey followed, they run to this place, and they didn't came back. Th ey were shot also there. So I was lucky that didn'tso this was but prior to this my father __________ ______+. My uncles were taken to jobs to work. Q: They were taken by the A: By the Germans, the Ukraines, or by the Jewish police. They told them where to come and to do work. This was prior to November 5th. Then they were killed. Q: How else do you remember your life changing before November, when they went into your town? A: Oh, changed immediately. First of all, I didn't went to school. My Polish friends, still some of them werewe met, we play. Also, they went to school, so we have to meet after school. We didn't go to school. Soand we lived in the same building untilI don't rememberand then our building was converted to a Jewish hospital. Was a big one. So they moved to another place, of course, in a crowded apartment, not like our own. Q: So you were evicted from your home. A: Yes. And then in '42 wasI remember aktion, one of theand my grandmother was with us, and she wasshe disappeared. I don't remember, th ere were conditions, how they survived. She was all sick, and shewe lived in a house in a Gentileit wasn't the typical Jewish neighborhood. And there was a ga rden there and I remember you ___________________+ my mother, she went to the garden some. But we came back, she wasn't there. So, they took her. Q: Do you know what A: In '42I don't remember the monthwas a bi g aktion, many Jews were taken. But after a few hours my mother and my sister came back from somewhere. I was hiding in another place. Q: Where did you hide, do you remember? A: In a Polish neighbor place. They took me in. Q: Your neighbors took you? A: Yes. Q: Is that what you said? A: Because I __________________+ up to them. And I don't remember where my mother was hiding. She told me. It was the same, somewhere in a Polish place, by Poles. And they came back, of course. Life was already not typical, because my grandmother disappeared. My mother cried, I cried, we all cried. Q: Do you recall any other antiSemitic actions carried out by the forces at that time? A: Oh, there wereyou meanwhic h forces you have in mind? There was the killer group that they were called Einzergroppen. They killed my parentsno, I'm sorry, my father, my two uncles, and they left _______________. and from time to time there were small aktion, and they came, they took Jews to work, the camps, etcetera, the camps that were around our city. This didn't apply to my uncles , to my father; they were not ready to life at that time, in '41, in '42. Then in '42 there was a ghetto. So they moved from this place to the ghetto. Our house was in the ghetto. Q: Which house? A: Where the hospital was. Q: Where you were moved. A: Yes. Q: Was located in the ghetto. A: This was located in the ghetto and this why they they made a Jewish hospital there. It was a big house. Because I remember once _____________+ they took the patients from the ghettofrom our house and they shoot them __________________+. I remember I saw some picturesnot pictures I saw, but then the dead were removed and this happened. This house was still considered the Jewish hospital. Q: So you lived in the hospital? A: No, I lived in the ghetto, another place already. First, we moved to athere was no ghetto immediately but when the ghetto wa s created, I moved from other house to the ghetto. Q: And where in the ghetto did you live? A: In the ghetto we lived in another house, we crowded with other people. There were aktions sometimes so we run away. And the final life in the ghetto was until May the 20th. Q: What was A: There were rumors that there will be aktions, but there were very often the rumors. We had connections before, but from the ghe tto we couldn't get out. But we had some hiding place where we lived, and when the aktion started I remember very well there was a kitchen. You opened the kitchen and through the kitchen we went down to a something, and from there I rememberI didn't participate in it but they built something inside, lower, and thank for thissorrywe survived because the Germans discovered the entry but nothing was there. Now they discovered but nothing was there, we were below. I remember it was crowded because all the pe ople from the building went down. And I remember my sister, we are sitting there, a wall of us on some soft things, and this wasand at night we went out, at nighttime, after being there one dayone day or two days, I don't remember. I don't remember; I lost cons cious there, but my sister put some soft things on me, with my mother. Q: Which sister? A: What? Esther, because Ida was smaller. Q: She was younger than you, right. A: And we came out. Was nighttime, the ghetto was burning, and some way we went out to a neighbor's _______________, in Spirtka (ph), and they took us in for one day. But they were afraid to keep us, and I understand. Q: And thesedid you know them before the war? A: Oh, yes. Even during the war, when there were rumors of an aktion, and we came to them, they let us sleep over, me and my sister. My mother went to another place. Q: And how did you geth ow did you get there at night, you said? When you were in the ghetto at this time, how did you get out? A: The ghetto was not surrounded already. Q: Okay. A: I assume. I assume it was surround ed before. Q: Uhu. A: But they did everything. They killed many people in the streets. I remember when we came out at night we saw someI saw some dead bodies, but this was at night. And from there we went to another place, through some connections, and they took us in for a few days. Q: And do you remember their names or where they lived? A: No, their names I don't remember. Now th e first name I remember: Bispertka (ph). But the other people who took us in for a few days only, I don't remember. And from there we went to another place, Sokolik, in Bo rochoff (ph). It's a village. They kept us for three months. Q: And do you recall their names? A: What? Q: Do you remember their names? A: Yes, Sokolik. Q: Sokolik. A: Yes. The grandchildren, they are there in Jerusalem, yes, fo r saving us. Not saving completely but worse time, not of them, we wouldn't be alive, we wouldn't be ablebut being there, very often we were afraid because the Ukrainian police. And I remember one evening they told us to get out, because there were big gardens there, and sit there, because they were afraid, becau se the Ukraine police, they're looking for Jews there. Not immediately, because they had a lot of work to do in the city, but after being there probably a month, at night they took us out a nd they suggest us to go into the corncorn, a lot of corn there, just sitting there. Q: In the cornfield. A: Yes, in the cornfield, me and my mother and my sister. Q: And at this point who was in hiding with you? A: What? Q: Who was in hiding with you at this point? It was your mother A: My mother. Q: And Ida. A: Ida, and Esther. Q: And Esther. A: Yes. After the ghetto was liquidated, when we run to those neighbors on the farm, my sister went tothere was a walking Kinder underway. Q: Do you remember the name of the camp? A: No, I cannot remember the name. Someno, just people were walking there, Poles. And my sister's intention was to go over there, which she did, to go over there to find some hiding place for us, because we were lost and, you knowshe know where we were but she couldn't go there. Q: How old was she at this time? A: I think probabl y 20, I don't know. Q: Around 20, yes. A: And I used to visit her fromand after two, three visits Q: When you visited her at? A: At the working place. Q: And where were you at this time? A: Already hiding. Q: Okay. A: In another place. Not in the city, already; outside the city with my mother. And sheI think once she came to visit at night also, once or twice. And that's it. I used to visit her a few times. Q: What was she working on at the camp? A: What? Q: What type of labor did she do? A: I don't know. They did some agricultural labor. Some of them went to work to the ghetto, to do some work in the ghetto, cleaning. And the a ssumption was to helpshe told us she would go back to the ghetto so maybe she would be able to take some things from our place where we lived. We had some valuable things. Not many, because the most the Germans took or the Jewish Judenrat took them. And my father and my uncles there, we thought that they would be able to take them out because of theto buy them out. Q: But she went back to se e if there was anything after? Had it been liquidated? A: No. Sheif she went to walk to the ghetto, she co uld have. If not, ________+ Q: Uhu. A: But she never went back to our place, she told me, and I believed her. I met her a few times. And then one thing, when she wentshe scratched her leg somewhere, unfortunately, and she had to bend it, and the Ukrainian police and the German came and they look they saw, and because of that, they took her out. I assume, but they maybe thought that she couldn't work, that she couldn't be so productive or maybemaybe theythey took a few people and they shot them. That's how my sister's end was. Q: That's how she died? Yes. But at that time we were already at Sokolik's place, in Borochoff (ph). Q: Can you spell Sokolik? Do you remember? A: Spell you? Q: Yes. A: I spell it in Latin and then inin Ukrainian this was like this. {Writing} This is the Latin name, Sokllyk [sic}. Michael. Q: So that's SOKLLYK [sic]. A: Yes. Q: And his first name was Michael. A: Yes. We were already in his place, and I remember they shootwhen I came back, shooting there all the time. At night then we can listen. And probably when I came back, when Ithey said to myI told ________, Sorry, I've trie d this, what can we do? And then my mother was a very energetic woman and she immediately, I remember, she said, All right, we have to live, I have toI hopeI belief you will survive, we will survive, and this and that, and she was verywe lived at Sokllyk's place three months. After three months, they were afraid. I don't blame them. Q: Did they hide anybody else with you? A: No, no, just us.

A: No. The woodsthis was familiar, Sokolik, I think because we were about three months there. May, June, July, maybe August, Se ptember, I can'tand we walk to Chemerenchi probably two, three days. We were afraid to walk through the street; we walked through the woods. My mother knowat night, I remember we could make it shorter but we saw peasants. The peasants at night havethey used to take out their horses to feed them, and they wereso we were afraid to cross them. So my mother find other ways. It took us three days to came to Chemerenchi, to the woods in Chemerenchi, which my mother knew them. And my mother told us, You sit here in a place and I'll go to the village. Was a very risky thing but shewe never __________. Of course at that time, didn't think those terms. And as soon as she left us, we he ar, Hello, hello?

And he told her that my mother's aunt is in the woods with her children and that my mother shouldn't go, she should stay here, she should wait, he will come back and he'll take us to the woods where they all are hiding. Because this wasthe woods was just close to the village. And my mother came back, and ____________ I was scared very much.

Q: And you livedwhere were you living with them? A: In the woods _____________________+. Q: How did you live in the woods? A: This is a question which all Americans cannot understand, will probably not understand. In the summertime, it's all right. In the wintertime ______________, how can I tell it? They call it _______________________+. A big yard, we cover this and we lived there. Q: You coveredsorry, what did you cover? A: We covered this with earth, the top, becausewe covered this _________________+ not to look like a place where people are living. _____________________+ live there. Q: It waswas it underground? A: Yes, this was underground butof course it was undergr ound, otherwise couldn'tand I think my mother's cousins, they did it for us. And we lived not far from each other. And I remember sometimeonce there was aktion. Shooting. The Germans, I don'tUkrainian. I run away, disorganized. My mother was different places. My sister Ida was with Bronyah (ph). I was by myself somewhere. I was so close to the German, I remember he passed by, he almosthe could have hit me. A nd I always think about this. I said for my Q: Where were you hiding when he A: In the woods, yes. This was all the aktion in the woods, he passed by. I remember he was breathing, and maybe he sa w me and maybe he doesn't wa nt toI don't know. I don't, but this was I remember. And my sister Ida was with Bronyah. They catch some people there but fortunately, nobody from our family . And in the evening whenever they came back, and of course we were happy to see Bronyah, my mother's cousin, and they're all alive, and Ida, and I was soit happened a few times, where aktionas, as they call this in German, aktionyou know this. In Polish, oblava; in Russ ianthey're looking for people, for Jews. Jew hunting is another word. Q: Who else were you in hiding with, aside from your cousins? A: There was some other family from Primishlana. I don't know them; I don't remember them. But we were hiding not together. Everybody separate because we were afraid. Sometimes you come to each other. There was another questi on of food, because in the summertime immediately they told us what we can find in the woods. Q: Who told you what you can find in the woods? A: Oh, my cousins. Said, Well, goyou find __________in the woods or you have to go outside, steal potatoes, because outside the woods. And of course they went to the village because they friends and some Poles, Ukraine but mostly Poles gave us food, gave food to Mommie, but you cannot goMommie went once a week, twiceonce a week, maybe once in two weeks, I don't remember, because it was dangerous to go to the woodsto the villages. Q: And did your mom receive food from former neighbors or friends, or did she she know everybody? A: No, sheyes, she got food from _____________, who used to work for us. Because we had a lot of land there and they were workin g the land; they had a nice life on this. So Mommie know some of them, she went to them , but she was afraid to go towe never know. See, their way of thinking was proabl y maybe we'll take over their lands, I don't know. So sometimes, you know, very often my mother went to and bought some food, some potatoes, some bread. I remember one ve ry unpleasant thing where my mother went out and she came back. The dogsshe was bitten by dogs, her legs veryblood and this and this. But she brought food. And this was happen during the wintertime, and when we came was already probably September, Octobe r, so we began to accommodate for the winter. Mushrooms we used toin the woods so lots of _______________+. I learned to distinguish good mushrooms a nd bad. We make the fire. The mushrooms were very tasty; I will never forget the taste. The hunger properly combin ed with taste with something to eat would create a good taste. And this was the life in the woods. Always afraid, always half naked. Q: How did you stay warm in the winter? A: In the winter? Q: Uhu. A: Inside and _________________+ got no water. It wasn't wa rm. In the winter we had somenot a cooking facility but something was made to warm with. And also, we had in the winter someI don't know how it was co mbined. My cousins did it. So we can ___________some water. Not cook with, someth ingit's unbelievable. We are hungry always, and there theand lice. And the lice. How we survived, I don't know. But then spring came so it was little bit better, easier. I remember the winter, I went out some break some food because we were making some fire inside this almost _______________ just like _________________+ I went out and came back. The same day my mother did, my sister did the same, Ida, wa s a small child butthe three of us were lying, covering each other, and this took a few months untiluntil June or July of '44, and the Russians came in. Q: So you had been in the woods A: Almost a year. Q: before that. A: Yes. All time in the woods that couldn't get out. And we had also my aunt who came back from Siberia, I told you, she was with us also in the woods, a separate place, and with her husband. I don't know why and what happened. She became sick or her daughter became sick and they find their hiding place in the village. Some Poles, they took them in, also the Bairns (ph). And shortly after they took them in the Ukrainian policeor I don't know who came, this what we were tolddiscovered him, took them out and beat him to death, evendidn't kill them. They beat he r, her daughter, and her husband to death. They werethen they were buried somewhere not far from the place in the woods, I don't know where. We were looking with my cousins to find out their places. Yes, and during hiding in the woods there, we had ot her events with my cousinMenda was his name. I don't rememberfor water, because we didn't have water. And suddenly we heard something: Rachela, Rachela. I will never forget his name. Somebody was calling Rachela. It's a Jewish name. And I don't know it was a _______ ___________ as a child but I was already and adult, everything that life make you. And I said to Menda, Who is Rachela? He said, No, this is not Rachela, it'sproperthey called the Jewish name, they want to come out some Jews, and we run back to our place. And later the next day we find out that there was a Jew hu nting on the other part of the wood and they catched a few Jews. This is their tactic: When they catch the Jew they always say, Callcall other Jews, if they found a name. But this was forthey didn't callshe didn't call our name or other names. She called Rachela, I rememb er. And Rachela was not among the hiding places with us. So they went away and didn't come out. But were many such things which Q: Did youdid you constantly hear the German and/or Ukrainian forces around you? Was it almosthow often did you hear them in the woods while you were in hiding? A: Oh, very often. Q: And was it bothdid you see them? A: No. No, if I saw them it wouldn't be the best thing for me. Yes, from a distanceI remember I wasthe woods ______________ a nd sometimes I want to go out. Not from the woods per se, but as I'm ____________ in the woods, just to walk liketo run. And I knowand then we notice somebody is coming, two or three people, far away, so we run away. I don't know. They were probably maybe looking for Jews or maybe for ______________. Yes, very be often, uhu. Q: How did you find water? A: There were places where we go after rains, dirty water. This was very often because there was no water close to this place ________________+. In the wintertime we used the snow and melt the snow, it was no problem , but in the summertime water was a big problem. Q: What was it like when the Soviet soldiers liberated you in 19in July of '44? It waswe had shooting all over. We had rumors thatartillary shooting from far distance and we thoughtwe always hoped that it will come closer, because the Russians made a big move insomewhere in January, and they stopped in March not far from us, about 200 kilometer. It was another German line of defense. This was in ___________________+ And if they would go a little bit further, my a unt would be alive, other people would be alive, but it didn't happen this way. And when the Russians came in we didn't know, realize, shooting ______________ ___+. Then some Poles then contact with us, came and said, The Russians are here, we can go out. We were afraid, we didn't trust, we didn't know. Q: Who told you, which Poles? A: A Pole from the village, he know that we there, somebody that used to come to us. And we came to the village and we saw Russian soldiers around you, and in _____________ we want to be closer to the soldiers. You know, my mother saidI cannot remember it was a Jewish office r. She thought they were Jews. Q: In the Russian Army. A: Yes. Not only one, but a few of them. And of course they were very good to us and they asked us aboutand immediately they feed us because we are hungry and we are dirty. Q: How did you know how did your mom kn ow they were Jewish, the soldiers? A: They know that we are Jewish. Q: They knew that A: Yes, we told them. Q: Okay. A: And then I remember a Jewish doctor cam e, and there were many Jewishthere were a few of them there. Of course they immedi atelyI don't remember. They settled us and two peasants not far from the place where th ey were stationed, and they thought the peasants would take care of us. Of course, we were not afraid, we thought that the Russian are here, that the Germans are not here, but we were deeply mistaken. The Ukrainian killed many Jews, those who survived, immediately, for differentfor certain reasons. First, for maybe they _______ _________________+ but we survived, and we were surrounded by the Russians. They gave us some clothing, they gave us food, they told us not to eat a lot, I remember; they gave us very small portions because some of us died immediately after one or two days: It was swollenI was swollen likemy mother was swollen. So the doctors immediately, I remember, they check ed us, they told usand they gave us a bath, some _________ clothes and there were awe were a few days there. And we ask, How about Primishl ana, can we go back to our c ity? They said, No, the city is still not taking baths. A few days later Q: Did youdid you speak Russian? A: Yes, we spoke Russian but because we lived under the Russians two years already. Q: Uhu. A: ________________. And they told us that the city will be taken by us, _________________ to the city, you cannotthey told me, Don't walk to the city. That was good advice, otherwise we would be killed. But because the village which we were was consist of twos parts; one part was t ypical Polish and the other part was Polish, mostly Ukrainian. The Ukrainian part was very dangerous; we didn't go there. But after the war, many Poles were killed by Ukrainian there. During the Germans, and even after the Russians came in. So when the Soviet army began to m ove further, so they took us to the city in their car. Q: The A: The Russians. Q: They took you. A: The officer, the soldiers. And of course they was fightingwas fighting but I don't know, fighting wasn'tfor me, I was happy to see the fighting. I remember when the Russians were close, I went in the woods with another guy, boy like me. We saw the fighting, shooting. Fortunately, the Germans didn't went to our woods when they were beaten, but the Russians did. So they went in different streets, in different ways, the Germans. But we saw them from the woods. Q: I just want to make sure we're on the same track. A: Disorganize everything. _________________+ Q: We're good. No, that's okay. Do you remember A: Do you think questions could be more precise? It would be easier for Q: When you were in thewhen you were in the woods and y ou were in hiding, do youhow aware were you of the war and what was going on? A: Just by rumor sometimes, from the Poles, and my mother went to the village. Nothing, no, nothing. We became ve ry more when the front was closing. Q: When the Russians were coming in. A: Yes. And was artillary shooting, flyingthi s wasotherwise, nothing. Like wild animals withoutbecause we always hoping that the Russians would break this, this, we listen to their shooting from __ _____________ you know, the ________ house. Q: Do you remember seeingyou said you sa w some of the shooting when you wereafter you were liberated. A: No. Me shootingthe war between the Russians and Germans Q: Right. A: Yeah, sure, mutual shooting, yes. The artillary shooting we can see from theit was a pleasant vision. Q: And then after you were A: When we came to the city, because we had to have house, couldn't go back. I remember I saw the dead bodies and myand they were shooting in the hospital. Blood on thebut there were many empty apartments. Q: And this was the hospital that you saw with all the dead bodies, which housethat was your A: This was our house. But we didn't go back there to live, no, no. Q: But you saw it. A: This was there. And the Ukrainians were already living there, people were living. It didn't bother them. So we find an apartmen t in anothera Jewish apartment in another place and begin to look around. I remember the city wasthe ghetto was destroyed. The city was completely different, the people weremany people from the villages came to the city so never knew them. A few of my school friends, neighbor friends with whom I used to play, they find the life good. And then immediately the city calls for ______________not to take care of us but we didn't ha ve any papers, nothing. We couldwent to neighbors' places to find some thing, pictures, nothing. This picture was given to me later to us. We didn't have documents so we have to establish birth certificates, who we are, what we are, school. And I rememberoh, yes, when I was in the wood, I remember my mother taught me _______________ I can write and read, but I didn't have what to read. But math a little bit, soand of course I missed four years, three years of school. So I came backso they gave us tests. Q: This isthis is after the war? A: Liberation, yes, after liberation. Q: After liberation A: In Primishana, yes. Q: And before you reentered school would you sayhow manywho did you know else that had survived? You said some of your school mates. A: No, not many survived. I know we met, like I told you, my aunt, thosesome other people, another Jewish __________. About 20 people there in the city, I would say. Not families per se. A family consists of one person, two persons. We were the only one family which survived three people of us. Q: Your family. A: Yes. Oh, and another family from the village, from the same village, survived probably five, six people, which probably they survived from the Booth (ph) family. But from the city some people came, began comi ng back from Russia, one, two people. No, no, the city consists probably at that time from 20, 30 Jews. Q: And so then youyou movedwhere did you and your mother and sister go exactly? A: We got apartment. My mother began to work immediately somewhere, I don't remember where, because she has to make it to live for _______. Some neighbors gave us something. Nobody gave us back any clothing becauseI don't remember. But we got some clothing from people, otherwisewe coul dn't buy, we didn't have money for what to buy it. And I remember I was very eager to start school, to see ______________+. And there was a Jewish teacher in '41, Leekman (ph). He wroteso he survived the war. He was teaching me after the war immediately, because he gave me some privatenot private _____________________+. He said, Rubin, you have to go to one or two classes higher; you will make it. And I don't remember which grade he put me in, fourth or third, I don't remember. School was difficult. I was very often hungry in school. Q: What did you do for food? Your mother was working. A: Yes, Mother cooked. __________________+ But still, other people, I remember they came to school with sandwiches that _ ___________________+. I didn't have this. Q: So, were there Jews and nonJews again? A: What? Q: Your school had both Jewish and nonJewish students again? A: No. Most nonJewish Q: Or there weren't many left. A: Jewish students were me, my sister, one ot her. I would say seven, eight Jewish kids. Q: And how were you treated by the nonJewish kids? A: Not so friendly. Not soyou see, they saw what had been done to Jews so everything came out from this. Of course, I played with them, played soccer, but they don't invited us to their homes, nothing. In the beginni ng. Later, two, three years later when we growwhen the senior class, a little bit closer, but you felt some coolness. Because the biggest mistake was that we didn't left immediately for Poland. And now I will tell you why. When the Russians liberated us we became soI thought I'm a human being, I thought I'm a normal person. Some of our people, even my aunt, she left forrun away because her sons were taken to the Russian Army. And those who had people in the age you could be taken to the Army, they run away to Poland. This was officiallylegally, we have to apply for permit to go to Poland, which my mother did. I remember she filled out some papers. And the post office wasn't working so well but I don'tand we were told that we should send this to Schw orchoff (ph). We send it, to get the permit to return to Poland. Because at that time we knew already that this would be a Russian Ukraine and Poland would be Poland. Of course, we feel more comfortable in Poland. But we never got the reply, never. But my mother could have tried to go without some papers, which wasshe was scared probably. And then some rumors came that in Poland, their pogroms, which was through, and so my mother called up, said, Herethere are no pogroms here because the Russians are here. And this was whenbut then we went to school and I don't knowwe were happy with the minimum that we have. But if we woul d go to Polandfirst of all, life in Poland for Jews was much better. I'm sorry. And from Poland, as we learned later, we could be trying to go to Czechoslovakia, to Vienna, to Israel, because Russia was close. Poland wasand besides, the Poles closed their eyes when Jews left also from Poland. My aunt, with her two sons, left for Poland in order for them to avoid the Army. In Poland, they were _____________________________+ because they were of draft age. So they left for Czechoslovakia, and from there to Germany. I don't know if it you know the story, that this wasprobably the Israelis arra nged those things for them, I don't know. But they left Poland after one year of being in Poland. It was a pogrom in Krakow, too, so Poland was also not the best place to be. But compared to Russia, was a wonderful place. And we lived in Russia until '57. Q: And youhow did you begi n rebuilding your life there? A: Rebuilding my life, I graduate from high sc hool, applied to law school in Lewolf (ph). I was not accepted to law school. I worked a year in a law office in my town because I was interested in law. Not based on some re adings about it but, you know, inside I felt so much hate and I was thinking maybe I'll be able __________________ __. I liked law but in school, I gotI wasn't accepted.

I will sure that I will look there. He came back and he said, No, you're not there. And, How about you? And he said, I am. I said, How come? I had better grades th an you. He said, You're not there. I said, Couldn't be. The next day Mommie gave me m oney, I bought a ticket with a bus. It was a few ruble, but for me it was aand I went to ______________ university, and I don't find myself in the students, in the group who was accepted. I went down to the official, and I said, How come I'm not in th e list? What's your name? And I said, My name shitle. You're not in the list of the university. Why I' m not there?

But thank God that they accepted you there, because they didn't accept many at all __________________________________ they're not oblig ed to accept everybody who applies, and they are not obliged to accept everybody who passed exams. Of course, if youa similar story happened with my sister Ida. She applied later to Lewolf (ph) University, in the department of journalism. Smart girl.

And in Moscow she was accepted andbut she came home and she has to work, we cannot make a living with my mother. And she worked in the newspaper.

I don't remember ______________________+. And then I brought my grades from the German departmentvery good. It was easy to transfer when you are already in. Q: How did you feel about bein g in the German department? A: Veryvery uncomfortable. But I wasn't the only Jew. There was six Jews of us. Only two of them applied for German, because on e was a daughter of a Russian officer who was in Germany. The other was something. Me and somewe were outsiders. I didn't feel comfortable. Can you imagine? But in history department I feel much better. But then when I was there I noted that there are no Jews there in the university. A very limited, especial in those socalled government type departments like law. After lawafter law here, you become a lawyer, you can __ _______________+ Here, I'll get you in.

Q: Did you live in an area where there were other Jews that had returned? A: Oh, yes. In Stretchen there are a lot of Jews at that time. But many Jews, they're leaving for Israel. We couldn't leave i mmediately. The Polis h _______________ were there for 10, 15 yearsnot all of themwere difficult. They leftsome of them left for Israel; therefore, we got their apartments. Otherwise, would be have to buy apartment, would be impossible. So they probably left, es pecially ___________________+ the other came from Russia. Was a mishmash. And I got the job and I made a living. I could live, could pay my rent and mymy mother didn't work, but she was broken. She _________ with a stroke in Russia, then she ______________________+.

We applied for _______________, but Israel stayed the same. Summer, ___________ to be applied to the United States. Q: Wait, what do you mean by Israel? What happened when you applied to Israel? A: We wait. We never got the reply. Always gotalways a negative. And we know the reason: I was young, I was in a teacher position, and my sister was also young. They didn't let out the young people so easily from Po land. They let them out easily in '67 and '68, but this wasI left before th is. I wouldn't wait so long. But __________________________________+ they were most leftoriented Jews. We were not, my mother was. We were rich in Pola nd. We thought maybeI don't know, I cannot consider myself this group. Fortunately. I didn't wait for this. In '65 or '66 we gotwe gotwebegin to got some correspondence with American embassy. No, it wasn't so simple. Q: Why did you decide to leave Poland at all? A: No, Imy motherPoland was a cemetery for me, and my mothermy mother different. She was right, in retrospect. I had a good life in Poland, social life, working with different friends, adults, and Poland was free, can listen to the Voice of America in Poland, and it was a different life. And besides, when I was in Poland my aunt _______________________________+ in Israel. Q: Uhu. A: I'm sorry, in America. And one of my friends was also in America because he hadhe hadhis mother has a brother in America. So they immediately came to Poland, and then from Poland they went to Germany, and they left immediately to Americaimmediatelynot in a year, two later. So my aunt, they used to send us money to Poland. Not to Russia. Medication for my mother. And so Poland was a good life for me. To give you idea, in Poland, when we came for ___________________+ a month you can live comfortable. I made $30 a month in college, 40, I madebecause I worked at a fulltime job, and then I worked with correspondence students attwice a year they came _____________+.

I was jumping from place to place. Q: No, it didn'tnot at all. This has been great. You will have to Q: Well, I want to know what happened, though, when you came to the U.S. What happened? A: Oh, yes. The U.S.I came to the U.S., and, we lived in The Bronxno, first I came from Poland. My mothermy mother was in Israel.

Because she was an invalid the Polish government paid her pension, and of course I tell herI told her, Mother, do youand my sist er left for Sweden a different way, not legally but forand from Sweden she came to Israel. So my motherso my mother went to Israel. And II couldn't leave law the school year, so my mother, I remember, left ___________________+. And I had to wait then till the school year. But I didn't have a permit, perm ission to live Israel.
