So they had to find a place where the--the ghetto could only--there was at that time, in Kovno, was about, I would say, around--30,000 Jews when the war broke out and I think you probably know the percentage--maybe 3 or 4 thousand of these survived in concentration camps and so forth. So, so the time my parents tried to find a place where to live and so my wife and I and her parents. So scattered my uh wife and I found everywhere were some relatives and my parents found some other place and my father and mother in another place and finally eventu- ally later we joined up together so but the--but the situation the city was terrible. The Lithuanians use to grab you's who moved into the ghetto moving around and they use to take him to the different river by the Fort. We had several forts: number 4, number 5th and number 9th Fort. So uh this is all Russian Fortresses where the under the Czar they built it for military purposes. So the before we moved to the ghetto. We didn't yet moved to the ghetto, they built a fence--a barbed wire fence and I participated in building the fence too; dig holes and all that; they carried the lumber and.

What happens when they ask for a hundred or thou--or thousand people to be killed. The life in the ghetto was not easy. We lived in very crowed conditions because that time it was late summer so it uh we didn't need any uh heat in the house but the rations that they gave us were meager but whatever people tried to prepare food for what they call the prences my mother would play the piano. So my mother--we were not allowed to take musical instruments into the ghetto so she sold the piano to some Lithuani- an family and she use to work everyday. Jews were not allowed to take any public transportation. Unless horse and wagon if you could find one. And they uh, she walked many many miles everyday carrying bundles of flour or potatoes or all kind of stuff she could get. Sold it and money they--they couldn't do nothing with money anyway. They didn't have a value with money.

There was a dead line when women can bear children. After dead line, babies had to be aborted. But my baby didn't want to go through it an abortion. And the baby was born after the dead line. But the papers regis- tered in the ghetto records, it was born before the dead line. It was born--the baby was delivered by a mid-wife because my wife knew what from the hospital, she was an excellent mid-wife. The next morning out beared the placenta in the back yard. And I didn't witness but I time, I heard the birth of the baby but I uh the baby looked healthy and you know it was fine. But the baby didn't know what is what he was what kind of life he was coming to but the little. So the baby was born I would say October the 42--something like that. So when the baby was killed he was about 2 and a half years old or something like that.

They had to take some old clothes and make it--cut it down and make fit for a baby or uh shoes--it was very hard. I think that people here who live in the worst economic conditions in slums, things like that, had a much easier way to raise baby then it was in the ghetto. And you know, here we spoke Yid- dish. Everybody spoke Yiddish. And they spoke a lot but German. You know when he started--the baby started to talk and understand a little bit, he use to say, 'I'm afraid there's a German. I'm afraid there's a German.' In Yiddish, he use to say it. And he--and I built an underground he--to hide ourselves because we thought--we knew that the war is coming to an end and the Russians are coming closer. So in a couple days we could hide over here.

You see they didn't have enough uh guards to guard us from--there was a shift--was a shift--there was a thousand people they use to go work, you know. They need almost a--a regiment of soldiers to accompany them because there were so many Jews and so many soldiers guarding--like that. So they wanted to build barracks at the airport. They should live in the airport. Women separate from the men and work right there. We had a family. We didn't want to be separated, so if we got--I tried to use the influence, what I had from my father in law, what he knew very important people and says uh. As a matter of fact, I wanted to become a policeman when the ghetto first started. I was not accepted. You're too educated for it. We need rough characters you know.

So I was accepted and they uh--and they gave me a--a job with the to be at some ghetto shops. Where they use to bring uh German army uniforms to wash them and clean them and mend them and--and so it was like a plant guard. So that was that. That was easy. You worked for 12 hours and 12 hours you--you go home. So that's how I became a policeman. Until--until the day when they arrested the Jewish policeman. I have to give--the reason why they just--the Jewish police. That was already 19 forty...end of '43 and '44, when the ghetto was converted--instead of a ghetto and a concentration camp. When the S.S. when they became the head of the ghetto. See before they had was they--they--the district commission of the S.A. was the member but then the S.S. took over. That's why the concentration camp had the Daskimblovia or Gulka maybe that his name. He was a uh S.S. colonel. So uh--so you figure--so why do we have policeman--yes there was an underground movement. People use to go into fights you know--fight the Germans, the Partisans and then of course, a certain people the police knew about the underground movement but the guards wouldn't here a thing like that. So they called the police that par- ticular day--that was in a--that was the day of the uh--I think was in March 1944. That was the took the children and old people away.

He was later dead--he was brought you know. We knew who he was. He was also policeman. I says, 'What happen to you.' They beat him up because they all before the war, his parents owned a very elegant fur shop. They use to sell their furs and before they went to the ghetto, he gave--they gave their furs to some Lithuanian people they know and so she couldn't go out of the ghetto and they were gonna pay them back with food--I think like that. So sometimes she went to the walls and they refuse to give them more food or money whatever it was. So he says--she says she is going to complain to the Gestapo about you.
