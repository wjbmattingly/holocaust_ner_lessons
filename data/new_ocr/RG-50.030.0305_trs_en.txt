Solomon Radasky January 23, 1995 Q: If you would please tell me your name, where you were born, when you were born? A: My name is Solomon Rodashinksy. I was born and raised in Poland, in Warsaw. My birthday is May 17, 1910. All my life I was in Warsaw, the whole family. I come from eight people, six children, three girls and three boys and my father and my mother and the rest of the family, my father's side was six brothers and three sisters. My mother's was two sisters and three brothers, so we had a big family. Over there, I figured out after the war how many people is alive, I never find it to now nobody. I was looking in papers, conventions, I was going in 1981 and in 1993 the Washington D.C. and then in 1985 in Philadelphia. There was a convention I ever missed, _______________ I advertised through the radio, through the television, through the _____________. Still now I get some papers from the ______________, they ask me to find somebody and until now I never saw a person pointing their finger saying I know you. There was 78 people including nieces, nephews, all of the family, and I'm the one alive. I ask myself many times why, why am I alive? But, maybe God leave it me to be alive to sometime say the way I am and what I am and that's it. Then in 1940 Yom Kippur day, it comes out they're going to make a ghetto and that ghetto don't take too long from Yom Kippur to November 15, everybody had to come out and where to find a room. It was very hard. Some people never let in, but later on they did it because the Jewish section around Warsaw was around and we found a room of less in __________, the street. But there was on the ______________ one room, six people, my mother, my father, three sisters and I who were the six. I think one of my brothers there. We sleep on the floor and the winter time -- and Europe's winter time is not like here, a little day like yesterday morning you say oh it's cold. I say it's cold too, because I'm already 45 years here in the United States, but the life was very, very hard. Until they come into the ghetto. The ghetto was so terrible, people were laying in the streets. Mostly the people were coming around from around the small towns behind Balsa. The Germans throw out and make it the third _________. The third ______________ means any people can't live around in this town, the third ______________. People with little children, they're in the street every morning we saw the dead in the corner. When the Jewish commander _______________, that means people would come and pick up the dead people in little hand trailers and bring that to the cemetery and the cemetery had no place. They made big, big holes and they put in 100 to 200 people and they covered it. No food. So, when I'm talking about, I see the picture from my eyes what happened there. There was a young guy, his name was Rubinstein. He was no crazy, he made it crazy. He was running around in the streets, I have to say a few words in Yiddish what he said _______________________, that means we're all the same and the fat get off, so it's no one higher than the other one. And he knows to who to go and ask for money. You got a cat, give me money. Give me five ____________, like you say here five dollars and if you're going to give me I'm going to holler _____________ and we got scared. Everybody give him, he got a full cap with money, he go around in those sections with the poor people laying in the street with their children and take the money and throw it, ____________ and they grabbed the money and bring the money again, just money. He 2 helped those poor people in the street. This was not help too, of course. There come a time 1942, July 22, the ______________ about 2 o'clock signs in the street who wants to go to work and get two bread. Our bread at that time, our bread is not like you got it here, a pint, a bread is a kilo. A kilo is close to two and half pounds. People pushed one into the other one. Everybody like to be the first to get the bread. The first transport as 20,000 people. They don't know where they're going. Nobody don't know but the president and the Jewish commander his name was _______________. He hid a man, a Pollock and he paid him money to follow the trains with 20,000 people and that Pollock took that money and never came back. The next day he did the same thing. He gave another Pollock the money and follow it. He never came back, but Treblinka is not too far from Warsaw, is 120 kilometers is like 80 miles. The third day comes a young man blonde, he never looked like a Jew and he took off his arm band and put on a cap like the Pollocks used to wear with the leather, and he said 80 years old the guy is, all but 6'2" tall and he said I risk my life. I'm going to follow that train and I'm coming back. I don't want no money and I'm coming back and I'm going to see what's going on and he followed and he was coming back and it was told Mr. ___________ this and this place, Treblinka is a crematorium. The people coming down in the trains is no selection like they make selections in other camps, it is no selection they tell them to get off their clothes and they tell them they're going in to take a bath, and they cut off their hair, everybody, the men, the women and they shave their heads and they're going in a shed, they close the door, outside in the corner there is a man who brings down the switch. They bring down the switch and it pumps gas. He heard that and the people were hollering, children crying and a while later, he said they come in and they're taking out little hand trailers, put it down and bring that to the crematoriums put them in the ovens. He told this, Mr. __________, when I speak many times about this, I tell their story. To me the men did a big mistake. He's supposed to say for the public what's going on. There's no where to go any way, what you know. He did it. He called his whole family, brothers, sisters, brother-in-laws, uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces to his house and closed all the windows, the doors, and put in all the ovens the gas, and they killed themselves. The next morning we find it out with a note what this is and they're all dead. They're dead, nobody can take their life. They come in and take that way and they were going the same way the others were, the same way. That time, the organizations the __________ communists other ______________, allies got together and seen to protect what they can protect. __________ but Pollocks used to come in the ghetto, they don't suppose they smuggle in themself. One bring a few potatoes, one bring a bread, and he asked you want a suit. We give him our suit and they give us bread. Whatever he wanted, we give him. He asked not for money and the people got clothes and they got in contact with the Polish side only risk was some of them take the money and they bring a gun and they bring a rifle. They bring some bullets. Some of them say no send me the money. How can we send the money. There was little children, 8, 10, 12 that break the fence from the ghetto, it was a brick fence and the evening as soon as it's getting a little dark those children were going over on the other side smuggling. They used to buy some bread, potatoes, carrots. Early in the morning, six o'clock in the morning when we can walk and get daylight, they're coming back. With their children we're sending all the money and they send the ammunition and they bring ammunition and many times if they send the children through the canals, the drains in the street, the drains in the street was dry because when 3 they used no water, there was nothing to cook so there was no water. It should have gone through the drains and canals in the street to the other side and bringing in bottles with gasoline, and we make bombs. Fill a bottle with gasoline and cover it with a piece of rag that's coming out and light and throw and this was a bomb. Q: Were you involved with this? A: No. Q: But you knew about it? A: I know that, but I would have been but I know that. Not everybody was to know that, but I know that. I was even maybe three kilometers, three kilometers is over two miles because my shop was in a different street and as so we got organized from bombs, ammunition, hand grenades, rifles, you know, and the time was coming. I was a __________________. The Germans got two shops. One shop was the name Schultz and one shop was Terbantz. I was in Terbantz, three kilometers away, let's say like three miles. One day a guy came and said he saw my sister by Schultz. I say you're sure. He said you know I know your sister, the youngster. I said yes, and I say how can I go over and see? I'm locked up here, I cannot go out on the street. He said I was coming with a German and I'm going to stay there over night and if you want he's going to take you and he's going to bring you back, but it's going to cost you 500 marks, like $500. I say okay, I give him the money and he introduced me to the German and the German tied my hand with a piece of string in the bag and I'm in front of him and they're behind me with the rifle and he bring me over there to Schultz. I come over there and he give me the address and I look and my sister is not there. I asked people that I used to know and some of them said yes she was working today. Some said they didn't see her in a few days. I can never find her. It's coming five o'clock I have to go back and the German soldier said to me we cannot go back. I cannot come back. I said why? He said you don't know? I said no what is? You bring me to the gate, to the fence, he said look out, do you see what there is? I said yes I see man soldiers there around this is what tomorrow morning. I said what do you mean tomorrow morning. He said all the Juden are going to be dead tomorrow morning. This was the 18th of April. Q: What year? A: 1943, I stayed over night as soon as daylight was coming in the morning we hear a song. The Germans opened the gate and come in in the ghetto and singing that song all the Jews are going to be dead today. We looked down there and we see in the meantime comes out three soldiers, officers, the lieutenant, a captain and looking like the Germans were walking with their hands in the boots and their head high and stopping. They stopped and one from the three asked the leader of the group where are you going. We're going to kill all the Jews. You got a paper to show something. We don't know nothing. No, we don't have nothing. The major is outside. They turn around and come back they don't know nothing. They turn around and go back they started to fire. Fire was coming out where the building I was 4 before, demolished, half from the bombs. See nobody in that time we killed all but two hundred soldiers inside. The Jews started the uprising April 19 and I was there because I was not going back. Hundreds were probably killed but the Germans saw that we be strong, but one thing we never got, we didn't have no airplanes or they're throwing out higher bombs. They got that. They started throwing out the bombs with the fire bombs and this was about six weeks we were fighting. May 1st was quiet in the morning and I was going out taking a look and I got a shot in my right ankle. See my right ankle, I got the shot right there, through here. One German saw me I fall down. He was coming with the rifle. He hollered stand up and I had to stand up ___________________, they bring me to the _____________, you know what the _________________ is? No more ____________________ now. I come to the ______________, the train is mostly full already with people to go to Treblinka. Well, they pushed me and they throwed me in. I come to Treblinka. That train stopped they say they can not the 20,000. They can take half. They took the half but my luck I wasn't out of sight. I was going to Maidonek. Q: Did you at this time know anything about Treblinka? A: Yes, I told you before there president ________________ Q: Yeah, but you said he didn't tell anybody? A: He left a note. He left a note and then killed himself and his family and left a note about Treblinka. That's how we find it out. Q: So you knew what Treblinka was? A: Yes. They cut the train in half and I was going to Maidonek. Q: When was this? A: 1943, May 1. I was in the ghetto until May 1. From the 18th to May 1st. Q: Can I just go back a second? A: Yes. Q: During the few weeks of the beginning of th e uprising in the ghetto, what were you doing? Just hiding? A: Everybody was hiding. Special people that organized to do something there because they were scared. They were scared to trust, maybe spies, civil spies, Germans. Even they know me, no we have no place for you to help. When we need you we'll call you. There was organized. They were fighting six weeks. When the war started German met Poland not even less two weeks. Why? Because there was spies, give over the telegrams to the Germans 5 where to find the bombs, where there were houses, and where the railroad tracks and everything, not even two weeks, and they fight us, they fight six weeks. Then the history and the war, the six weeks they give up many, I was in Balsa two years ago and I seen in _________ a tombstone but it stood where he used to live ___________ Street. My wife used to live on that street. I saw that tombstone, and it is written in Hebrew and in Jewish and in Polish, his name. My wife used to know the man. Q: How did you know where to hide? Where did you hide? A: Like I say before, I was lucky. All my family dead, I'm the one alive. There were many people that survived the _________. There was no place to go. We go into the bunkers. There were many bunkers. There were bunkers made onto the ground. From one street to the other one for two miles and the Germans found them out and they destroyed the bunkers with the people.

When I got and that was on the ground, those bunkers from all the way from street to the other one and they find it and they throw bombs there. The whole Warsaw is destroyed, 85 percent destroyed. I was there two years ago and I don't want to go there. My daughter used to bother me to go and I ___________ when I was coming there to _________ Street and I take a look inside. I didn't want to go no further, not one house. Everything is destroyed and the barracks the Russians put up barracks four or five floors and the Pollocks come, there never was so many Pollocks there and they got in the millions there not in the thousands, in the millions in the street so many cars, they park in the sidewalk, they park in the cars. I was coming to Maidenek. Q: Okay, I was just wondering if you could tell me a little bit more about your life before the war, so can we just go back and then we'll get to Maidenek. When you were living in Warsaw, I want to know a little bit more about your family life. You weren't married before the war? A: Yes. Q: Oh, you were married. When you went into the ghetto your wife was with you as well? A: She was, not too long. She was all the time with me until 1942 to __________________. One day it was in September and October was a selection and they took out all the people plus the people that were in the shop. I was in the shop and that was in the house. It was supposed to be that people were in the house working the night shift and they want to know who took that evening. A man, a German officer, he was running the shop and he told the people from the night shift and they said you get us some others and they say I don't have it. They say that's your problem and took them, all of them to Treblinka. Q: So, when you came home for work? A: This was in the same building, they left ten minutes later all the shop we go down there and 6 saw nobody was there. Even was a lot of children was too. In Europe the houses are not like here. The houses are built in the ground a cellar and then build up the houses and we put together a few cellars and we hid over there a woman which worked in the shop with children. On the other side, we put in some water to see when the commandant says something is broken from the pipes, water on it because you cannot get a plumber. But somebody who had a big mouth said on the other side there is a woman and children. We'd like to find it out and we can never find it out who did it there. Who did it there we just think it was the police. Q: The Jewish police? A: That's right. The police had a big mouth and that did it and those Germans knocked off that wall and there were people who were going out -- they had to close the water and they got wet and it was a very frozen day, and snow and they have to go through the water and walk through the ______________. I think many, many was fall down there and it was a far way to walk to the _____________ place where we were. Q: Did you have any children at that time? A: One child, two and a half years. Q: When you were working at the __________ plant what kind of work were you doing? A: We used to make jackets from lambskins like the ________jackets, the short ones. We used to make lambskin jackets like that because Europe is very cold. Some jackets like this we used to make gloves and caps. Q: Who were you making them for? A: For the Germans. Everything was for the Germans. Every day so much had to be ready. Q: Do you think because you were a furrier that this bought you time because you could work well for the Germans? A: Yes, that's what saved me. They never touched the men from the shop, just they look in the houses, the private houses. We used to live in the same building. Q: The same building you worked in? A: Yes, the same building. Q: So you couldn't go back to your home? A: No, the same building. We never saw the street. In the morning when we're going out to the 7 shop or work at night they come down in the morning, six o'clock, six thirty in the morning I got back in my room, sleep until 3:00, 4:00 in the evening. Q: I'm a little confused because you say when you first went into the ghetto you lived with your family and there were many people in one room? A: Yes. They started the ghetto. This was in 1940. At that time there were no shops. In 1941, '42 they organized the shops, before they opened the shops we were scared to walk in the streets because they grabbed people in the street and some of them never came home. To clean the snow from the railroad tracks, work in the street, this started this was later. This started in 1942 when Treblinka opened up. Q: How did people get chosen for work? A: Well not everybody can get work. You have to be -- when you say you're a tailor you have to be a tailor. There was a tailor shop too. There was in the same street, but our shop was the furrier shop was a big university, a big building they make a tailor shop. When somebody registered a tailor is going in and working and he didn't know how to do something. He never come out, why he never come out was a man, a German. His name was __________, and he was coming mostly at night. He was coming and checking, not in the day. When somebody don't know how to work was working at night because the production was made in the day that people that were really tailors that know how to do it. I'm a tailor you know I work in the day and somebody's not, I make the production for him, for the man to be alive. And that __________, he used to come at night and he was I don't know how to call this man this, this man was a monster. You see, the material goes on the table laid down there about this high, maybe higher and they put it on a stencil and chalked around with chalk, where the sleeves, where the front, where the back and took hold of that. Usually you got electric scissors and cut it through there. There they got the knives. Put it on their knives and cut it straight in the chalk and cut it all through the material. That's very hard to do. That ___________ used to have knives with him he took it and he used to know who was working and who was not. He used to come in and look and throw the knife straight in the chest. We used to know when he came we took some people bring them down in the bunkers and hide them. He was going to the bunkers and find them and kill them the same way, with the knives, thrown the knives in the chest. It was thrown. Q: It must have been terrifying? A: You have to know what you're doing. If you sa y you're a furrier or a shoe maker, fixes shoes, you got a lot of shops but you have to know the work. Somebody was going in there maybe he knows some people there to help him bring him in to save his life, his life was not sure the day or the night when he got killed. When he got out alive, he was lucky. Q: Tell me a little bit about the ghetto life and the Jewish consul and all of that. 8 A: The Jewish consul there is nothing to say because nothing can help them. They're getting no help. Where can they get help. They never used to get help from nobody. They never used to get it. The people themselves had to help them. Like I said before, we risked our lives and we saw a common end in the ghetto. We asked them, you got a bread, you got a potato, come on I'll get you something. He say, what, I'd say I got pants, I got shoes, we give up our shirts, give up everything, give away, because we got some money but they didn't want no money. They got a lot of money before when the Germans occupied Germans in 1939, they robbed all the stores and there were some very beautiful stores, shoes, suits, ladies dresses everything, sections. They robbed right away. They come in the shop with the Germans, you there, he got this and this. Streets, ________________________, all of those business, nice ones, good ones. What kind of stores there were, everything sections. Not stores that got this, this and everything. Mens clothes is men's cloths. Men's shirts and underwear is men's shirts and underwear. They used to know. They used to come by. So, we had no help. You had to help yourself. You risk your life. We had to ask you come on give me a piece of bread give me a few potatoes. Just to make the day to be alive. Q: Were you able to get over to the Polish side? Did you do that? A: No, I didn't go on the Polish side. I had no business to go there because I know that I used to have was robbed. I bring with me a little bit, I sell there and whatever I can make, I make it. Q: But that was for people who were coming in? A: Yes. Q: Now, life in the ghetto before you were at the shop all the time, tell me about it. A: Life in the ghetto, I was going out in the street, they grabbed me to work. I was many time they take and grab me to clean up the snow on the railroad tracks and then they would come a day when I was coming back and I was luck to be coming back. I know the sections and how to handle it a little bit. Because I used to have some fur with me and carry it around. One time I sell a Pollock a little jacket, a seal jacket, and the Germans were a way and a few weeks later they arrest him in front of the police they ask him where he got it. He told my name; he told my address. When I come home in the evening two policeman one a policeman and one a civilian, wait for me and they arrest me. I said for what. They said come on. I come up to the police station and first of the civilian started to beat me and he said in Polish, they said you dirty Jew. I say for why, why are you beating me. Tell me what you want. I did nothing wrong because first of all I'm scared and I don't know if I'll come out alive or not. I want to know. He said you sold a seal jacket to a man, where did you get it. I said let me see if it's mine or not. Yes, I sold it because that was my wife's and I got that little child and they have nothing to eat and I sold that and I didn't sell it for money; I sold it for bread. He bring me two breads and some potatoes. I can recognize mine because I make them. Then he give me a paper with a pencil, I want you to move it down there how you can 9 recognize your work. I wrote down I can look down inside the lining, what kind of lining it was and I take the paper with the pencil and I wrote down that the lining is made so on and so on to look nice. He brings it in, and I said this is not mine. This is not mine. He said it's yours. I said it's not mine. You told me to write down to give you how it was made and now I got the paper and look if that's the same thing or not. Well, he started to beat me again. He said I want 500 slotas. I said I don't have it with me. I can bring it tomorrow. He said if you don't bring me tomorrow you're going to be dead. I'm coming out and I'll arrest you and you'll be dead. I said okay, but give me a pass to pass the gate when the Germans stand. He write me down, he said 12:00 you be here then I will wait outside by the gate for you. It was a nice day and I will bring you 500 slotas and that's how I was free. Q: So this policeman was a Jewish policeman? A: No, Polish. The Jewish policemen were inside in the ghetto. There was a big man. I'll never forget him. My ___________ got killed through a Jewish policeman. 1942 in April he's gone to the wall with the children coming back and they brought our bread and our Jewish policeman saw that and he called the German and says stop that Jew he's got our bread that little boy. What happened to that little boy, I don't know. I think they killed the little boy too. He shot them in the back. He shot them. In 1941, wa a time to give away all fur coats, all the gold, all the diamonds, whatever somebody had. We give away and one day I come from work I come in the house and I see my mother and two sisters dead. They took Riena, they wear black uniforms going door to door around and seeing them coming in and ask to give the furs or gold or whatever and they said they didn't have it, they give away to the Jewish commander. They didn't want to believe this to they look to see if they can find it, and they killed my mother and two sisters. They killed them in the house. Q: Through who? A: Through the Jewish police. The Jewish police were showing them where to go, which houses. Q: Were they ever helpful? A: To who? They were helpful to themselves. They were helpful to themselves, not to nobody. Many people got killed in there. Q: Was the Jewish consul any better? A: To tell you the truth, I don't know who was the Jewish council. We never got nothing to help them. Nobody send in to the ghetto to help, which consul send in? No consulate. The whole war, nobody helped us nothing. Q: What I was asking is I thought there was a Judenrot. 10 A: The Judenrot did nothing but for themselves. If they got us something, they took away for themselves. That's all. They never helped nothing. I don't know from where they get the help, from where they get the help. The United States never helped nothing. The other consulates, which consulate can help there, but not the United States. Q: I read that in the Warsaw Ghetto, at least in the beginning there was a lot of activity. There was a lot of schools and concerts? A: That was special made for the Germans. They make some concerts. They took the nicest cafeterias and tell people to get dressed nice to come in and bring some ____________. They're playing, dancing and to show them the Jews in the ghetto, look how they're living, and this was propaganda. This was lies. It was propaganda. You read, there was propaganda from the Germans. Q: So the Jewish community didn't organize their own programs? A: The Jewish community never got nothing to organize. I remember not I remember, I saw with my own eyes a man get a way a hole in the lining, the material, that time they're going to buy before the war in normal time, it costs maybe 2,000 slotas and 2,000 slotas was a lot of money. In side there, at that time, he give away free bread, a Pollock did, he wanted somebody to buy it he can give 5,000 slotas. It was no help. End of Tape #1 11 Tape #2 Q: What else can you tell me about life in the Warsaw Ghetto? A: What I can tell you? Q: Every day life, what you did? A: What I did, the same thing. We just hoped to be at the end to get out of there. We were thinking, every day it just got worse and worse and worse until it comes the end. The end was to get out of the ghetto. 1943, April 19 when it was the Warsaw ghetto uprising. That was the end. Q: Before that was there regular selections or deportations? A: This was something everybody was hiding, not to go and get caught. Somebody get caught and they're never coming back. I thought yesterday ___________, he showed me a number which is close to mine. I got a number 128,232 he got 128,203, you know very short, but I asked him when you got the number. He told me he was coming one day before the Auschwitz, and from where, he was in 1940. In 1940 they grabbed him on the street. They grabbed people on the street like they sometimes come and get dogs on the street. Someday like that and they send him away. He told me where he was. He was a hundred times dead and he was coming out and then he was coming the same time the Auschwitz driver was coming. Q: Were there class distinctions? Did some people live better than others in the ghetto? A: No. I used to have a home with three bedrooms. Three bedrooms is a six room house. That I have to give up five rooms for people. And you can imagine how they live in the ghetto when I've got a house with six rooms and I have to give up five rooms for people, and people bringing in their own people and they lay in the street and then they take our bed and change their clothes. The life was very, very terrible for us. Q: Was your house, your house before the war was in the area where the ghetto was? A: No, no. I had to give up the house and go into the ghetto. Give up the house and give up everything, not even the old clothes I had. I left them. I used to have a _____________, I watched my daughter two years ago and see them in Poland and I saw what the Pollocks robbed a mahogany desk and I told her see I used to have a _____________ like that. I used to have a bedroom and a living room, furniture like this. The whole world you cannot see furniture like that mahogany furniture. Q: So you had a nice life before the war? 12 A: I was good off. I used to have a Polish girl in the house when the Germans were coming in and she was going down the ________, a young girl, very beautiful, and talked to her and she said she worked for a Jew and she knew where they are hiding some _____________ in the cellar. She bring them in and they come in with the truck and they took out everything and I had to run away. I ran eight kilometers. I stayed there for three days and then I was coming back. I was lucky that I got a shot when I was running. The bombs the bullets everything falling. See, there was nobody to trust. Nobody to trust, especially you thought them to be the police they want to show off who they are. This was the trouble. Maybe it would be a little better. Maybe it would be better to get something more to eat, but of course the Pollocks were coming in and they wanted to help, only they wanted something. They were robbed themselves. When we go out after the -- the 19th of April I saw there's nobody there from our family and then I was coming from concentration camp. I was coming from Maidonek with my leg and I got a bed, I laid down I see a man comes over to me and asks me the way I came. He saw the limp and I showed him my leg and I told him he said I can help you but I cannot help you with no medication. I said well, first do what you can. First I am a doctor, and he took it out a little pocket knife. He took it out and he operated on the leg there. I was lucky they give me a shot, it was a long time, he said this is going to help you and he helped me cut it up and make bandages but I had no medicine, no medication nothing. But I say I can do it. Help yourself, I said what can I help myself, excuse me the next person say you _____________ and that's going to help you. The next morning we go out to the appell 5:30 in the morning and I look around and I see a few guys I used to know and they tell me everything and they said how can you walk out of the gate. When they see you limp they'll take you out. When they take you out they're going to hold you until the evening when we all are coming back, and you see the kitchen there, yes, they're going to be hanged. I'm in trouble again. Well, I say, one says okay, come on then in the middle. He moved out one and you stay in the middle and we're going to try, we'll go close to you and we're trying to cover you. And they'll try it, and I walked out and I was coming back the same way. What was the trouble outside? Outside was the most trouble than the inside. We gathered the wooden shoes there, and we come outside we had to take off and got the two holes in the bag, one got a piece of string to pull it back together and put it on the left shoulder, not the right, the left shoulder and walking backward and they grab you. They grab your coat, the skin -- many people found and they shot them and put them on the side and when we're walking back, we have to bring back the dead, carry back the dead because by the appell in the morning they count out 200 that they are coming back 200 the same way, dead or alive, bring them back. The end of the day I get better in the leg. It was nine weeks in Maidonek. Q: Now were you working every day with this bad leg? A: Yes, I go to work outside in the fields. Q: Like digging? A: Digging and we were bringing out some trash. It was very, very dirty work. Dirty work like 13 dirty work, but to be nine weeks not to have my shirt to change, not to get a bath, nothing. Excuse me for my expression but the lice, it was terrible. Not just from me, we had 1,500 people in that barrack all of the same. Until when I was out on the 22nd of July he come, an SS man and took it out three groups 750 people, where are we going, we don't know. We were glad to get out of Maidonek. Maidonek was the worse concentration camp there ever was, and Maidonek is in history the worst concentration camp. They were talking yesterday, about Auschwitz and Birkenau, I didn't want to say nothing. Many people know that. It was written one time in the papers, in a magazine how Maidonek was the worst concentration camp in the history. Q: Why? A: They treat people worse than animals. They didn't need to kill people. People killed themselves. Rows and rows of ____________, 29 factory from _______ and they had two boys that were Fins and they were with me in the same lodge and then were coming a young man, his mother and father were in the shop at ___________ with me. He had a big ____________________. The name of the business was _______________. Their two boys, the Fins, and his father and mother was in selection that took away when I explained before there that it was in the cellar where she was there. She was gone there. He obeyed the business with a building and that product was a good friend before the war and they say he's going to save him and his son. The son is going to Treblinka and I'll tell you about the daughter and he said yes. The 18th, the evening, he walked over from _____________ and it wasn't to far.

That guy and the two twins hanged themselves in barracks, the same night they took out the bells. Two young boys and an 18 year old boy. The older three they hanged themselves. Q: Did you see them? A: Yes, they bring them out in the morning to the appell to the counting. 1,500 people in one barrack and dead to live everybody had to be counted out the same day and then we go out to work. People got killed we had to bring them back and lay down there and they have to come, the dead. When I was out, when the SS men took the three groups, the 750 people and my group was staying and I didn't make the five and I was in the second 100 and the second 50 the officer there was an appell that come to seek out a big holes. I remember now when I look at the holes. A black holes with a white striped nose and the legs have, all of her legs have white and he was lighting the hose around her everyday by the appell. When the officer took us and we would stay separate, the other two groups he took away the same 14 thing. One group is gone and digging stones and the other group is gone making ammunition. Only he was looking and see he comes over and colors dogs, why he colors dogs, because they were wearing metal numbers on a piece of metal with a piece of string. I remember my number 993, I remember my number and he say do you smoke a cigarette and watch and tell me who smoked a cigarette and if not I'm going to hang dogs and I'll give you three minutes. We're not supposed to move nothing. A whole day in summer in July in the heat, no nothing, and we cannot answer nothing for three minutes. It took not three minutes. Started the whistle and bring out the bench with the robes and everything and he comes over and he got a whip like this with the silk that you throw on the animals. He gathered the first two fifths rivals. Nobody wanted to go first in the bench. No blind fold or nothing, they have to put on the rope themselves. I was in the first three. Turn around and we gathered the ropes. The rope was hooked in and to kick away the bench and the first three to be hanged. I muddle by and he hollered, the officer hollered halt, halt, that means stop. HE comes over and says what is that. Smoking a cigarette and they want to say we're hanging dogs. He said who is there dogs. A new group, 750 people. You're going to hang 10 dogs? I cannot carry ten dogs dead, turned them loose. He started beating, his type already to pull them out in their position to open them up. We're very excited, we don't know what to do. Well, we survived. He beat us but they come down there but we're supposed to stay the next morning but he took us the same night. He took us out to the railroad and we stayed in that train there and the next morning we left, a day and a night and we was coming to Auschwitz. We were coming to Auschwitz and we see coming in ________________, the sign is still there. I saw that two years ago. Well, the 750 he made the selection and he took it out 300. What was the 300, the 300 was already, they were not able to work. There was frozen, the face, the legs, they can't walk. People run in, he never saw them. He said 150 they started to go and everybody wanted to get out of Maidonek. He bring some soldiers with machine guns and it's in Auschwitz they called it the Birkenau. Over there they killed 300 people. No gas chamber, no shower, no nothing just like that. Q: How did they kill them? A: With machine guns, and took them away. Q: Tell me about your arrival at Auschwitz? A: Well I arrived at Auschwitz, the first thing I was glad to be over there. Yes, I'll tell you why. I got other clothes an I was going to get a shower and a shirt and underwear. A little more in Maidonek, I'd hang myself too. You can't even get to the toilet in the morning. Terrible, so that camp I never saw all that many but this one was worse. When I was coming to Auschwitz I can go in and they cut off my hair and I get shower and wash me up. Once in nine weeks, ten weeks, I feel like I'm newly born. But later on, I got some problems. This was a difference. I got some problems. I was the first job was I was digging potatoes from the ground where they cover them for the winter, not to get them frozen. I had all the bad ones that were frozen were going for us. The good ones were going for the SS. That's what they tell me. If you didn't find one good potato between there, you'd be hanged, that's all. I 15 was working there a few weeks. The second a few months, after there from every Sunday I can be shaved. If I'm not shaved until 12:00 I get no soup. I have to be shaved, my face has to be shaved until 12:00 and 12:00 they're bringing out the soup. Any man not shaved cannot get it. You have to be shaved to get a little bit of soup. If not I'd have to wait until Monday 12:00. Sunday evening if you're working you get Sunday evening a little piece of bread. If you're not working you get nothing, just 12:00 the soup. The barber was a barber like me. He says he's a barber. He got a knife and cut it. From the water, the water was not clean and I got an infection. I got an infection but they stopped me and one time took me out of the line and I was going to the hospital. I stayed in the hospital maybe eight ten days but I was lucky the men there was in the hospital he gave me a little mirror he said that's one thing that can help you. You're not going to get another one. You can die here and you're not going to get another one. Be careful because I want this back. You pull out of the hair as much as you can. Pull out and then the infection will be better and take a little water and I was sitting for days and pulling out hair by hair and that's what helped. I was six or seven days in the hospital. Then I was coming out, I got another job another block, block six. Block six, I come out and I see some people coming from work and some young guys where they used to come in 1942 _____________ was not finished. Behind in the _______________________ 76,000 that number and one comes over to me and asks me where are you from and I told him and they said oh tell me about the Warsaw ghetto uprising and I told him all that I can, how we were fighting in there and he brings another two guys, he brings over and the one asked me where, I told him what are you doing. Do you know some people in that business, I said yes. ________________ they say yes and I called them by their name, and when I said I called them by their name no one believed me. He said their name, how did you call me, I said yes I tell them how they called them. I told him when I saw him on the last day in that I told him that guy is going he got the left ear, he was born with that little piece that was hanging down and he said how did they call him by his nick name, I said they call him ____________ because of his ear. When I saw this, I got one in a way in a side and got a piece of bread this size. One bring me a soup but it was cold. It was good soup. One of them ask me one of the piece of paper where they give you you are going to work. I have to go into block two tomorrow morning 5:30 in the morning. I see the piece of paper, I don't want you going over there. I said why. You're going to be going into a coal mine. Yesterday I met a man who was working in that coal mine. He was working in a coal mine, and he is -- and they say no you're not going, and I say if I'm not going I'm going to be hanged. He said nobody is going to hang you. Give me the piece of paper. He pulled it down and went away to the kapos and talked to the kapos. He had the connection with their friends in their own town. They was working and they can organize something and they bring in the kapos, the kapos they changing, the kapo was for their job was not ______________ are criminal. A young man, 6'6" tall who weighed over 300 pounds. The face when you look into his eyes you don't know him, he's a murderer. He was the kapo of us. But this room where I was and that boy is make him good. Then he saw something he don't like you he killed that boy right now. I saw one time he took a guy when they used to come and he took a shovel and hit him in the head and he killed him. He reported it that somebody ran away and nobody can say that it is lie. Everybody won't say they were lying. The kapo is telling, take him, let the commandant in the morning and I was scared. I was 16 how I can go out to pass the gate when I got my numbers here. They said you come with us. We're going to save you. You going over there eight ten days you'll be dead. You cannot make it in a coal mine. They covered me and I passed in the morning and I come back in the evening and I was working the whole time until the end with those guys. My job was ten people we were digging __________ and bringing it to Birkenau twice a day and we covered the ashes. When the ashes were coming out from the crematoriums. The crematorium and in the back there was a little hole there and coming out the ashes and there was a big two holes to get out and we were covering them with the _____________, we were covered with ashes. I showed my daughter the crematoriums in Maidonek and I showed her the ashes because in Birkenau you can't see, it's demolished everything. One crematorium is just a little bit there. You know it's a crematorium but you cannot see nothing. In Birkenau and Maidonek all the crematoriums and gas chambers is in Birkenau and I was showing her how the gas chambers and the crematorium where the people were going into the ovens and the ashes come out in the back and I was covered in Auschwitz. Q: This was kind of a unique job. Can you remember what you were thinking as you did this work? A: Yes, sure. When I wasn't going to another job, maybe I was there a long time because I got out of here and the boys were saved me. They saved me not to go into the coal mine. I know to myself if I was going to a coal mine I was going to be dead. The condition that I was, and that helped me. They gave me some kind of piece of bread. They give me some time a little soup. Q: Were they working with you? A: The same group, ten to fifteen people that wer e coming out there in the fields was divided. One time they come and they say you can make a cape for a kapo. I said yes, but I have no material, I have no needle. I need a needle and thread ad scissors. You go and get everything and when they bring me there and I say to one, look I have to take the measurement to make the cape. But I was scared to go up and talk to him. He said don't worry. I will take the measurement. I said I have no tape but I can take a piece of paper and take it around and that's what I need. We come out to work in the morning, they bring me in to the toilet and he was coming in and he looked and me and he ___________whether I hear what he say and I told him to sit down because he was tall, 6'6". I told him to sit down on the toilet. I take a piece of paper and I told him to take off his cap and make the measurement. He said that's it, I said that's it. I can make the cape in two or three hours but I worked two days, in the same toilet every day. I was sitting over there for two days and I made him the cape. He brought me in a piece of bread in the middle of work and I made him the cape and he looked at that. I hope he still has it. He was very happy. Then he don't touch me. He never beat me, never, for eighteen months I was working for him. He never put a finger on me. Q: Tell me a little bit more about this work, because you were doing the same work for a year and half? 17 A: Yes. Q: Did you see a lot of people coming and going? A: I see men were coming out of Birkenau. We saw the transports coming, people coming in transports. We saw and we saw the selections, left, right. 1944, I think it was April or May was coming a transfer, 10,000 people from __________ Budapest and ______________. Those people never knew where they were going. They lie and say they are going some place and it would be changed and for other people they were going to work. They're bringing with them fur coats and all kinds of things and food and we asked the guard there, bread, we asked you see what there is. This is not for us, this is for you. You don't smell the steam that comes out from the chimneys? Yes, we feel it there, that is not for us. People said okay. They give us a little piece of bread or crackers, no we need it for us. Later on when the selections, right, left, they realized the first group is going on and to see who comes out of the shower and who does not come out, they realize that. ___________________________. That's all from there. This place is not for us. This place is for you not for us. One time I think there came a group a mother with her daughter. A beautiful girl I see her with my eyes. Beautiful, young, beautiful and they separate the mother from the daughter, and the daughter started to cry and she run back and the first man grabbed her by the hair and throw her over there. And she run back to the mother and she cried and she said I want to be with my mother. Wherever my mother goes I want to be with my mother. They told her your mother is going to the gas and you're not going. She said yes, I want to go. And he grabbed that pistol and pulled it out, he shot her. The selection was made and they put the ghetto back, the whole 10,000 and they killed them there with machine guns. Q: They killed everybody? A: Everybody, all the 10,000, and this girl was the first. Q: Did you see this? A: I saw it from far away. I was watching. Q: You knew it was going on? A: I used to know every day what's going on there because I was coming twice a day. Q: Were you working at the crematorium at the time there was that uprising?

One time it's coming out and a man speaking a few years ago and he got a slide and he showed this is a slide and this and this girl and she got hanged for the uprising. I said the other girl, I don't know nothing. I said well, you got the one slide and you don't know -- and I told him all about it. He said, oh, I have to look it up and see there. Q: What were you aware of? A: You see when they were hanging somebody the whole camp cannot go in the barracks until they have seen for themselves the hanging and talk around it why they get a hanging and for what and everything. The two girls were hanged in the camp for women. That's in Auschwitz, not Birkenau in Auschwitz because they used to work in the ammunition factory. They organized some ammunition, but one crematorium, they damaged one crematorium. They got the gas chambers. Q: What were you aware of when this going on? A: What? Q: Were you aware of what they were doing? A: Yes. Q: Before the hanging? A: No, we find it out after. Find out after, see what happened. Nobody don't know what's going on. Just the six people the two boys and two girls, nobody else. Even inside in Birkenau _________________ even in there they don't know nothing. Those four girls and those two boys they organized their own with nobody's help. There was no nothing before that. Q: Because you were working near the crematorium, did they isolate you at all from other prisoners? A: No. Q: But you knew exactly what was going on over there? A: Yes. Q: So they didn't try to keep you from passing information to other people, nothing like that? A: No. They were coming out, we used to know the news in the evening and if anything happened any place we used to know in the evenings when we were coming home from 19 work after the appell.
