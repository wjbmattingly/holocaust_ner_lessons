JERRY SLIVKA June 15, 1990 Q: Can you tell me your name please? A: Jerry Slivka. Q: Where and when were you born? A: I was born July 11, 1915 in the Western Ukraine, which was at that time Czarist Russia. Q: Jerry, can you tell me something about your family? A: Well, uh I...my father was born same town. My mother was born in the same town and I had uh two sisters and two brothers. My father was a uh I don't know if you know what it means...kind of a muscue (ph)...it was a moder n, self-taught Hebrew scholar. He also had like myself had the affinity for languages, uh nat...nat...natural ability I should say, and he, before the war, before the 1st World War, he used to teach uh the Polish children of Polish nobility who lived in the Ukraine, were the the owners of the large estates, the Poles, and he used to teach their children Polish. Self-taught...himself...taught himself Polish and German, and he also was a Hebrew teacher. In those days it was a very rare thing to teach modern Hebrew, because most of Jewish education was the _______, religious schools. He was one of the first to pioneer, taught modern Hebrew. Q: Tell me about your childhood as you were growing up? A: Well I grew up...uh when I was born...I was born during the sec...1st World War, in 1915...the war was...the the front was standing in our town for about a year so Sov...the Czarist Russia and Germans. That sector, that section of the of the front, it was manned by the Austrians and it so happened that Hungarians...the Austra-Hungarian empire so there were lots of Hungarians there too, and Germans. Uh when I was about five months old they evacuated us to the rear, the Germans did. The...at that time it was the Hungarian, the Austria-Hungarian army, and we were uh from 1915, beginning of 1916, we were about forty, fifty kilometers in the rear on this of the of the front. There uh in 1917 my brother was born and in 1918 when the war ended, we came back to our town. Uh the town was almost uh totally demolished and there was nothing to do there, so my father moved to the nearest town which was called Povorsk (ph). Uh the Polish government was just established. Poland became independent in 1918 and my father knowing Polish got a job as the mana...office manager in the Polish uh county county seat. That way he worked for a couple of years till the Poles started settling that that part of the country, because there were no Poles, very few Poles there, and they got a lot of Polish-speaking Poles and my father was fired. Uh this was about 1920. At that time the new Soviet army occupied, advanced all the way to Warsaw. They went by us and uh it was a very difficult time because there was also many Ukrainian uh independence groups trying to establish an independent Ukraine, and among them were many bands of anti 2 Semitic uh armies. There was Batura (ph), and there was Bela______ and there were many others and whoever went by uh the Jews were their victims. The pogroms there were...you know...uh but somehow we survived and in 1920 the Soviets were pushed backed from Warsaw...the the Poles call it to this day the miracle of the ________, and uh we became, Poland became a normal so-called democratic country. It turned out afterwards it was not democratic for everybody but was semi-democratic, and we lived there until 1939. Uh in the beginning it was not as bad a country as being built. Uh my father went into business. He was not a good businessman (laughter) (cough). He supplemented his income by doing some bookkeeping and writing petitions to the Polish courts in Polish because the majority of the population were Ukrainians, of course, and Jews where we lived and they needed somebody to...there were a few Polish people that knew Polish, so he used to supplement his income by writing petitions to the to the courts or any other Polish authorities. I grew up uh in this town till about...when my father lost his job before that he he went...he became a teacher in the neighboring town where I, we, where I was where I was born, and for several...for about a year or so I stayed. I was three years old and I already started learning something and my father was a stickler for for education. And uh I stayed there for a year or two. I missed my...it was only twelve kilometers away but it might have been (laughter) you know the the moon. That's that's while, you know, didn't have any cars or we went by train which then you had to walk six kilometers or went by horse and wagon, so it was tough and I missed my family though my father was there. One day I remember my father went for _____, went home, and he left me there and my...and and he took by horse and went to the nearest railroad station which was about six kilometers away and I I wa s probably four or five years old and I ran after the ______ realize it that he sneaked out I guess. He didn't want...it was expensive to go by train, see, but he didn't realize...to this day I remember it. I I resented it very much, and I ran after him into the forest. They had to go through a big forest. There were wolves in the forest but he...I was yelling, you know, and and he he heard me and he turned back and he took me with him. (Laughter) So I grew up in that town. Then my father went to ______as I told you before, and he didn't do badly. It was...he had a uh military garrison. The the the terrain around our town was swampy and and lot lots of forests, lots of woods and it was used for training the Polish army, so we used to do business with the Polish army. Uh my father used to have a uh beer parlor like, you know, which Poles used to come and drink. He also had a kind of a so-called department store-like which was probably twelve by twelve (laughter), but it had everything and we used to make a living from the...the Ukrainian peasants used to come and buy from us. Uh later on it was very difficult because in 1936 I think, _____ died, the leader of Poland who established a semi-dictatorship and since then the life for Jews in Poland was very tough. Q: ____________ we've talked a lot about Poland. I would like to know about you as a young boy growing up. What kind of schools did you go, what.....? A: Well, I went, as I told you before, first of all my father taught me. Later on there were others. When he went to business, there were other teachers. One of them particular 3 influenced my life very greatly. His name was Moshi __________. He was a modern Hebrew teacher. He taught me everything, you know, all...my my rounded education all in Hebrew, so I learned Hebrew quite well. Uh but it was compulsa...this was...this was schools were not recognized by the Polish government. They were uh...we, we ourselves organized them. You know, we used to hire our teacher and this was a small town, probably about forty Jewish families, so we we were compelled to to attend the Polish grammar school, which in our town went only to the fourth grade. In bigger cities it went to the seventh grade. And and and I was very advanced for that kind of education, you see, except in Polish, which I learned, but I mean uh math and all the other subjects I learned already when I was five years old. I had to learn ______, so I I....I went up through the fourth grade and later on my parents enrolled me into a uh gymnasium which is high school. Uh it was operated by the ______ network of Hebrew schools, Zionist Hebrew...Hebrew language teaching Hebrew uh teaching _____ Hebrew in ______, which is uh about thirty kilometers from my town, and I stayed there. And again I stayed with a family which was uh very crowded. They had two rooms with four kids and I was with them and my uh mother used to send me every week uh freshly baked _____, pastry and butter and all this stuff and I managed by myself as _____ so. I entered...I took an exam and entered the third class. This was a uh...well, this was high school up to the eighth...you graduated uh matriculated uh in eight eight classes. I entered in the third, but they were very expensive and at that time my father's business went down and he could not afford to pay and after a year my younger brother was ready to go to school. He wanted him to get a little bit of education, so I was...I went home and my younger brother, second brother, went to school. So my formal education ended there. I still had the same teacher we had before for about a year and a half, till about my thirteenth year, thirteen, fourteen years old and that was it. That that's where my formal education ended. I tried of course all the time to upgrade my education. I I taught myself. I read a lot and this teacher helped me a great deal. Uh at that time it was a very difficult...what do when you are fourteen or fifteen? And we had some , I had friends...well, my age probably we had a group of about ten kids, boys and girls, and we organized a uh group. Originally it was _____________, a leftist Zionist organization. Later on the majority thought that this was too too leftist for them, and we organized a ________, which was the revisionist group and then uh there was nothing to do in this town, so at age sixteen I decided to go to a kibbutz and go to Israel. So we went but at that time it was the most famous kibbutz in Poland called _____. It was a stone quarry where we worked. Uh not enough to eat, lots of work and I stayed there for a few months and then one of my friends tried to leave and he went home and while going home he stopped in my town. He lived a little further and he told my parents about the conditions in this kibbutz, very difficult. So they decided that I should come home. So they wrote me a letter where my mother is very sick (laughter) and I should come home. I came home, of course. Thank God she was not sick and I didn't go back. Besides you had to wait...it was not so much the hard work and the lack of food, but you might have to wait two years, three years, before you get a certificate, you know, to go to...it was then Palestine. So what do you do? Nothing. There was nothing to do in this little town, so my parents decided to send me to Warsaw. My mother had a sister in Warsaw. So I went there and my uncle had a little shop but I wasn't 4 interested too much in it. I don't know why and I couldn't get established so I went to Lodz (ph). Lodz was the industrial capital of Poland. Had a great textile industry and Jews were uh dominated the small textile businesses, uh manufacturing sweaters, uh socks, uh gloves, these kind of...the large textile mills, even though some of them were owned by Jews, had no Jewish employees. They had non-Jewish employees. It was socalled ________ which was owned by a Jew named Cohen (ph) who was, by the way, a Hasid (ph), a very religious Jew and there was _____ who built great factories for Polish people, but for the Jews he built a hospital, for Jews that could not work. There was strong unions there, Polish nationalist unions, even socialist unions were very much against Jews. So it was very difficult. I went to ___ school there for a few months and I learned making sweaters, and I used to stay there for a few months, earn enough to get a ticket to go home (laughter) for this...you know the season was uh summer. Middle summer and late fall and then there was no work. These were small...people that lived in one room or two rooms and had a...two or three machines, hand-operated sweater making machines. That's what I did for a few years and uh this was known...you know what _____ means? And that's the way life was till 1939. I came home in '38 and stayed till 1939. In 1930...by ________ went from ______, from the extreme right to a leftist organization called the AntiªFascist Front. I didn't know at that time that it was dominated by the______, the communist youth organization. Later on the Communist Party in Poland was uh dissolved by Stalin but this group...the the uh the Communist Youth Organization was instructed to infiltrate other organizations, regardless right or left. I didn't....was not exactly uh you know, convinced of communism because I was still, I still had Zionist inclinations. I couldn't understand why Hebrew language which was near and dear to me should be banned, which was banned by the Communist Party. Uh many other things which I could not understand of course at that time. I understand it now. And uh so I joined that group till I find out that they were...this was just a uh arm of the Communist Youth movement so I left them but I had some idea about the Communist uh Marxism, Communism, Leninism, so forth, the way it was then...you know, it changed. Especially lately. When I came home and in 1939 when the Soviet Union occupied this part of Poland...the Germans occupied the other part of Poland...I uh became active in the local the uh well cultural Communist uh leadership of the town. I got ...as a as a result of this I got the job as the manager of the village store and it lasted till 1941 when the Germans attacked the Soviet Union. Q: A: The Soviet occupation was difficult. We didn't feel it so much in our town because there were no no bourgeois, no no people that were sent away but there were Poles that lived around, settlers. They were not native to this part of the country, but Poland settled them there after 1918, 1920. These were participants in the Polish war for independence, in the 1st World War, and they awarded...they gave them parcels of land to to work and there were they were called colonies. They were not called villages. They were called Polish colonies and one night they called me and ______, cold...it was a very cold winter in 1939-40. They called us to the village uh _____, well the the uh the local the local the 5 local authorities and uh I saw a lot of wagons there. There was not even a ______ yet. This was still still uh privately owned. They called them all _____. They were sitting there was a some people from the NKBD in charge of this and they told us...uh first of all they screened everyone of us and said can you, can you spend the night, can you spend the morning and so forth, and when they came to me I told them I can't...I have to be in the morning in the store because I have to distribute bread and there was...aga...again a military garrison there which we supplied with bread, their families would buy bread, and I had to be there in the morning. I I smelled there was something wrong there. I didn't know what. In the morning when I woke up I saw hundreds of wagons taking away these Polish families from all around, from the whole region, uh loading them into into uh freight cars. Uh they had, these freight cars had little stoves to heat...not like the German. By by the way, I think that Hitler learned from Stalin how to how to do these things. Of course he improved on it using German technology and German, you know, ___ but originally it was tough. And in one night they re-settled hundreds of families in our region, Poles, and sent them to Siberia. Also some of the former Communist leaders were arrested and you know, it was kind of uh the same thing I think that is going on _____ Israel. They they...(___________) I know, but but there is there is a common thread there. Uh whoever had some grudge against somebody else, they denounced them and they were taken away. I know a very good friend of mine was...a Ukrainian, not a Jew, Ukrainian...leader of the _____, spent probably about four or five years in Polish jails for being a Communist. The Communist Party was illegal in Poland, and he was sent away to Siberia, together with these Poles, the same night. But we didn't have...there weren't very many rich Jews in town. _________ sent away, most of...in the big cities they sent away all these rich Jews...(laughter) you know, a small manufacturers, small store owners, they sent him away, doing him a favor by the way because most of them survived. Most of them survived. Some died from hunger, starvation but some survived, so it was not as...I had it very well, you know, I I had a good job. I had no problems, you know. Whatever came in I could have...the the...there wasn't much available but there was bread, you see, and there was sugar. Sugar was a luxury item, but the little I got, you know, first of all I ______ my family. My father worked as the uh accountant at the regional uh group in the same organization...the uh cooperatives, village cooperatives, and my brother came from Warsaw. My brother was in Warsaw. When I when I left, he came to Warsaw and he somehow got established with my uncle. He managed his business. This uncle of mine in Warsaw didn't speak Polish. He was born in Poland. You know, for for hundreds of years....he lived in Poland but he did not speak Polish. He spoke Yiddish. And my brother managed his business. He was manufacturing uh locks for women's pocketbooks, and he kept the books and delivered ___ the shop here. He employed about four or five people there, but when the war...when the Germans occupied, he left Warsaw. There were, you know, thousands and thousands who left Poland, crossed the River Bork (ph), and came _____ the German or Soviet authorities. So uh it was difficult but it was bearable to live. To us it was...I even believed some of their slogans, see, about uh rights of minorities, because the left persecuted the Jews, Jews couldn't a job. In Poland it was impossible. And the Polish uh from 1920 till 1939 uh there wasn't a single Jewish policeman, not a single Jewish railroad man, not a single Jewish uh letter carrier or street sweeper. All 6 government jobs were closed to Jews. And here the Soviet Union came in and _______ to calling somebody a dirty, you know, Jew or kike (ph)...it was fifteen years in Siberia. This was Stalinism, and so _____ so uh it was kind of...we didn't realize then what was going on in the Soviet Union. Of course there were millions already sent away. Millions dying. There was there was cannibalism. But we didn't know that... to us this was ideal. It took us some time. In 1941, when the war started between...the the Germans...the the...Hitler's forces attacked the Soviet Union. We were about uh forty kilometers from the border. I was mobilized into the Soviet army. I was too old already to go in the regular army...I was called to reserve training, for about four or six weeks ________ . I was already at that time twenty-six. They took me for a few weeks into a unit which watched enemy war...uh enemy aircraft, in training, of course, because nobody expected a war. This was about the middle of June, June 10th or 12th, somewhere along there ________. I was stationed at the same in town. These people would go home for meals and uh one day, on June 22nd, I happened to be on watch in a tall tower. I was standing there with binoculars watching for enemy craft, and sure enough I saw enemy craft...I saw the German Mescherschmidts (ph). They were flying on their way back from Kiev. They had already bombed Kiev, the last city in the Ukraine, and on the way back they dropped a few bombs in our...at the railroad sta tion, not aiming at anything, just to create a little bit of panic. And when I called the center to tell them ...it was an old fashioned field telephone...you crank it...and I called that this wasn't the uh ______ headquarters. It was ____ here, and I called them and told them that I think I saw (laughter) I saw enemy craft and that they bombed our railroad station. (Laughter) He says is that so. ____________. They knew already ______, and so he asked me what kind of _____ it was and I told him. He said well, we were attacked by the Fascists and this is war. We saw a few more...within the next few days we saw a few more uh German aircraft flying over our town. They didn't do any damage ______ bombs, but within a week or so we could hear artillery...uh noise of artillery shells, in the distance of about twenty or thirty kilometers, and that meant that was retreat. So with my unit...uh I went home to say goodbye. We didn't know how long it will last, _______ heroic Red army will not let uh the ______ occupy. It just, you know, happened in the beginning they didn't expect it was, you know, we'll get it back. No question about it. We will be in Berlin probably within...the same the same thought was in '39. I I...a funny thing...in the Polish...I was also mobilized in the Polish Army doing the same thing. It was not the army, but it was like a national guard...uh we watched for for German planes and _________. They never occupied until then. So we retreated, and we kept retreating and the further east we went, the further east the Germans were. They they put...they dropped parachute drops ahead of us. Great panic. Small groups. Uh the Russians were not prepared war. They told, you know, they they killed the great generals _______ and others ______ killed _____, so they were without a uh higher uh staff of skilled officers. They had to train new ones. They were unprepared and we thought that this was an army that cannot be defeated but they didn't have to fight uh Poland. Poland was of course done in seventeen days. And we saw these big tanks, the the all the equipment they had, which we did not see in the Polish army. Of course we didn't realize what the German army had, so the further we went the further they advanced, till finally we came to a town where we we couldn't go any 7 further, but somehow we got out and we came to Kiev (ph), and in Kiev they assigned me and a few others to to another unit. It was a uh machine gun unit in in bunkers. The...about twenty, thirty kilometers from Kiev.

The Soviet Union has every every every establishment uh the commercial or military uh etiquette, used to have a war paper, paper that was, you know, the praise those who did good work and criticize those who did bad work, and so on and so on.

The irony of the thing was was that the native Ukrainian soldiers that lived around the Ukraine, they deserted by the thousands. We did not, especially Jews, because we knew where we going to desert. You know, if we fall into German hands we'll be dead, so we stayed to the last man, and we came uh...they took us on the front and again we were in Kiev and within two days that territory was occupied by the Germans.

Then we saw a group of uh Soviet sailors...not the sea sailors...they had a group...they had a unit of uh river sailors, marching in formation, trying to get out of town.

You're lucky if it doesn't leak and you wash yourself and you can shave...there there's a barber that shaves you, and uh you know, from the whole week coal dust your face was black and when they shaved you and all of a sudden (laughter) white here and black all around. You couldn't wash it (laughter) that much in one..... you got rid rid of it, and uh we stayed there for about a year and a half. Uh the worst thing was in the...if you worked in the winter...we came there in the winter. The first winter was something horrible. Uh this is near Mos... this is near Moscow but a hundred kilometers from Moscow. It was called the sub-Mos...Moscow uh uh coal fields. They dig uh the soft coal, not the good uh quality coal.

We had the long uh troughs, uh sinks-like with with cold water, no warm water. I somehow tried to use my fingers as a toothbrush and brush my teeth and wash my face. (Laughter) That didn't help much.

And you come out and you have to go one by one across the...they they the guard sitting in a little enclosure and they called your last name and you have to answer with your first name and your father's name. And if they found that somebody stole something from the camp...what to steal I don't know...uh, you know, they keep somebody so you stand and wait. They just take about an hour before the whole shift would be called. There was ten, ten uh brigades or so, and we used to stand and wait from the first one. It was horribly cold...forty below zero, and across the street there was a large, a large uh baking factory, a bakery, which was hugh and the smell of the fresh bread...it could drive you nuts. It was the worst thing...and the guards 13 used to stand around you in sheep...sheepskin uh coats with the kelp (ph) boots and dogs...____.

I don't remember if it was a sleigh or or or a wagon, but it was like a box, you know, for delivery. It turned over...a few hundred loaves of bread and it disappeared in two minutes. (Laughter) I I couldn't get any but a friend of mine...if you lived there, very, you know, very close to each other, regardless. I was the only Jew. Later on I saw another Jew, and there were three...then I found out there were three more Jews toward another part...but that bread disappeared. He gave me a piece of that bread and ____ and we stood at the mine and worked and the norm was twelve uh tons in eight hours. Uh I was...I used to dig the coal. Later on we we got uh some explosives to explode it before we dig it, and I had girls load it on the conveyer belt, metal conveyor belt. That was it. So we stayed there for about a year and a half. Then again, after Stalingrad they started taking uh German prisoners. They needed the place for them. They let us free. But not to move. You had to stay and work in the mine as a free coal miner. By the way, the coal miners are the elite of Soviet workers, you know. They get the highest uh pay...at that time we didn't...the highest pay. They have access to cars now and at that time it was...we had access to a higher ration of bread. Then they transferred us to another mine, a few kilometers away, and there we were free already. Again, we we lived in barracks but I mean no no guards. It was like uh workers' quarters. And there it was a little easier. You know, a lot of girls and young men...you know, it was...uh I have some good memories of that time, even though ___ we always hungry a little bit, a little bit...not too bad and we used to get...if you made the norm used to get a hundred grams of vodka or a hundred grams of uh uh pork, and I used to...(laughter)...suck ____ with the skin on it.

We had two meals a day, the bread...and and I never had, I have...a lot to eat and I never could save up my bread for an extra meal. I had to finish it from the beginning to the end, but we ate in a in a cafeteria. They served us meals there. Uh this lasted till '45. The war ended and we celebrated. We got beer. We had...there was another camp near us, next to ours, which was the same as we had before. Guarded, but they...up to...they had to be there to sleep in the camp, but I mean they had freedom to move around uh after work, and to work they went by themselves, without guards, you know. This was this was Soviet Germans, not German prisoners of war. They were Soviet Germans. Some of them didn't even know German. They came from they, a lot of them from the Vulga (ph), near the Vulga. There was a German uh autonomic region which had...I I happened to walk by by the way through my wanderings I happened to go by there when they were resettled, in 1941, when the war started. The ______. There were about a million and a half of them. They were resettled. Never came back. And I saw the difference between their villages and the the Russian villages.

They had autonomy. They had schools taught in German. I met these people in in in the coal mine, in the next coal mine, so they...and and and we celebrated the end of the war. It was May 5th I think it ended, ___ Russian ____ date _______. And we picked a fight with these Germans and I got a black eye. I got drunk, got beer. Didn't see beer, you know, for ages. (Laughter) But we we got drunk. Some of them were our very good friends. There wasn't only the Germans but there were others who they didn't know...there was a fellow there who was of Finnish extraction, a a Moscovite (ph). Very nice fellow. He was an engineer I think. He was...he used to fix the conveyor belts in the mine. ______. Eric was his first name. I met his mother while I was in Moscow later on _____ and we were very very good friends. Then one day I was sitting in the mine. Uh we used to be...we used to welcome if the conveyor belt would break, you see. Then you couldn't work. You had to sit down. It was the (laughter) it was in the fall, and I was sitting there on a pile of coal uh waiting till they fix it, and all of a sudden I heard something ______. (Laughter) It was...(pause)...I get even emotional now about it. He was uh...I walked over to the corner, the next corridor and there's a fellow sitting on the uh...we used to call them coates (ph)...it was a the little wagon on the rails, you know...it was a narrow gauge rail and they delivered the uh lumber to keep these you know...you use lumber in mines for holding up the the roof. Usually it is dry pine but during the war anything will do, so we had very heavy...and they used to deliver it with that wagon and it was not closed but it has four posts, four posts loaded to bring it. We used to laugh at them because this was the easy work, see. We were in the mine and they delivered and go back. And uh we are sitting down resting...I knew him, I saw him with the Germans from the German camp. _____ says who are you? Are you Jewish? I said of course. So they they they didn't know what to do with him. They...it's a Romanian Jew. A Romanian Jew. And they didn't know what to do with him and they put him in the in the uh camp with the Germans, so he had it both ways. The Germans used to call him dirty Jew, and to the Russians, to the Russians he was a dirty German. (Laughter) So he was in the middle. So we had a talk and wished him a happy New Year. We didn't know it. We didn't know then when any holiday is. But this, even now I talk about this. You'll forgive me. (Pause) Good old days. So anyway, we worked there till '45 and the Poles and the Soviets agreed to let all those Jews and Poles who were, lived in Poland in 1939 to leave the Soviet Union. I applied and it took me a whole year before they gave me permission to leave. Wherever there were uh great concentrations of Jews there was no problem. They put them in trains, you know, and sent them to Poland. But wherever there was one or two, you had to go to the NKBD and they tried to dissuade you. What you going to do? What you going to Poland? You are a Jew. They hate Jews. Say well now there are People's Republic of Poland...they are like communists. They said they'll never be good communists. (Laughter) Sure enough, sure enough. So...but in '46...I forgot there was another Jew. The director, the director of the mine was a Jew. The Russians (laughter) couldn't understand how come you are working in the mine. Why don't you....so but we didn't have much in common because we didn't have any social ____. One day I came in and he was taking a haircut and I was waiting for a haircut. And he wrote down...in Russian everything you have to write down a statement, you know, whatever you want, so one day I wrote down I wanted to go to the army. But the war was not finished yet. 15 And I wrote that I already found out that my family perished. I got a letter when I was in the first mine. I...when the front approached my town, uh they were probably fifty to a hundred miles uh kilometers away...I wrote a letter to my home town, to whoever may...whoever, you know, uh got it and the and the local Soviet there, they'll know who I am. They'll know the family, because it was a small town. I figured whoever will get it, I will find out something. So I wrote and the town was not yet liberated, but the next town east was liberated, and a friend of mine worked in the post office. There were already established post offices and he worked in the post office and he intercepted that letter. And he wrote to my brother who was already, who was in the partisans and he told me about ____.

Now the Jews had the opportunity to steal some of it and trade it with the peasants for food, so for a year they lived not bad. Although here and there they would kill a Jew or beat up...my brother was beaten up, my father was beaten up, but it was not so bad. They didn't know what's going on in the whole world, or the next town even, but there was no ghetto. They could move ___ and they lived not bad with this, you know, relatively not bad.

My brother...my brother was...a friend of mine went into ___ that came and and I got him settled in my town and he then couldn't escape. So they organized a group to go to the forest, uh get some arms so they can go to the peasants and terrorize them into giving them some food, _________, get some food and about...over twenty left. Half of them survived. Among them were my two brothers. They left the night before the ghetto was destroyed. They...there was no ghetto till that day. It was a week before Rosh Hashannah, in 1942, when they decided to kill the Jewish population in this the Ukraine, so they surrounded the town with Ukrainian police. Nobody out, nobody in. They brought in all the gypsies they could find into this ghetto. Uh they brought in all the Jews that lived in little villages, one family, two families they brought. Some they killed right there, but the majority they brought and put into this town and they knew already that something is happening, so the night before before it happened...it was on a Friday, twenty-three days _____ a week before Rosh Hasshannan. Uh my friend...friend of mine who lives in Israel told me this story...came to urge my brothers to join them. They planned it before, but they couldn't leave the family and they felt you know they are abandoning the...my two sisters.

Uh my brothers left and went to the forest and went to terrorize some peasants, got some food and organized a partisan group to fight the Germans, with what, how I don't know.

And some of them uh craftsmen, you know, uh blacksmiths, uh uh they built, built stoves and uh stone masons, uh tailors...because there were a lot of Jews in the little towns did these things, you know, most of them.
