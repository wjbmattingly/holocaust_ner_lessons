Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 3swimming lessons. We were three Jewish boys in a class, we were completely ignorant. So that was ™33, and the ne xt step was my father™s business. Q: Let -- let me stop you for a just a sec ond, you™re running a little bit ahead of me. I need you to tell me your father™s name and what he did for a living. A: My father na -- father™s name was Joseph Katzenstein and my mother™s name was Irma. He eventually built up a very good sized business that he had first a man with horse and wagon making deliveries. Much later on he bought a truck and the same man become a truck driv er. My mother was in the office, she had the office, and they sold feed -- seeds, to the farmers, and also bought grain and so on from the farmers that my father sold to the mills. This was -- this is now the early 30™s. In 1935, the German government -- Q: I -- I wanted to ask you one more question about your father before you went ahead. Was your father ever in the military? A: Yes, my father was in World War I. He was in Poland and he was in a prisoner of war camp and he was a [indecipherable]. He said anti-Semitism was there already then. He remembers a bullet of one his own comrades going past his head. He, in 1919, when Germany ga-gave up, they just got on a train and went home. So that was 1919 and I™ll go ba ck now to the -- ™35. Q: One more question, did you ha ve any brothers or sisters? Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 4A: I had one brother who surv ived, and he lives in the Detroit area. My father™s -- the German government prohibited my father to buy grain from the farmer, and that stopped the business because the farmer could not buy from him any more. So he made a decision that he wanted to leave. I have something else to [indecipherable], which I forgot. In 1933, when Hitler came to power, in our county, every Jewish man was put in the county prison. My father was in there for about eight, 10 days. They were mistreated, but he didn™t tel -- talk too much ab out it. He wanted to leave Germany right then and there, in 1933, and my mother said here -- I was born here, she said, I™m supposed to leave? My grandparents said, oh he was voted in, he™ll be voted out again. Th-Then, as I said, in ™35, he -- we had -- the business wa-was gone and we had to leave. He decided where -- anywhere, but bor -- boundaries weren™t open. He had an uncle which lived near Holland and he was able to buy two properties in Holland belonging to people in Germany. You were only allowed to take 10 marks out of Germany , but he bought two properties in Holland, and then we were allowed to move to Holland . This was 1937. And we had a boarding house, we had cows. I star ted farming with a bi g Belgian horse and what else could we do? Q: So -- be -- I want to stay with -- with Germany for just a few more moments -- A: Sure. Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 5Q: -- ask a few more questions. When you were a young child in school, what did you want to be wh en you grew up? A: I always wanted to be an architect, there was no doubt about that. I had planned that well in advance. But I went -- the high school that I went to was a realschule . We didn™t have Latin, so you couldn™t become a doctor, but it cou -- you could go on t -- to any other education. But then in 1935, when we decided that we had to leave Germany, I quit school, I was fo -- when I was -- no six -- ™36. I wa -- 14, you were no longer -- had ne -- compulsory to go to school, you could go out on your own. And since we were going into fa rming, I went to work for a gardener and learned a little bit there. My father knew farming quite well because he advised farmers what to do. So when we came to Holland, again, we went into farming. Q: Still on Germany. A: Yeah. Q: Can you walk me through some of the changes that the Jewish community experienced after Hitler came to power? I -- now -- you -- you were -- you can talk about the -- A: Well, I know this -- Q: -- years from ™33 to ™37. Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 6A: I know this, they had Winterhilfe, which was they collected money to help the poor people, the Jewish cu -- community ha d to do that too. My grandfather, as the president of the congregation was in charge of that, and I was sent out to collect for Winterhilfe [indecipherable]. We were four or five Jewish children in town and at Hebrew school we had a teacher. In t hose days that one man was a teacher, a Chazzan, a Shochet, he did everything. And I remember synagogue very well. At 1928 it was completely remo-modeled because it was very old, and I -- I remember the services and all those things as a child. Be -- it was part of me. Q: Do you remember reading any of the newspapers in Germany while you were still living there? Do you remember any anti-Semitic literature? A: I -- I™m sure we read a daily paper, but I-I was too young to really understand or to read it, I -- as I said, I was 12 -- ™35, I was -- I was Bar Mitzvah in ™35, and I mean, I-I -- I don™t think I read the paper much. Q: What were you allowed to take with you when you left Germany? A: [indecipherable] Q: What were you -- what coul d you take with you? You personally, when you left. A: We were allowed to take almost anythi ng, and we packed with the supervision of the Gestapo. We actually took two railroad cars full of farm equipment and things we needed in the house. I had a stamp collection and they looked it over, obvious it Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 7wasn™t tremendous. And we got almost ready to take everything we wanted except they wouldn™t permit my father to take a new car. He wanted to take a new car and they said no way. A -- a little sidelight. My father was suing the German government then, for a tax matter. And they told him, if you sue the German government, we won™t let you go. So, of c ourse he had to drop that. And then we went to Holland in ™37. Q: Was Holland the place that you thought you would stay, or was it a stopping point along a -- a larger path? A: We lived right along the German border, and my father™s aim was to can you go -- continue leaving. I mean, he didn't want to stay there. He wanted to leave in ™33, he certainly wanted to go on. And of course, he wanted to take as many [indecipherable] from Germany with him. He tried South America , you name it, anything. We weren™t registered anywhere . And he once had permission to go to England to take -- start a training farm for the [indecipherable]. And while he was in Amsterdam to get his visa, or permit, whatev er, he ran into a German Jewish attorney who knew the immigration laws. And he said , you™re a farmer? You don™t go to England , you go to United States. My father said, how can I go to United States, I™m not even registered in the quota. A skilled farmer will be automatically inserted in the quota. So we had to present to the American consulate in Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 8Rotterdam, my father™s background and we got permission to come to United States. A little sidelight here. My mother™s father, my grandfather had come to us, to live with us in Holland after we had applied to come to the United States, and of course we wanted to take him with us. A nd sad to say that the American consul in Rotterdam was anti-Semitic. He told my father, if he asks me once more, I won™t get you go. So my gr andfather stayed in Amsterdam with a cousin of my father™s, and he died a natural death in 1941. But the cousin, husband, they got killed. We left June 9th, 1939 [indecipherable] Amsterdam to come to the United States . Q: Tell me about the time that you stayed in Holland. How -- how much were you aware of what was going on in Germany? A: Very much so. As I said, we lived along the border, and people came to us illegally and we had a sort of an underground railroad, where we would help the people that came in, got a taxi for him in the town of Arcen, where we lived. And he would take them to the nearest Jewish community in Fendler. And they would then help these people to get further into Holland for -- then they were allowed to stay. I mean, we had cases where people went right back. One of the Dutch border policemen ha -- was forced to put some people back into Germany, and he told me, I won™t do that again. And you know, thin g -- when they were caught they were done for. This was right after Kristallnacht, yeah. Yeah, tha -- there wasn™t much Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 9after that. I mean, we got our permission to go, we sold our property and -- until everything was ordered, til we have our tickets. Q: How do people know how to find you on this unde rground railroad? A: Believe it or not, the German border polic e helped. They said, over there is a -- another Jew. He will help you. There were some German border police that did that. Some came over blind and somehow wound up with us. Since we had a boarding house in addition to being farmers -- also the Dutch border police would bring them to us while they would try to get permission to stay. One or two did, but most of them didn™t. I mean, they put them across the border they could turn around, come right back. But what really happened to most of them, we don™t know. I know one man, he went back up in Vienna. And we even moved from our farm after we sold, to another town near Fendler called Blerick, and he wrote to Mr. Katzenstein, near Fendler , and the letter got to us. I don™t kn ow whether he survived or not. Q: Can you tell me what you heard about Kristallnacht from where you were? A: I was in Holland, I wasn™t in Germany , and I know the -- from the Jewish point of view, we were permish -- we had permission to do anything. We were -- don™t -- didn™t have to observe the Jewish laws about Shabbat. We just helped the people that came. That™s -- I mean, I -- I -- as we heard -- of course we heard the news and so on, what happened in Germany. That year, ™38, my grandmother died on the last Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 10day of Hanukah . And of course my father didn™t go back to Germany. I went back -- I was a 16 year old and I went back to the funeral. I™m here. I was -- I came back again. Q: What was your -- what was your legal status as you were going back and forth from Holland to Germany for this fu -- A: We were Germans. We were Germans. We were German citizens. In fact, we had to go to the German consulate in Mastreif then had the J, Jude , put into our passports. We had G-German passpor ts. Look, our legal status in Holland was that. When I came to United States we were enemy aliens. I went into the army as an enemy alien. Q: When you left Germany, were you able to say goodbye to family and friends? A: Not really. There was one German farmer who wanted to say goodbye to us, but he couldn™t do it openly. And he got on th e train with us to say goodbye and went with us a couple of stations and then he went back. So -- but otherwise, there was no saying goodbye. The relative -- we ha d no relatives in to wn, maybe we said goodbye to the Jewish families that were there. By the way, I -- the record at the Holocaust Mu-Museum, I know that all the people that didn™t get out shortly after we got out, they all got killed. Q: Did you have any regrets at all about leaving Germany? Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 11A: Not at all, I™ll give you a -- a [indecipherable] question. You know, I mentioned I was in the American army. And we have a reunion -- ma -- the company, not the division, I was in hundred infantry division. And we had a reunion and one -- the wife of one of my comrades asked me how -- how -- what did you -- how did you feel like fighting the Germans? I said, very gladly. They would have killed me if I wouldn't have go-gotten out. No, there was no regret about leaving Germany for a second. Q: Is there anything about your time in Germany or in Holland that we haven™t discussed that you™d like to mention be fore we move into the next stage. A: Probably after you leave I™ll remember, which is normal. I mentioned my father™s experience, I mentioned our experience in Holland. Nothing outstanding. We had -- we had the boardin g house and people coming across the border. Ha -- ha -- I remember I had to sleep in the haystack a couple of nights once because we had so many people. But nothing outstanding. Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism in Holland? A: No. Not at all. At least we didn™t. My wife told you the experience of her father, but we have personally -- that personal co ntact we had was absolutely good. I -- I don™t -- I could mention something, but it™s not off the record. You want to stop for a second? Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 12Q: No, we-we™ll continue. A: Okay. I-I met somebody recently, here, whose mother came from the same town where I lived in Holland. And it™s a small world, but th -- I didn't know her. I knew her family and we -- there are many people that we both knew. So, she lives right here. I haven™t met her yet, we just talked on the phone. Q: When you left Holland , did -- did you have any expectations about what your new home, where you™re going to be arriving soon, was like? A: No, our aim was to become farmers. Whe -- when and where, we had no idea. My f -- they were German Jewish real estate agents who took you under their wing and tried to sell you a farm. We were [indecipherable] into New York and my father entered a federal land pact in, I think it was Somerville, New Jersey, and he bought a farm from a piece of paper. We had -- had three houses. Had over 120 acres, 150 acres, and he bought that on a piece of paper. This Jewish Agricultural Society, we had some money fro -- obvi ously from selling our property, and the Jewish Agricultural Society gave us a s econd mortgage to build a chicken coop. There were Jewish people in the area who were very helpful and I know there was one family, they picked up my mother every week to go to Camden to the shircha to go to the butcher store and so on. I mean they were very helpful. Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 13Q: Were you helped by any Jewish agenci es or were they just individuals who helped you? A: No, we ha -- no -- the Jewish Agricultural Society, but o-otherwise, these real estate people were private salesmen and they -- they didn't help you. Q: Nobody like HIAS or anybody else? A: No, no, we were not involved with that. Q: Okay. Before we get too much into your life in the United States , how did you come to the United States , how did you travel here? A: In the [indecipherable] . Was a new boat. We went third class, we couldn™t afford anything better, and was the time of the World™s Fair and the people were coming from all over the world. EEventually, after we were in New York we rented a room with somebody in Washington Heights, and two of my uncles were wor -- had jobs at the World™s Fair and ev entually we wound up -- I said, everybody is coming, why don™t we go? In those days the subway was a nickel. And we went out there to look and the thing that impressed me most was the ice water dispenser at the General Elec -- General Motors exhibit. That impressed me most. My mother was very disappointed. There was a place that sold root beer and it didn™t taste at all like the beer she expected. We looked for farms and as I said, we bought a place with three houses. The first we moved into one house, good one -- two story, and Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 14then we sold the two newer houses to je -- also German Jewish families that had come. One family came from Berlin, one family came from Frankfurt , and we moved in the old house, which had nothi ng. The -- the hot water was made on the stove in the kitchen. No heating system. Water, we had a well, and we had a -- we had a pump in there, and we couldn™t afford a deep well pump, so a plumber came and he built a platform in the well from which a regular pump could supply us with water. There was a Jewish plumber in Camden who would underwrite a loan so we could build a heating system, which of course he built. So we got a heating system, we got hot water and we started farming. At first I worked with a team of horses. Took a few years til we could afford a tract or, but again, we raised chicken feed. We grew corn, we grew wheat, and that we used for a chicken feed. The salesman for the feed dealer sold us our first car. This was 1939 - ™40 - ™41 -- ™40. And he -- was oh, I think a ™26 - ™28 Chevy or Ford, whatever. But now we had a car. My father had to get a driver™s license, but that was no problem. And -- Q: Tell me how you found out that war had broken out in Europe. How did you learn about it? A: Oh, we had a radio, we listened to the news, we got a daily paper. So we knew one what -- knew what was going on in the world. And of course , Hitler came into Holland, what was it, we left June ninth, he went into Holland May first. So we Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 15knew that we got out by the skin of our teeth, and we could breathe a little heavier, although we were worried about the [indecipherable] that were left behind. I had, in the meantime, ™39 - ™40, most of the relatives that were in -- were left in Germany had gotten out. There was one uncle who was interned in England in the Kitchener camp, but he got permission to come he re and he came too. Came to us first, working on the farm. Q: When you came to this country, did an ybody ask you about your experiences in Europe ? A: Not that I remember. I -- I didn™t go to school, I was 17, I was old enough to stay out, and maybe I™m regretting it or not, bu t my brother went to high school, and literally I went with him. I had all the books. I learned lot of history, I learned a lot of things by just reading. I™m still a -- learning. Q: Were you able to keep in touch with people that you had left behind in Germany when you came to the United States? A: In the beginning yes, but then when in ™41 the U.S. entered the war, even postal communication was difficult. Eventually the ones that were left behind got killed. Q: But in the correspondence that you were able to get, what kinds of things did they write about? Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 16A: Literally nothing. The -- look, the mail was censored, they knew that. And they just that we do fine -- look, I -- we are now translating correspondence like that, we™re -- a-at the museum, and it™s all -- the letters are repetitive. That™s all the s -- because that™s all they could tell. Q: So you were in your late teens and working? Was that something that you wanted to continue to do i ndefinitely, is -- to do the -- A: [indecipherable] Q: Is that what you wanted to do? A: Well, fr -- I -- I loved farming, and some people can™t understand that, but I did. I raised chickens, we grew corn, I worked with a tractor and my father built up a retail route in Camden . And the nearest congregation was in Haddonfield, New Jersey, or Haddon Heights, New Jersey. And since we were fairly observant, we didn't go to synagogue except at the hi gh holidays, where we usually went to New York where a -- my uncles lived. So we went there. We had some -- some family in Philadelphia found us, distant relatives and we went there occasionally. Like when my brother became Bar Mitzvah on the farm, some -- he went to Philadelphia to get his Bar Mitzvah lessons, and then from Philadelphia they [indecipherable] for his Bar Mitzvah . Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 17Q: What stands out in your mind about th e time from ™39 when th e war broke out in Europe until Pearl Harbor? A: Well, there was really -- I mean, the war was going on. We knew that and we were very glad that we were in the United States. And I had to register for the draft [indecipherable] enemy alien. Legally, we were not alle -- allowed to leave New Jersey. We weren™t supposed to go to Philadelphia or anything, and once in awhile we asked for a travel permission, but usua lly we went when we could. And I got registered for the draft and my father tried to have me deferred because he needed me for the farm. But after many, many applications, eventually he was denied and I had to -- to register and I was drafted in March of 1944, as an enemy alien. I only became a citizen after I was in the army. Q: Tell me your reaction to Pearl Harbor. When you heard about it, what -- what did you think? A: Oh, I was shocked, of course, absolu -- heard it on the radio, and in a way a -- this happened, so we™re in -- totally involved now. I mean a -- in a w-way I knew that I ha-had to go in and a -- a -- it wa s a hundred percent American, even though I wasn™t a citizen yet. And I felt very glad that things had come to that point. Q: Tell me about your military service. When exactly did you start and -- and what training did you receive? Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 18A: Well, I was drafted March 27th, 1944, which later on turned out to be my wife™s birthday. And I was sent for basic training to Camp Blanding in Florida , infantry basic. I was classified not for i -- outright infantry, but infantry in -- I and R, Intelligence and Reconnaissance. Not that it helped any. Was still infantry basic. And when that was finished I had to report to Fort Mead, Maryland , and supposedly to go to the Pacific. But then a rule came out, anybody over 23 goes to Europe and since I was over 23, I a -- I mean a -- over -- I-I was reclassified to go to Europe . I was then sent to the hundred -- to join the hundred infantry division in Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Company -- Q: Let me pause because I™m afraid I™m going to run out of tape. Just one minute. End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Werner Katzenstein. This is tape number one, side B. And you were telling me about your military service, the very beginning of it -- A: Military service. Q: -- yes. Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 19A: I joined the hundred infantry division at Fort Bragg and we prepared to go overseas. We had some more training, obstacle course and so -- and so on, under fire. And then, eventually, we got ready to go. I think, yeah, it was Yom Kippur when we left Fort Bragg and we went on to Camp Kilmer in New Jersey . We only spent a few days there. Since I was cl ose to home I got permission to go home a couple of times. But then when we boarded th e transport and we ar -- and we™re in a convoy of the hundred infantry division. We left about that time, we arrived [indecipherable] Gibraltar in the Marseilles area around November first. And then we went up through the mountains t -- into the Vosges mountain range. We actually went on the line around septem -- November first and -- where we relieved the 45th infantry division. We went out on a pa trol and I think the patrol of my first platoon was the first combat action of the division. And we went back and then we got into combat from -- attacked a few town s, took a few towns. And on the sixth or seventh November in the town of [indecipherable], I got wounded. You know, the saying is you take the town and the hi gh ground beyond it. Th e Germans were on the high ground. We were in the town. And I was lucky I got not -- I got wounded and came out to a field hospital -- or a fiel d hospital to a -- in a battalion he -- first aid station, then to a field hospital wh ere they operated on me to remove the shrapnel from the wound. It was in my buttock. And I remember clearly s -- Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 20everyone saying, who do we have here? Katzenstein, pronounced in perfect German. And I was hoping this wasn™t a German doctor. Anyhow, I woke up the next day in a field hospital, believe it or not, a German, wounded German prisoner of war was lying next to me. Curiosity, I started talking to him. All I have to give you is my name and number. He wouldn™t talk to me. Maybe he thought we were pulling a trick, but I was there and then I was -- I don™t know, four or five, six days. Then we were put on a train to get to the nearest hospital, I think at Besançon . And on that train there were only sitting and walking patients. I couldn™t sit. They had to put up a stretcher for me in the supply car. And I was there a few days. There was some movie actress with us, I don™t remember who it was. And as I said in the beginning I was classified lightly wounde d. They took me now off on a stretcher and I stayed there, I don™t know, a week or so. And there they sewed up the buttock wound. Stayed there, I don™t remember, til they thought I was well enough. And the doctor was very kind. A milit -- a medical officer is out to get you back to the front too mu -- as quick as possible. A doctor was try to keep you in the hospital as long as possible. And this one said, evacuation to the rear. Q: To what? A: To the rear. And I wound up in a ho spital which at one time had been a -- a German hospital, a army hospital in the Exon Provence. And stayed there for Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 21awhile. I remember there was a case of a German prisoner of war who had lockjaw. And somehow they found out I spoke German , so they took me and our doctor and a nurse into that room. The doctor wanted to give him massive dose of antitoxin, and I had to translate to the German medic what they were going to do. I really don™t know whether the man surv ived or not. I stayed there a little while longer and then I wound up again in the field replacement hospital, where I volunteered for KP on Christmas. I had experienced that on Jewi sh holidays I didn™t ha ve to -- to work, so I figured here let™s have somebody Chri stian have a chance to have the day off. So on Christmas I volunteered KP duty. Came back to my outfit -- what was happen -- November sixth -- around Januar y sixth or seventh, and first to the kitchen and then they brought me up front. And we were in a position right in the Maginot Line. And we were pretty scared to begin with. But a infantry platoon is 40 men when they are full strength. When I came back, my platoon was 20 men, of which I knew 10. So you can imagine what they had gone through while I was away. But from then on, through the end of fighting -- I mean, I had some more experiences, but combat was co mbat. We went through the Siegfried line, we went down towards Mannheim. One thing, once we were in Germany we didn™t dig f -- dig foxholes any more, we slept in houses. And one of the worst battle ec -- battle experience I had was the city of Heidelberg. Heidelberg was sort of on a hill at the Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 22Neckar river. And the Germans for some reason or other, put up stiff resistance, very stiff. Some companies had gotten across the Neckar river, we were still on the other side. But then we had to go across. And on broad daylight, under German fire, we crossed the river. Not everybody made it. Then we went up the hill and through the Knorr soup f-factory that was on top of the hill. And the tanks of the soup concentrate had been hit with artillery. We actually went up the hill in Knorr concentrate. And we had to take the factor y. After we took the factory, we had then take -- fought street by street to take the city of Heidelberg. I mean, the Germans were just unbelievable. Then we had finally took the garrison, which they were still holding. And after we took that , they gave up -- at the le -- what was left, they left. And that -- a day or two, I -- later I was supposed to go on furlough, and I remember they sent me ba ck to battalion headquarters, and that was the morning that President Roosevelt died. Company captain that I knew told us that Roosevelt had died. Went on furlough, first they put us into a German town, but then they decided no more resort in Germany, and we were sent on to France . Then spent there a few days, went back -- Passover they pulled us off the front line and gave a Seder in a German hotel. The hundred infantry division had a Jewish chaplain, Herbert Eskin was the name, I remember him well. And we had a Seder there. Wasn™t much of a Seder, you know, but you were away from combat for a few Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 23days, and then we went ba ck. And I don™t remember the date when we stopped fighting. When we got to the outskirts of Stuttgart, we actually went into occupation. We occupied a town here, occupi ed at town there. And that was the end of combat. The war was -- wasn™t over yet. I tried to get to military government. I mean, I figured I had enough at the end of the [inaudible]. But -- went to the nearest -- no, I wrote to military government. A friend of mine was the sec -- the company clerk. And we wrote and they sent back, sorry, it has to go through channels. So it went through channels. Company commander who during combat wouldn™t let me go, when he came back, he okayed my transfer. And then I went to military government and I wound up in a county right next to the county where my father came from. And th -- this was the northernmost county in the American zone, and that was the first county in the British zone. And there was an uncle and aunt of my father™s that had come back from Theresienstadt. And of course I went to see them. And everybody in the States sent me packages for them. And then military government was very interesting. It was the starting up of German government. First we -- they needed travel permission for anything they wwanted to go. The starting of political parties -- at first political parties were only permitted on the county level, and then, of course it spread. And -- Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 24Q: Just -- just one moment, let™s let this -- sirens pass. [tape break] Okay, we™re back, the sirens have passed. A: There isn™t much more to tell after that. Q: Let me ask a few questions. I wanted to know your beginning rank and your ending rank of your military service. Your rank. Your military rank. A: When? Q: No, what was your military rank? A: Oh, I -- I was a corporal. They promised me more if I would stay. They wanted to keep me in the worst way. When I had enough points to go home, I went home. They couldn™t keep me another day. Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism in the military? A: Not really. There may have been a few guys that were not -- had no experiences with Jews, but in combat, there was no question. Q: When you arrived in Europe for your military service, how much did you know about what was happening to the Jews? A: Well, when we went into combat, we knew -- this was ™44 -- we knew that there were concentration camps and we knew that people are -- were getting killed, but not that much in detail. Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 25Q: Did you ever read the ﬁStars and Stripesﬂ magazine while you were in service? I don™t -- A: Yes, we got that regularly. And I don™t think there was too much in there about it. I don™t remember, anyhow. Q: Where were you on V-E day? A: V-E day, I -- we were still -- I was not military government yet. We were in a town -- I think was Kinitling, whatever it was called. We were doing occupation duty. And we were getting ready to be shipped to Japan. Hundred infantry [indecipherable] we were supposed to go out by way of Marseilles. And when V-E day came we were unhappy that they changed our orders, because most people went to United States first and then go to Japan, even though we we re supposed to go to Marseilles and then go to Japan, but for us it was over. I mean, the -- we did occupation duty. Was interesting, I mean, we started schools in -- within our units and I taught chicken farming, I taught Germ an, and we had all kinds of talent. We had a guy with a Master™s degree in English, you name it. The most liked class was car repair because, you know, that was everybody™s interest. We had all kinds of interests there and that was very interes ting. I ran the day room and I was giving news broadcasts to the company from what I heard on the radio. But this was now ™45, you know, the war was over, so there wasn™t much happening any more. Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 26Q: When did you realize the full extent of the Holocaust? A: I think I™d -- I- didn™t realize it until I came out of the service, til I came back home and really learned of things that ha d happened. When I came home, th -- of course there was more information available. But during the time in the service, it was not too much. Q: Let™s pause again. [tape break] Okay, we™re back. Apparently there are a lot of sirens out there. After the war, while you were still doing occupation service, what efforts did you make personally to try and find family or friends who might have survived? A: I™ll be honest, I didn™t make too many efforts. As I said, I was in military government. I knew -- I found out who was killed and where the others were that I knew by then, and I really didn™t make too many efforts. I now feel guilty about that at times. Q: When exactly did you leave Europe? A: To come home? Oh, April 30th, I guess it was ™46. Was -- my birthday was April 29th. And my brother at that time was stationed at Fort Dix, and I of course ha -- I went to Fort Dix to get discharged and our -- my birthday present was a Broadway show at Fort Dix. Q: How had things changed in the United States when you came back? Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 27A: How what? Q: How had things changed in the U.S. when you came back? A: Well, I remember there had been gasoline rationing and I think there were still things being rationed. Things -- the econom y was trying -- now had to change from a wartime economy to a peacetime economy a nd I think one of the biggest mistakes was when people said to go back the way it was before. There was no way of going back the way it was before. That didn™t exist any more. Q: How had you change d during your time in Europe? A: Well, I sort of, I guess made a promise to myself, since I survived, that I would become more observant. And I did this gradually, I mean from -- during the war, everything was permitted, but then I did th is gradually. I -- at home, on the farm, I never did any work that wasn™t necessary , even before the war. And now there was no business on Shabbat , you know, people didn™t come in to buy eggs or things. And it got known. My parents were not quite as observant as I was, and of course I became even more observant when I got married. Q: How did you meet your wife? A: Blind date in Brooklyn . She doesn™t like it when I give the complete story, so I won™t. If you want to take it off the record, I™ll take it off the record. I can™t do that to her. Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 28Q: I don™t want to get in any trouble here . Just tell me briefly, what -- what was your wife™s background? Was she born in this country? A: She was -- when I met her she was a legal secretary in New York , and when she came to Vineland there was an attorney in the neighborhood who asked her to come in to help. She stayed there for quite a few years to help. And when I came to Vineland, I worked for my in-laws. They had -- my father-in-law and his brother had a -- a big farm at -- a chicken farm, at first. And then when the chicken business went, as they say in Yiddish, indraya , he switched to dair y farming because he, after all, that was his experience, too. We -- Q: I have to ask you to translate. I know wh at that means, but you need to translate. A: Oh, it means, in the [indecipherable] literally translate, in the [indecipherable] it™s just done for. The reason for this was that, you know, all these people that came out of the camps and had came to the United States, chicken farming was a very attractive business. You didn™t have to sp eak English with the chickens. And the only way at the end that the feed dealers could compete with each other was well, they extend more credit. And when that done, overextensi on of credit, with no help from the U.S. government, chicken business went down the drain. So my father then went to dairy farming. We converted chicken coops into cow stables and I was able to do most -- I was able to do pl umbing, you name it. You do everything Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 29yourself. We had hurricane s. Oh yeah, hurricane Hazel , and -- destroyed in our area many chicken coops. In 1955 I decided I couldn™t make a living on the farm, because my wife™s paycheck had to go to the feed dealer to pay for the feed bill. So, my father had a small route, detail route in the Haddonfield, Haddon Heights area, Cherry Hill came just in existence. So I decide d in ™55, I™m going to start knocking doors. And after a year or two I built up my own route and I built up my own business, and worked well. Q: Just for the record, what -- what™s your wife™s full name? A: Inge Eva Katzenstein . Q: Do you have children? A: Yes. We have three children. We have our oldest son, Michael lives in the Boston area, has two boys. Our second one, David lives in New Jersey. He has five children, four girls and a boy, and our daughter lives in Pittsburg and she has a daughter and a son. Q: I wanted to ask you about some of the historical events. A: [indecipherable] what? Q: Historical events since the war. How closely did you follow the Nuremberg trials? Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 30A: As close as I could here, in the news I mean. And I knew some of the people that were being tried, I am -- I knew their backgrounds, you know, from experience. Ribbentrop , Papen, I mean all -- I knew the German governments then, and I knew who did what, and we knew who was lying. And I was not asked, you know, to get involved. I mean, I know people that did, but I followed it. Look, what™s his name? Ribbentrop was the foreign minister. A cousin of my mother™s was an ob-gyn in Berlin, he delivered Ribbentrop™s son. Was in those days -- later on, Pope Pius the 12th, who was in Berlin at that time, my mother™s cousin knew him. H-He worked in a Catholic hospital. I mean, this was ™37 -- ™36 - ™37. He got out, but that had nothing to do with it. Q: Did you feel that justice was done at Nuremberg? A: Yes. They -- I think they did go -- very well that -- I don™t think they let many stay alive that should have been killed. Q: Also, in -- at around that same time period, the U.N. debated on the partition of Palestine. Was that something that was of interest to you? A: Yes, that was of interest to me, because after all, we did want a Jewish state. And at the time that seemed to be the only way possible to get it. And of course, the rest is history. What™s happening now we all know very well. Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 31Q: There are some things that happened in this country, a-after the war -- you know, in years since the war. The Korean war and the war in Vietnam . Did these have any impact on your life? A: Well, I followed them as much as I could. Whether they were justified, I don™t know. Did -- I gave them thought, wh -- ho -- whether we did too much, or not enough, I don™t know. Q: Also in this country, I wanted to ask you about the Civil Rights movement. Given your personal background, how did you feel about what was going on in this country? A: I am for the Civil Rights 100 percent. I know this, in the army basic training, one of the lieutenants I worked with was a college professor from Georgia, and I questioned him, how ca n you treat the negroes like this ? And he says, the negro has to stay in his place. I mean, of course I didn't agree with him, but who was I to argue? He was a college professor. But the Civil Rights, absolutely. Q: Did you follow the Eichmann trial in Jerusalem? A: Oh, whatever we are able to hear here, yes. Q: Did you feel that the way it was reported here in this country was -- was fair and objective? Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 32A: I -- I really don™t know. They did s -- report as much as they wanted to. Look, I know a friend of mine here started an organization to protest to the Washington™s Post anything that they repor t that™s detrimental to Israel. So I-I mean we -- the papers do one thing and not always what we like. Look, what™s happening between our government and Israel right now is ridiculous at times. Q: Is there anything else that you wanted to share about your professional career? Because I have some questions about your retirement. A: Well, I enjoyed it. You know, I built up a retail route, 1955, and knocked doors and eventually got acquainted with an awful lot of people, and I think in many cases I became a member of the family. At first we were parents talking about children. They we were talking about par -- children™s education, and eventually about children™s going out and gr-grand children. So -- this is, by the way is not just -- that I had just Jewish customers. I knocked door s to door and I sold chickens and eggs and you name it, and I enjoyed it. Q: When did you move to Washington, D.C. ? A: I guess it was -- be in to -- I think December ™98. Q: And why did you move here? A: There were several reasons. Number one, my wife™s mother had been mentally deteriorated, and we ha -- and physically also. We had her in a home in Atlantic Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 33City. And then, my sister-in-law lived here for over 20 years, and she™s said the home here in Washington is much better, so we had her transferred to the Hebrew home. And for me again, one of the persona l reasons, I tried to slowly liquidate my business. I™d gotten to a point where I was making many monthly deliveries, many deliveries twice a month, and when I decided I was going to go only monthly deliveries, then we decided to come here . Also religious reason. The synagogue in Vineland where I went to on Shabbas closed down. And the oth -- there was another synagogue but on Shabbas I had to walk 40 minutes, and I was getting a little too old for that. And then here, where we moved to, I have a 10 minute walk to synagogue. We are walking distance to four different Orthodox synagogues and -- and from a kosher point of view everything is right at your fingertips. I™m enjoying it. Q: How did you get involved with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum? A: My brother-in-law , Kurt Pauly had volunteered there already for a number of years, and we decided, if we can contribute something, we can. And yes, they could use people that translated German into English. And we got and they were very happy to have us. And we™ve been doing this now for a long time. We go in at least one day a week and it™s sometimes not so nice to do what we™re doing because we Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 34can read between the lines how people are suffering, and most of the correspondence that we translate is of people that did not survive. And I™m very glad we™re going. Q: Do you speak publicly about your experiences? A: We ha -- didn™t volunteer at the museum for the speaker™s bureau, we haven™t been asked. Yeah, I think we volunteere d once, but we haven™t been asked. Our former next door neighbor is a schoolteacher here in the Montgomery County, or Howard County , I don™t know. And she arranged for us to speak to a public school, one day not long ago. And it was something we enjoyed, and the children enjoyed, and th -- there were a lot of questions. I guess they were 10 or 11 year olds, and they -- I guess that they had seen -- what is it, the David™s world, or something they had seen. Or -- Q: ﬁDaniel™s Storyﬂ? A: Yeah, or -- no, also Anne -- Anne Frank. They knew about that and they asked us many personal questions and we enjoyed it. Look, we were in Germany . The city of Cologne invited people, and we were ther e, I guess it was ™86 - ™87. And they bent over backwards to supply us with kosher food and so on. And there also we wa -- we asked to speak to schoolch ildren, school students. And we asked to Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 35higher school students. And there the questions were, of course, completely different. And the point I always made is -- how shall I say it? Q: I™ll pause. [tape break] Okay, we™re back, now that you™ve collected your thoughts. A: The point that I made was repeating something that a German mayor told me while I was in military government. And this was 1945. And he said, Mr. Katzenstein, I hope that the occupation stays here until this generation is dead. And this is what I repeated to the German high school students, because many of them told us, my mother is still a Nazi. I mean, this was now ™87. So this is what a German mayor told me, and that was sort of the point that I made. Q: I™m going to pause and change tape. End of Tape One, Side B Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 36Beginning Tape Two, Side A Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Werner Katzenstein. This is tape number two, side A. And you were telling me about your -- your visit to Germany. Was that the only time since the war that you™ve been to Germany ? A: Yes. No, no, we were recently, but that had no connection. We were back recently going to Belgium, going to Germany, and to Amsterdam. This time, my sister-in-law, we went together again, th e two couples. And our oldest son came to Cologne and to -- they went from cemetery to cemetery to look up the places where the family, my wife™s family came from. And we went to the house where my mother-in-law was born and you know, many pl aces like that. We went to the house where my wife grew up. But that was just recently. When I was back in Germany, that was the city of Cologne and they invited people that were born in the Cologne area, there were 40 people, 20 from ger -- from U.S. and 20 from Israel. That was a very interesting experience, but I don™t think it showed us much, that the Germans had changed that much. I know this, Friday night they took us to synagogue by bus and then we walked back to the hotel. And they had two men walking bus -- us, officially that we wouldn™t get lost. I think it was for security reasons. They were -- in ™87, I mean there™s -- Germany is still you don™t feel a hundred percent secure. Interview with Werner Katzenstein October 17, 2001 37Q: Is there anything that you and I have not spoken about today that you would like to add before we conclude? You had some thoughts before that you were kind of working on. A: I really can™t think of anything specific that didn™t come up -- you know, a few things did come up, but as I said before, going back to Germany was nothing joyful. Yes, when I came home somebody said, how was it going back to your home? Coming back to New Jersey, that was going back home, not when I was over there. Yeah, we came back, I went back to farming. My brother, by that time was in college and he -- he took chemical engineering. He found quickly engineering was not for him. He went -- he became a chemist and he™s doing well. Q: All right, if -- if you have nothing else t -- nothing else to add? A: Can™t think of anything at this mome nt. Probably after your gone 10 minutes. Q: Okay. I thank you very much for speaking with me today, and then this will conclude the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Werner Katzenstein. Thank you.
