3 revamps my memories. I lived most of the first -- I was born May 1, 1933. So that was four months after Hitler came to power. I lived most of my first five years in the house. >> Betsy Anthony: And you remember that time then? >> Jill Pauly: Yes. I don't remember when I was 2 or 3, but I remember getting into a confrontation with my mother because I wanted to play in the backyard. I was missing the sunshine. >> Betsy Anthony: Of course. >> Jill Pauly: And there was a hay loft. It was a walled in backyard with neighbors on the left who couldn't look in and neighbors on the right who could look in. I was 4. I wanted to play in the hay loft. She said, "N o, you can't go there." I said, " Why can't I go there?" This was 193 6, 1937. It became a big confrontation. I remember screaming. And she felt very badly, I think. She took me inside and sat me down and she explained to me why she was afraid and why she didn't want me in the backyard , back there. >> Betsy Anthony: Wo w. >> Jill Pauly: She was afraid of the teenagers next door. She wasn't sure that they were not part of the Hitler youth. And they lived such a secretive life, inward life. They didn't want anybody to know anything about what they did. You know, that's abnormal. It's totally abnormal. And children growing up in that environment start reacting. >> Betsy Anthony: So you were already feeling this at home , long before the Kristallnacht. >> Jill Pauly: Yes, yes, yes. >> Betsy Anthony: How about your fat her -- in his profession, did he feel -- >> Jill Pauly: My father got a letter. I recently got a copy. I haven't had time to search for it. It's somewhere in my papers , two pieces of paper. First letter came January 1, 1937 informing him that they could not continue in the business. They had a very, very successful business. There were four partners and my grandfather. My grandfather was retired. And they traveled a lot. They bought cattle, had it shipped to Germany. My father was a salesman. It was a very big business. And they had to stop. We lived in a Catholic community. They did have an underground of people who were anti -Nazi who tried to help. >> Betsy Anthony: Really? >> Jill Pauly: In fact, one of these people was photographed with one of my uncles by a newspaper. They were standing in the field near some cattle. They were probably talking about cows , business. And they showed him as a Jew lover in the newspaper because he was standing there with a Jewish man. It was dangerous, very dangerous for non -Jews to try to help us. This went on constantly. I never went to a park. My mother used to have -- when my sister was born, she had what's called a -- >> Betsy Anthony: A nanny. >> Jill Pauly: A nanny. But the law came out with the Nuremberg Laws, no non -Jewish young woman under the age of 45 was allowed to work for Jews. So the nannies went. I don't remember this but they tell me -- my sister told me and also an aunt that there was a 45 -year -old woman who used to come in and help. I don't remember her. She must have been very uninteresting. >> [Laughter] >> Jill Pauly: As I say, when I go back, a lot of things click, click, click, click. It's like a camera clicking. >> Betsy Anthony: I bet. >> Jill Pauly: I spoke to pe ople, Catholic people, who were children. I went back two and a half years ago, three years in October. They had invited me to come back to Lechenich and speak. >> Betsy Anthony: I'm hoping to ask you about that. >> Jill Pauly: This woman remembers. >> Betsy Anthony: Oh, wow. Great. >> Jill Pauly: Bearing witness. I didn't have a camera. I didn't have something to record her. She's five years older than I. She remembers the man that drove us away. We'll talk about that later. >> Betsy Anthony: Not great, of course. 4 >> Jill Pauly: I never would have remembered these things had I not gone back. >> Betsy Anthony: It's also interesting to hear your story as you're remembering it and not just a timeline but as you're remembering it. I wanted to touch on something you said a little bit ago. I think that your family shows, as we move on with your story, a lot of insight. A lot of people -- like your mother saying in 1929 we should listen to that guy. One example of that is you told me that your family was already trying to get out of Germany before the Kristallnacht. >> Jill Pauly: I just learned that recently. >> Betsy Anthony: Can you tell us what they were trying to do? >> Jill Pauly: It's a natural thing, normal, natural thing, when people emigrate. There are different ways of emigrating. You either come in the legal way without any pressure, you do it because you want to do it. And that's how they were thinking. I should get that out. They were not thinking that they were going to be pushed to do what they did. >> Betsy Anthony: I see. >> Jill Pauly: It sort of -- Kristallnacht -- I know my mother said my father looked around, all of 1937, where we could get in. He saw that the quota numbers for the United States, we wouldn't get ou t in time. He wanted to get out sooner. But always in his mind, knowing my late father very well, was supporting a family of seven people. Don't forget, by the 1st of January 1938, everything he owned wasn't his anymore. He got a letter that his property and whatever he had was now belonging to the state. So that was something that held him back making a living. >> Betsy Anthony: Certainly. He was looking. >> Jill Pauly: They were looking. >> Betsy Anthony: You've told me before that despite the Nuremberg Law against it your family kept kosher during this time. Can you tell us how? >> Jill Pauly: There was an awful lot of stuff that was very defiant but they also knew about Buchenwald because the camps were opened three months after I was born. But somehow psychologically that was for other people. You know? They never connected that if they got caught doing what they were doing, pssst. >> Betsy Anthony: Even then. >> Jill Pauly: Then. When the laws came out that they could not do anymore ko sher slaughtering -- one of the uncles was a butcher and did the s laughtering and sold the meat. Th ey decided they were going to continue. They did it anyway. They took the calves and the chickens to the attic in my house. They hid the special knives, which are very special. They have to be kept properly. My uncle decided to strap them on the inside of the chimney because they were raided twice. Somebody gave them away. They don't know who but somebody did. >> Betsy Anthony: Really? >> Jill Pauly: I don't think they provided other people with kosher meat. You couldn't trust your own brother. A neighbor could slip and tell someone something. So someone. But the knives weren't found. Whatever else they did, I don't know. But they did plenty. They sent the money out of the country, not legally. They hired through a connection in Holland who hired this person for them. My grandmother insisted that family money be taken out of the country the day I was born. >> Betsy Anthony: I'm wondering, is this leading to Gold schmidt? Do you want to tell us about him and how your family knew him? >> Jill Pauly: The oldest of the partners was my Uncle Joseph. He had no children. He was the wealthiest of the family. He took his wife on vacation every y ear to the mountains. I don't know which mountains. I presume the German mountains. I know it was a kosher hotel itself. It could have been Austria. Maybe Switzerland but I think it was Germany. This man was there, this is Goldschmidt , and they got t o know each other, became very friendly. And when things got really hot, Mr. Goldschmidt was willing to help. He orchestrated the smuggler getting the money out of Germany. The smuggler wasn't caught. 5 >> Betsy Anthony: Wow. >> Jill Pauly: I know they did it on the day I was born because one of my uncles was assigned to follow the smuggler and he, my uncle, was caught at the -- what do you call -- >> Betsy Anthony: The border. >> Jill Pauly: The border. They sent him back. He called and told his sister that, you know, he couldn't make it, they caught him and sent him back. She told him that I was born. So he came to Cologne to look at me. And then he continued and went over the border somewhere else. You know, the border to our family was fungibl e because they lived right on the border. My mother's family. >> Betsy Anthony: Between Germany and -- >> Jill Pauly: And Holland, yeah. Many years later I went back. I wanted to see the town of Maastricht . It was 15, 20 minutes by bicycle from where my mother lived. >> Betsy Anthony: So really close. >> Jill Pauly: Yes. So for them to be locked out of Holland was a terrible thing because they did a lot of business there. They had a lot of probably rent and land there. Some uncles lived there. >> Betsy Anthony: So it would be like Maryland and Virginia. >> Jill Pauly: Exactly. >> Betsy Anthony: It's important for Americans to have a reference sometimes. >> Jill Pauly: It was not like drive five -minute miles to get there, but my house to I th ink it's called -- Holland from where we lived, was one hour by car. >> Betsy Anthony: You were just 5 1/2 years old when this horrible night, the night called Kristallnacht happened. >> Jill Pauly: Yes. >> Betsy Anthony: You have some clear memories from that night. Would you share them? >> Jill Pauly: Yeah. For some reason that day -- early in the morning we were sitting in an upstairs room near the front door, the living room. And I think it was November. It must have been cold. My grandfather put on a little stove in the living room. So I was in there with my grandparents. There was a knock on the door at 9:00 in the morning. It was a friend, a righteous gentile. >> Betsy Anthony: You're covering your mic. There you go. >> Jill Pauly: Sor ry. >> Betsy Anthony: That's ok. >> Jill Pauly: Telling my father not to go to synagogue that day. >> Betsy Anthony: A non -Jewish friend. >> Jill Pauly: Non -Jewish friend. And my father said , ﬁW hy? ﬂ He didn't know anything. It was going on in other cities. He didn't know. It wasn't publicized. So the man said, "I don't know what's going to happen. Just listen to me and don't go." Well, that was a signal, of course. They started making phone calls. And the phone started ringing from relative s where it was happening. And also relatives where it was not happening, we should come there. It was a whole big terrible upheaval in the house, screaming. My grandmother decided we had to get out. We're leaving. And you know, when you think about th at, where do you run to? She decided we were running into the city. And I read about that in log books, that the Jews in Germany, when the pressure built in their little towns, which it did, they moved to the cities so they would be less vulnerable. People wouldn't know them is as well. Of course that didn't work but -- so that must have been the idea my grandmother got, run into Cologne and we'll separate and disperse and they won't find us. So that's what we decided to do. There was so much screaming in the house. By the time we all got in the car -- and my father called this man that he knew well who said he would take us. >> Betsy Anthony: A non -Jewish friend. >> Jill Pauly: Non -Jewish friend. Inge had gone to Cologne, my older sister. She was four years olde r. She took the train to Cologne every day to Jewish school. We couldn't go to school at the local schools because of the anti -Semitism. She came back at 9:00. And my mother saw her. And when she came 6 home -- the train went by our house and she saw her on the train. She said, " What are you doing here?" She said, " Well, I got to school and there was a fire next door. There was a lot of smoke and a lot of glass. And there was a Gestapo man in front of the door and he said , "T here will be no school today ; go home little girl.ﬂﬂ So she ran back to the train and came home. >> Betsy Anthony: So she met with it firsthand. >> Jill Pauly: She was right there. >> Betsy Anthony: Your family was now getting ready to get in the car to go. >> Jill Pauly: Not all of us. Just my sister, the grandparents. >> Betsy Anthony: Ok. >> Jill Pauly: The man who took us -- the minute we got outside the house we started to get terrorized. We were screaming like crazy. We were so terrorized. There was smoke and floating stuff. And it wasn't -- what it was, they had already set the synagogue on fire. We smelled the smoke a nd saw flames. And when children see fire, they scream. >> Betsy Anthony: Sure. >> Jill Pauly: We were terrorized. So my grand mother put us in the car with our faces down. My grandfather put his feet on my sister and she put her feet on me. >> Betsy Anthony: On the floor. >> Jill Pauly: On the floor. We couldn't get up. She figured that would quiet us down and it did. Eventually she -- she didn't want us to see out the windows. She must have recognized that there were going to be other fires. So they kept us down. And when we got near Cologne, we did see fires in the distance. I remember driving into Cologne, getting out of the car, and everything was gray. It was gray. The houses were gray. It wasn't sunny. And the flags were gorgeous, the Nazi flags. I had never seen one. >> Betsy Anthony: Wow. >> Jill Pauly: Big, red flags with long white medallion, you know, against the gray. I remembered that. I remember that. >> Betsy Anthony: Very impressive for a little girl. >> Jill Pauly: Yes. And I also liked the Nazi music. I didn't hear it very often because they made sure I didn't but I loved music. It was good marching music. >> Betsy Anthony: That it was. >> Jill Pauly: Yeah. Children don't know these. >> Betsy Anthony: Of course not. >> Jill Pauly: And I have to say, they were very good about not emphasizing the Nazi cruelty and fear more than the y had to. >> Betsy Anthony: Your parents? >> Jill Pauly: My family, yes. They were careful. I think that's why they were so -- kept me inside a lot. The less I knew, the better. >> Betsy Anthony: So then it was really shocking when you were out there and saw -- >> Jill Pauly: Oh, I had a lot to learn but I was a fast learner. >> Betsy Anthony: I guess you learn quickly in a situation like that. In Cologne, where did you go? >> Jill Pauly: We went into an apartment rented by my mother's aunts and uncles, three uncles and an aunt. They were retired in Cologne. They had to leave their town because it was really anti -Semitism. So they retired to Cologne. This was also a whole story that I never even mentioned at the museum. This uncle of my mother 's was so popular in that town that they made him -- they had these street festivals. I don't know if they're based on religious -- probably religiously based. They marched on the street, you know, a parade. And they made him the king of the parade. And he was an Orthodox Jew. Everybody knew it. It was a tiny town. When the Nazis t ook hold, this town vehemently anti -Semiti c early. So they had to leave. But they didn't go far enough. They went to Cologne. >> Betsy Anthony: I recall that you said before that once you got to Cologne and you piled into this apartment with a lot of family members, the men didn't stay there. 7 >> Jill Pauly: No. No. >> Betsy Anthony: Why is that? >> Jill Pauly: There were men there, the uncles. I have to give you th e ages. The uncles were -- uncles of my parents, so they were in their late 50s to 65, the three uncles a nd the aunt also. Somehow the older people -- this was a fallacy -- felt less threatened because they felt if they want to arrest Jewish men, they would go for the younger men first, which wasn't the case. No. That was just something they told themselves. So we get into this apartment. It turned from four people to 12 people. There were no beds for Inge and I. We managed to sleep. I don't know how. My mother's mother was really sick. She had cancer. She was bedridden. She was brought in. And I became very unhappy. I was just -- I didn't understand a lot. And they had to teach me. The pressure was on now that I had to learn this stuff about how dangerous life was. >> Betsy Anthony: Right. >> Jill Pauly: And, of course, I became unhappy. I had no children to play with. >> Betsy Anthony: In Cologne. >> Jill Pauly: In Cologne. Except there was a little girl that moved in with her mother, also under these circumstances. And that saved me because then I had a friend. For the first time I really was allowed to play outside of the family with a friend. >> Betsy Anthony: Even then this horrible violence and terrible vandalism, killings -- >> Jill Pauly: Yes. >> Betsy Anthony: Pushed your family, the final step. >> Jill Pauly: Yes. The men, uncles, all the men in my close family went into the woods. They didn't go to Cologne. They were afraid. If you remember, cut this whole thing off at 10:00 the next morning after Kristallnacht. No more stealing, no more looting, no more anything. So they didn't go home to the house ever again, any of them. >> Betsy Anthony: Oh. >> Jill Pauly: They came into Cologne. And three of them -- m y father, his brother and a cousin -- they tried to stay one or two nights. My father went to the attic in the building and took us up there to live up there. He was going to try that, like Mr. Frank. >> Betsy Anthony: To try to hide. >> Jill Pauly: To try to hide. And very luckily -- and my sister had screaming nightmares. So he really couldn't take a chance. So the next day he and his brother and a cousin got in the car and drove into Holland without papers. They were caught. They were put in prison. And the two uncles that were living in Holland saw this happening. That's a whole separate story, a difficult one. But they survived. >> Betsy Anthony: They certainly did. They organized, under very difficult circumstances, to manage to get your family out. >> Jill Pauly: Oh my goodness. >> Betsy Anthony: Several months later, I think it was May 1939, yo u and the Berg family boarded a train and then a boat and sailed for Kenya. >> Jill Pauly: Yes. The train was very dangerous. >> Betsy Anthony: Really? Why is that? >> Jill Pauly: Excessively dangerous. Because it was at the point where they were sepa rating families. That was a big joy of Nazism. My mother must have learned that being separated on the train was not unheard of so she was very frightened. She sat me down and she explained this. And I learned it. >> Betsy Anthony: Real quick. >> Ji ll Pauly: I internalized it. When I started learning that I could be separated from my mother, I grew up, lost my childhood. I was terrified. I mean, she took me to school in Cologne for a week or so and she was so terrified that she stopped taking me because she was afraid when she would pick me up that I wouldn't be there. And she got the papers during those day that we could leave so she didn't have to take me anymore. 8 We left at the end of June on the train. And her mother who was bedridden with cancer, she was assisted to the brothers, assisted living in the apartment -- m y mother said, " Mama, we're going to Africa on a ship and you're so sick and it is going to be very hot. Are you sure you want to take this trip?" And she said, " If I die on t he train tomorrow, I want to leave this place." That's why I'm here. Because had she stayed, my mother would have had to take care of her with the two of us. >> Betsy Anthony: And she made it. She made it to Africa. >> Jill Pauly: Yes. She had to be carried all the way to the train in Cologne. There was something about that. I don't know if I've ever told you. >> Betsy Anthony: You haven't told them. >> Jill Pauly: No. She couldn't walk. She was too sick. She had to be carried out of the house, into a car, into the train. The Nazis had no use for very sick people who couldn't walk. There wasn't anyone close by who could carry her. A man came who had been in Dachau for three weeks and got out. I saw for the first time wha t that meant. H e was gray. His hair was about, you know, stubbly. His cheeks -- and he was only there a month. I guess he got nothing to eat in that month. He was just so gaunt and gray. He frightened me. That's why I remember him. He got out, too, eventually. When we got on the train, my mother told me what was going to happen. We were going to be quiet. We were not going to fight at all. We could not ask to go to the bathroom. And we couldn't be hungry. Those were the rules in that category. And we were in with a sick grandmother, my mother, and two of us. And we listened. We didn't talk. We didn't move. >> Betsy Anthony: And that was because that portion of the train journey was still in Nazi Germany. >> Jill Pauly: Oh, yes. They came in to check our papers several times. That's what she was afraid of because they would say children are not properly recorded or something. Once we got to Switzerland -- it took three and a half hours. My mother smiled. And I had never seen that. I didn't think I had ever seen it otherwise why would I remember it this way. She was under so much stress in Cologne that there was nothing to smile about at any point. >> Betsy Anthony: Right. >> Jill Pauly: We got out. And each Jew that got out of Germany had to pay do uble for their tickets. And everything that we bought or packed, they allowed that. You could spend all your money, buy things and have them sent. When they got to Hamburg, half of them were stolen. The other half got to Kenya. And each of us had like what today is $10, nothing else. >> Betsy Anthony: You made it through this train journey. You boarded a ship. And you sailed for two weeks? >> Jill Pauly: Two weeks on a Nazi ship. They had us controlled. For $10 a person, where are you going to g o? They had to pool the money to get a hotel room for the night. Must have been six people in the hotel room. Where are you going to go? There was no place to go against the Nazi ship. >> Betsy Anthony: I want to make sure we keep moving along and talk about Kenya but before we go to Kenya, can you tell us the story about the captain who heard you singing on the ship? >> Jill Pauly: Oh, yeah. The best is yet to come. You saw that picture of us on the ship. When I thought about it, and I've been thinking about it, I was very happy because it was lovely. There was sunshine and water. But before we got to the sunshine and the water, I have to tell you about my mother's reaction when we were put on the ship, went on the ship. All the Jews were lower deck, under the lower deck, and humanity was up above. And she got furious. But she couldn't do anything about it. I remember she got very angry. And we had a lot of problems on the ship. It was not simple. It was not simple at all. My little cousin, who is a donor here, he was 18 months old. He was a troublemaker. He was a child born in 1937. His mother never had time. He was into everything. He almost fell into the ocean. Inge pulled him back. His favorite thing was lying -- going on the deck with the older people sitting in deck chairs. He would get underneath and kick them. >> [Laughter] >> Betsy Anthony: He was a boy. 9 >> Jill Pauly: Under the circumstances, the adults kept trying to subdue him. The more they subdued him, the wors e he got. You had to be in the cabin with him. It was awful. >> [Laughter] >> Betsy Anthony: As I understood it, your mom was afraid she might need to subdue you because of your singing. What was that? >> Jill Pauly: Yes. But she didn't. >> Betsy A nthony: She taught you. >> Jill Pauly: My grandmother taught me to sing. You must remember, five and a half years in the house with a child, my grandmother. She was fabulous. She kept me happy. She sang with me. She sewed with me. She danced with me. She cooked. She was totally attentive to me. >> Betsy Anthony: And you had a great voice. >> Jill Pauly: I had a good voice. I come from a musical family. And she sang -- I didn't speak early. I sang early. So when I got on the boat, when I was left alone, I started singing. Mmm. I was picked up by the captain. He heard me singing. He asked for my mother to come and see him. She was terrified. She didn't know what it was about. And she went up there. He asked her if I would sing for the crew. Well, she couldn't say no , yo u know. A problem arose, a big problem. My uncles in Cologne who were very Orthodox and very musical sang the whole Passover Haggadah with me, taught it to me in music. Probably what I was singing. It was a month after Passover. And I learned we were going to the red sea. So this whole thing came to life. I wanted to see the red sea. It didn't happen. My mother was so afraid that I would sing Hebrew songs. So they took me to a cabin all night, the two grandmothers and my mother and an aunt. They tried to separate the folk songs from the Hebrew songs. >> Betsy Anthony: German folk songs. >> Jill Pauly: From the Hebrew songs and told me just to sing those German folk songs. And you know, I did. I don't know if I understood them or not. But here I am. Nothing happened. I remember one night -- and the lady that's still living . She's 97. S he said, ﬁNo, dear. You did it every night until you got off the boat. ﬂ >> [Laughter] >> Betsy Anthony: And when you got off the boat, you were in Mombasa. >> Jill Pauly: Yes. I remember seeing a man in a European suit and hat. And that was my father. Everybody else was in the garb of the country. >> Betsy Anthony: Your father was already there. >> Jill Pauly: He got th ere a month ahead of us. >> Betsy Anthony: So you remember seeing him as you got off of the ship. >> Jill Pauly: Yes. >> Betsy Anthony: I want to make sure we can talk a little about Kenya. Maybe we can start talking about how did your family establish itself there . >> Jill Pauly: Well, it's very complicated for me to really explain how we were so lucky and had the money left. I only learned this two years ago. The money that was smuggled into Holland, first of all, supported the seven people that were there who couldn't work, which is a whole different history. When we got the permission to get into Kenya, each person that was taken in you had to pay 50 British pounds security money. The list that went to Kenya was about 26 people. >> Betsy Anthon y: Of your family. >> Jill Pauly: My family and the woman who got us out, her family. They were rejected. The story came out 70 years later. Her family was not -- the woman who saved all of us, her family was not saved b ecause they were rejected. She suffered very badly because of those family members that survived that knew she went with the Bergs to Kenya and didn't save her mother and father and sister. She suffered terribly. But now we know why. The sister had -- what's it called? Epilepsy. T hat's why she was rejected from Kenya. And the parents wouldn't leave the sister. >> Betsy Anthony: I see. >> Jill Pauly: So we wer e 19 people that got into Kenya. 10 >> Betsy Anthony: What did you do? >> Jill Pauly: With the money that was left, they pooled it. They couldn't buy a farm and pay for it. They didn't have enough left. They put a downpayment on a farm, a big farm. That helped us tremendously because they did it right away. I think they must have had a deposit on the farm before the war broke out. They put a deposit on the farm before the last two uncles came to Kenya. They were on the last ship out of Germany. >> Betsy Anthony: The war break out in Kenya is also significant because at the time Kenya was a British colony. So once the war starts and Britain enters the war, things change in Kenya for the refugees living there. Can you tell us how? >> Jill Pauly: Yeah. Kenya let in 1,000 European refugees. When we came, six weeks later the war broke out. All the men were picked up and put into a camp. We became enemy aliens. They didn't know the difference between Jews and non -Jews. We were all enemy aliens. >> Betsy Anthony: Because? >> Jill Pauly: There was a reason. I found it here at the museum. The Germans were stealing Jewish identities and crawling into allied countries. They didn't know who was who. So they had to keep a very close eye -- >> Betsy Anthony: So any German citizen was considered an enemy , Jewish or not. >> Jill Pauly: Right. >> Betsy Anthony: So your father and his siblings were farming this farm. But once that happened, didn't his duties change? He had new obligations. >> Jill Pauly: Yes, yes. As soon as they settled on the farm -- by the way, they were in this camp where all the German Jewish men were put. You couldn't get out until you had a job with the British authority , either on a farm somewhere or -- and in our case they let the five men out because we had our own property. They interned them, the families, all of them, all of us , for t he duration of the war. We could not leave the farm without written permission. >> Betsy Anthony: Wow. However, you and Inge went to boarding school. Isn't that right? >> Jill Pauly: We went to boarding school but we didn't board. We lived with famil ies. >> Betsy Anthony: I see. Ok. But you didn't live with your family. >> Jill Pauly: No, with boarding families. First two were not so good. The third one was fine. She came to visit me in America , the third one. That was about five years until t he grandparents had died. And then mother moved to Nairobi. >> Betsy Anthony: Joined you there so you could live with your mother. >> Jill Pauly: Yes. >> Betsy Anthony: I know under British rule there was also problems with anti -Semitism and racism. You told me a story about your father having some problems. >> Jill Pauly: Oh, we all had problems. >> Betsy Anthony: Lots of problems. >> Jill Pauly: My father had a personal problem. He was a white man but he was swarthy. He wasn't snow w hite. When he worked on the farm, which he did all day, he turned very, very dark. He had brown eye s and black hair. The British were very racist towards the Indians that lived in Kenya. And there were many, many, many Indians. So they didn't ask him any questions. They just looked at him. And whenever we enter ed-- he went into any official place, they kicked him out. And when we were in school, he would come and visit us. He would let us know which hotel he would meet us at in town. We would go there and I would say, " Papa, why are you sitting outside?" I wanted to be inside the pretty hotel. He said, " They kicked me out again." He had tremendous problems with the racism. >> Betsy Anthony: You've told me before that the film "Nowhere in Africa" really speaks -- >> Jill Pauly: It tells the story. >> Betsy Anthony: I don't know if any of you have seen that film . It came out in 2000 -- >> Jill Pauly: 2002. It won an academy award for best foreign film. >> Betsy Anthony: An excellent film. 11 >> Jill Pau ly: Very much about my youth in Kenya. I just had a thought about the racism in Kenya. It was interesting because some of the British people were really, really nice and helped us a lot. Some of them were very racist. The newspapers were terribl y anti -Semitic. And I had it in school. It filtered down to the children. >> Betsy Anthony: Sure. Jill, I'd like to give our audience some time to ask questions. If it's ok with you, I will say just one more thing. When you left Kenya, you were 14 years old. >> Jill Pauly: 15. >> Betsy Anthony: 15 years old. It was just before the uprising so there were tensions. >> Jill Pauly: The uprising was in 1952. We left in 1947. And the family left the farm, didn't sell it because they wanted to keep it. They loved it. But they lost it. It completely devaluated. So they lost everything they had twice. And they had to start all over again i n the states. >> Betsy Anthony: That's the part I want to ask a bunch of questions about, however, I think we shou ld turn it over. >> Jill Pauly: Ok. >> Betsy Anthony: If you -- is that ok with you? >> Jill Pauly: Yes. >> Betsy Anthony: Ok. If you would like to ask a question, please raise your hand and wait for the microphone to be passed to you. We need you to use them so that we can hear you. I'll actually repeat your question to make sure everyone hears it and that Jill hears it. So with that, does anyone have a question for Jill? >> Do you still sing? >> Betsy Anthony: Do you still sing? >> Jill Pauly : No. >> [Laughter] >> Betsy Anthony: You just are saying that. >> Jill Pauly: No. I only sing if somebody sings with me. [Laughter] It didn't become my career. No. >> Betsy Anthony: Another question here. >> Your name is beautiful, Gisella. Why did you change your name? >> Jill Pauly: Because of anti -Semitism. I absolutely couldn't survive in the school with my name. >> You just chose -- >> Jill Pauly: I cried one whole year every single day. My sister picked me up after school. I was always crying. And one day she came out and she said, "You know what? From now on you're Jill." >> Betsy Anthony: Was that in Kenya? >> Jill Pauly: Yeah, in Kenya: >> One more quick -- >> Jill Pauly: I didn't have the problem here. I have to emphasize that I grew up to be quite a tough kid. Uh -huh. I had a lot of experiences. The last one was when I was about 12, just the right age. There was a girl that tormented me. She had a thing with Jews. And even as a child, I couldn't figure out -- what does she know about Jews? There aren't any Jews here. I was the only Jewish kid in school and what is it about me that's so important? You know? She just was a nasty girl. Really nasty person. And we were on a hockey team. >> [Laughter] >> Jill Pauly : Sports were very, very important. We had sports at the school, three, four days a week. We were playing a game. We must have been on opposite sides of the team. She hit me in my shins with her hockey stick on purpose. And that was the last time she ever hit me. >> [Laughter] >> Jill Pauly: I beat the crap out of her. >> [Laughter] [Applause] >> Jill Pauly: I don't know. She might have grown up an anti -Semite but she had her experience, too. >> [Laughter] 12 >> Betsy Anthony: That's a story I never heard. >> [Laughter] >> Your property, your family owned it for 400 years. Who owns it now? >> Jill Pauly: My family didn't own it for 400 years. They lived in the area for 400 years. It was my father's generati on that became wealthy. My grandfather was a small -time businessman. It didn't make him rich, just had it. Later, oh, yes. After the war came, the restitution money. And the land was in the courts for years. My family won the court case and they sent money. It was divided. And then one of my uncles went back to visit, good friends, old friends that I'm still in touch with. They didn't get the value. So that's what happened. Everything was taken. Houses. The day they got the letter on the 1st of January 1938, everything that the family ever had became the property of the German government. >> Betsy Anthony: I see a hand in the back. >> Hi there. First of all, thank you for sharing your story with us. You both sort of touched on going back to -- you're going to have to tell me how to pronounce the name of the town you're from. But I was interested in that part of your story if you could tell us a little bit about that. >> Betsy Anthony: You're interested in her returning in the last couple of years? Lechenich? >> Sorry about that. >> Betsy Anthony: That's a great question. Why don't you tell us about returning there. >> Jill Pauly: I returned first time in 1982. We were having a personal crisis in the family. That strengthened me. I sa id, "I f I can go through this, I go back to Germany." And my husband's cousin was working for the Israeli embassy. I was for five years, twice I think. He kept inviting us. So we went. And, of course, we both went back to where we came from. We drove into the town. I had read somewhere -- this was 1982 -- that the Germans really don't like -- they feel invaded when people come back and want to see where they came from. And I must have read that. And I decided I'm going to the police department. He said I was crazy. I said, I'm going to the -- the police was right next to the house. He said, ﬁWhat are you going to do with the police department? ﬂ I said , ﬁ I'm going to ask somebody to go with me. ﬂ I don't want to be invasive. I don't want to be rude. But I'd like to see the house. S o there was a young policeman there. He was very nice. He said, "I don't have to go with you.." I said, "Yes, please." And he did. And it's a good thing. I don't know -- because ever since then she's never let me back in the house. >> Betsy Anthony: Really? So the first time when he went with you -- >> Jill Pauly: She got scared and let me in the house. >> Betsy Anthony: And you tried again? >> Jill Pauly: The last time, a couple of years ago, my friend went with me, the lady who invited me. She's the granddaughter of the man who was in the field with my uncle who was photographed. Ok? She was with me. And she said, "Come on . Sh e'll let me in." I said, " She's not going to let me in." She knocked. She wouldn't let us in. >> Betsy Anthony: Wow. >> Jill Pauly: And I spoke that night. I was invited to speak to the community. The schools were not successful. I spoke at the schools. The kids had their internet. They saw my bio. It wasn't successfu l. I couldn't reach them. That was ok. They were polite. But the town, the group, about 300 people came. I had a wonderful moderator like you. It was very successful. And they asked me all sorts of questions. >> Betsy Anthony: That's great. >> Jill Pauly: And probably want to know how I felt. It took me a very long time to be able to articulate the feelings I have. It's a custom in our home to honor the dead by visiting cemeteries once a year. So my mother always asked us go back to the cemeteries. Because she said if we didn't, they would be encroached. She was right. I went back. In Cologne, I didn't have anyone that I knew in Cologne in the cemeteries but I went back, several. 13 Then these people asked me when I spoke would I like to come back to live in Lechenich. And I said, "Why?" I said i t's very nice of you but I would be cut off from my world from my people. I have children. I have no roots here. I never built roots here. I don't want to live here. If I want to live anywhere, if it's not the United States, I'll go to my ancestral homeland which is Israel. Ok. The second question was: Do you get homesick for Germany? What do you think? >> [Laughter] >> Betsy Anthony: I think we can figure tha t out. >> Jill Pauly: I'm visiting there. It's a beautiful country. The people are nice to us. I like visiting there. And in the future I hope the relations with Germany stay the way they are now, which is great. But for Jews to go back, you go to the cemetery, people are buried there. There is no growth. There is no cousins. There is no ancestors. There's nothing left f or Jews. So you have to start from scratch. >> Betsy Anthony: I'm afraid we have to stop here. Jill, thank you so much. Every time I hear you speak I learn something new. Thank you for spending time with us and thank you all for coming. [Applause] You deserved that. It's important to hear from survivors directly. It's a privilege and an honor that you would do this for u s. Thank you all for coming here today. We hope you come back. Remember that we have our First Person progr am every Wednesday and Thursday -- please wait ; please wait -- a t 11:00 a.m. u ntil the middle of August. It's our tradition here at First Perso n that our First Person has the last word but before I turn the mic back to Jill for the last few words I want to let you know that we'll be here to talk and answer questions. But, please, come up to Jill if you would like to meet her or ask a question up here at the front of the room. And when Jill is finished with her statement, I'm going to ask you all, if you don't mind, to stand. Our photographer Joel comes up here and takes a wonderful picture of Jill facing this way with you all as her backdrop. It's really beautiful. If you remember that, after she gives us her last word, please do that. So, Jill? >> Jill Pauly: Well, I thought about it while I was pulling weeds in my garden this morning. You know, some very, very brilliant people established this museum for the reason that the survivors who were involved wanted to give back to the country that they were able to start their lives new. They wanted to leave something for future generations to learn about what evil can do. I've been coming he re now for 21 years. And what I see is that this place, this museum, is getting more modern by the day; that the world is having more and more problems by the day and that youngsters can come here with the little second brain that they carry around and instead of looking at your favorite things all day, study, learn. Let this place be a beacon for your future. The more you know, the easier it gets in life. That's all I have to say today. >> Betsy Anthony: Thank you, Jill. [Applause]
