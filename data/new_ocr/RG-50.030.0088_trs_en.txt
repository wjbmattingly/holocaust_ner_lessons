ISRAEL GRUZIN June 30, 1994 Q: Can you tell us your name and where and when you were born? A: I would be delighted. My name is Israel Gruzin. I born in Lithuania, in Slobodka, they say in a place I born in 1928, December the 28th but now I am putting myself on May the 4th, and I am going to tell you the story. Q: You're going to tell us the story later? A: Right. Q: Tell us a little bit about your life in Slobodka and about your family and your brothers and sisters, if you have any? A: I had a brother, of course. I was born in Lithuania, in Slobodka, in Vilijampole. We had a normal life. My father was not a millionaire but he made a nice living. He was doing some business with Russians and things like this, and it was binders from boot sales and selling this from the houtgarba(ph) to make leather out of it. I was going to school. I was going, of course, to Cheder, a Hebrew school and my brother the same thing. And we was going on a normal life. Of course, we had the little- the Lithuanians was not always with Jews. There was stories all over the place, but we had a normal life and living like normal people, and then, of course, in 1940 came the Russians because the war started already with the Germans. It was not a war yet, but when the Germans came to Poland -- but the Russians came to Lithuania and then the Russians occupied Lithuania close to a year, and then the war started in 1940. Q: Tell me what changed when the Russians came. A: It was a little different because you will -- I was going to a, to Hebrew school and then all of a sudden I was going to a Jewish school. They are cutting down on the religious part. They were trying to make all the children like sort like patriotic and, of course, when you're young you think is the future. But my father was always against the regime because of Communism. In fact, he got arrested one time. One time he got a chicken he was carrying this to the street and he was stopped. What do you have a chicken for? And he was afraid to tell everything to go to officially. They arrested him and after a couple hours, but they let them out. They didn't want to get the men for the chicken. You can imagine my father didn't care much for the Communists. But I was not myself. I liked the movie and things like that. But it was really normal. It was a little different with the new regime, but I was too young to see the difference. Q: Let me ask you to go back before the Russians came. You said there was a lot of 2 Antisemitism? A: There was because I can experience to start with, because I remember my father bought a bicycle for my brother. I was the younger and he was a year older. We were riding one time and I was saying, let me ride, let me ride, and all of sudden there was a few boys, not Jewish, and one of them got a stick and put it right in the springs and he broke the bicycle, and like young boys, of course, we chasing them. You broke the bicycle. How come you broke the bicycle? And where I was living in -- we got a little farther out -- was a church and we chased them to the church and, of course, course the police came out and let the two buys in and he put the foot in this door and he told us, go away you Zyds. I told them and this time, of course, I spoke. I forgot ŒLithuanian, I was going born there-- them I told him he broke the bicycle and he kept saying, go away. Of course, I couldn™t fight him. It was experience. We came back home and my father took this bicycle to the man that fixed the bicycle and fixed it. But you had a feeling like you were always not so welcome, like because I'm Jewish. Q: Did you have Lithuanian friends? A: Like I said, I was neighbors with a few of them, but in general I was in the Cheder. But in the area I was living there was Jewish people. But we had a few people from the ________ a restaurant there. His son was a little friendly with us, and we were playing as children, but didn't have too many Lithuanian friends. Q: Did you hear about the Germans and the Nazis while the Russians were there? A: Oh, of course, in 1933 when the Russians came into Poland. Of course, my father was a middle-aged man and he talked about it with my mother, and he showed the papers a little bit, in the Jewish papers and the Lithuanian papers what was going on in Poland, the liquidations and the killing over there. And it was we started. A lot of Jewish run away from Poland and come to Lithuania. In fact, when the army, the Polish army, fight the Germans they came to Lithuanian because some of them didn't want to stay with the Germans. But most of them was happy to have the Germans in Poland. Q: You were very young. Did you hear your parents talking about it and did you read the newspapers? A: Yes. I couldn't understand a little bit and there was politic involved, and I could hear it and feel it, and when I see in the, whatever, I saw in the paper I realized this that we are not welcome. Something is going to come back and my father kept saying what was the next step. He didn't realize that the Germans were going to attack the Russians this time, but when the war started and they start feeling that the Germans are coming. But my father reading the papers and knowing what is going on. It's time to leave everything and run because what is going on in Poland is maybe going to be the same thing here in Lithuania. And we had a horse and wagon, and I have a lot of stories to tell. We had a 3 small little horse and we are using it to take the coals from -- it was a little like a pony. It was like a dog. You talk to him like a dog and this horse was doing things that were believable. And my father had two horses but my father took the smaller horse and the wagon and take the few things we can take with us, and we made the journey to run away from the Lithuania. And the Germans were always bombing the airport, and a lot of Jews start running to get away from the army. Q: And this is in 1941? A: This is in 1941. And only the same time these bombs was falling and, of course, the Lithuanians were so happy to see the Germans coming, they're sabotaging the Russian Army tanks, putting on fire and burning 6 the tire and shooting on them. And all of sudden their own rifles and putting on the Lithuania uniform and really taking advantage of the situation and start right away with the Jews, of course, but we didn't have enough -- it was too fast. We left. They day they started throwing the bombs, my father took the horse and wagon and we was going to get out of there. And we are running the streets with the Russian Army and we were going to Latvia. A lot of people in this area. You can go to Latvia and then to Minsk, and then from Minsk to White Russia, but we didn't make the journey so far. We just took that horse and wagon. We have involved with the Russian Army and then, of course, the Germans were bombing the streets and we were going through the hole. I say the Holocaust, dead people right away from the first time, and my mother, in fact, was shot, slit. The bomb cut in her leg we were running in this way. We were going in the same direction as the Russian army. There was always fires and dead people on the streets and a lot of them couldn't make it. You know, the soldiers and a lot of people riding the horses didn't make it. We kept on going and then, of course, we came to the border of Latvia. We came in at Minsk. There was a lot of Latvian people there, but we hear right away from the Gentile people that something going on, terrible things going on against the Jews, even in Minsk. But we were lucky and we were still going in the car with the Russians, the army. But the army was really practically 99 percent in a chaos, didn't know what they are doing. One was running right and one was running left, and then I remember one thi ng, that we were running, going with the wagon and two Jewish guys came over and said you have to give us a ride. My father said, Look, I got a little tiny horse. We have four people. We won't make it. They took out a revolver and they point it at my father. They said, look, you are going to sit down and we are going with you. Also because we can™t walk. They might look a little Communist inclined, I don't know. Maybe they are soldiers, and then we are running like this. Not running, driving and driving and driving and then, all of a sudden we had an attack with machine guns and I felt -- I was in the wagon with my mother and my brother and my father was driving the horse and the two men, and then all of a sudden we hear a something. We hear a scream and one of them says, Oy, Oy. We look and then he laying, fall back and a bullet went right in the man part, in this -- right in his, in the part, the men part, and it went in this -- excuse the expression -- right in where it aches for the men. He could feel the bullet. He could touch it. The other man said, don't do nothing. Drive faster the horse. Drive the horse, and then we were already in Latvia, and then we 4 stopped and they are still with us two days, and then this man stopped some other people and, of course, speak fluent Russian and they made us stop for a day, like a half a day and they said we should go closer to the water. And they took him out of the wagon and they said to us, they thanked us for the ride and giving them the ride and we left them right by the water. And I said, how can you leave them by the water? And he said, I made arrangements to the other side because the other side of the river, the Russian Army was a little bit more organized. It could start to fight back. It made like a zone to fight back, and we left them there. My father didn't want to leave the man. After all, he didn't know him and now the man is wounded, and they kept on saying -- I was a boy and I could see that it was his part and there was a bullet, and the other man was going to take it out and my father said, don't do it. You'll kill him. And anyway we left him by the edge of the water and we started going farther. We are already -- my father and my brother and my mother alone, and my father kept the tallis, you know, the tallis what you 9 wear, and he keep it on the wagon with him, and this he took with him. We are going there and then nobody to talk, but luckily my father was fluent in Latvian, is different, similar but different. My mother didn't speak Latvia, and I, of course, didn't and my brother didn't. Then he hear some from -- somebody told us ______ that we are Jewish. You are one of them. The Germans were not even there yet. We didn't know what was going on. And go there, make a left and a right there. And there was a farm and there was a Jew. Maybe he can give you directions. Anyway, we came over there. He had a farm and two sons and all kinds of animals there, chickens and cows and pigs, and all this. And there was a little town and the whole people looked like they like them over there because he was a very nice man. And my father said to him, what should we do? And he said, I am in the same boat like you are. The war was going on. We didn't know how long it was going to go. So stay with us for a while. And we stay for two or three days, and then on the other side of the farm was close to the water, maybe a quarter of a mile. And my father said to him, maybe we could go over to the other side. But we couldn't. He wanted to go over. The reason -- I skipped a little bit. The reason we came to this 10 place, he wanted to go to Latvia. The Russian go over to Latvia. There was bridge and the Russian Army exploded the bridge because -- then the tanks and the army. Their own people. There was a lot of Jewish, and on the bridge, we were lucky not to make the time on the bridge. If we were on the bridge we would be exploded too. Right before our eyes we saw the bridge collapsing and there was a lot of Russian people running around in their underpants, really. With their rifles and they couldn't even walk. They got on the other side. We remained on our side and the people on the other side, there was still the army holding the gun. But a couple days on the farm with this man I said to my father, let me see what was going on. And we took the little boat. We really wanted to go over. He said, I can't take anyone right now. I was going in the nighttime. I was not there and my father, said oh, my God, what is going on there? They are fighting with the Germans and ________ and the Jewish and he found out. And they couldn't make it back on the other side, but he came back with this man from the farm. And he came back and said, look, he said, it is bad. I am taking my horse and wagon and I am going. He had some people that came to him and said, ride it out from the 11 people. And we are left completely alone, and this was like in evening and I said to my father -- and my father's name was Heim(ph) -- and 5 he shake hands with him. I got my family and you have yours. I have to go my way. I can't take you where I'm going. We go where we can and then, of course, we made the journey to go back because we couldn't go to the other side. We were trying to go back from where we came. That's why I said the little horse was like a dog. We didn't know where to go and my father said to him, go horse. He didn't know where to go and he was afraid to ask for directions, things like this. And luckily like I said in the beginning, my father speaks Latvia, and we starting to move back in one little town and _____, the small towns. And all of a sudden we hear from the people, the Gentile people, the Germans are moving slowly. And then all of a sudden we see a German truck with soldiers and oh, my father said, we are already under the Germans. We caught from the Germans. We are going. My father was smart and took that horse and took some mud and smeared up the horse and made the wagon look like farmers and look not like Jewish people, because he hide the tallis that he had. We are going there and people are greeting us. People thought we are going from one _____, from one little 12 town to another little town.

And we are five going farther than them. We are going farther and they are going backwards. And they kept on saying in German ________, things like this. We knew how to speak German too and, of course, my father knew we are all right. But of course, my father knew more, but the Jewish and German is very similar. But in this experience we are going down to a house, a bag to grab it and saw it on the ground and it exploded. It was like a bomb. They didn't know if we are Jewish or not, but they didn't care. They were soldiers but when we came in to this town -- and we are still in _______ and someone from the windows up from the top, what are you doing? Someone will recognize us. We are not Latvia. There was a Russian man that said to my father, this Russian. It is now six o'clock. Nobody is allowed to be on the street. Move off to 13 the side because they are going to destroy you. My father understand stood Russian too and we moved over, right where we could in the corner, and the night came and wagons and the machine guns and the airplanes and the bomb. And German Army is so powerful, and this was in the morning. We saw people start moving. We saw civilian people also. Then we start going again with our horse. The journey to go back to Lithuania. And my father stopped and asked an old lady. Why didn't you have the directions? Are you not from here? And he said, no, to her. No, we're not from here, and she said oh, my God. Don't tell them that you are Jewish they. Are killing all the Jews and killing all the Jews. It's _____ in this little town and this little town. And my father, of course, explained to us, he said to us, go and don't ask nobody. If you are going to ask a question, where you are going, you will not be. Keep on going. I can give you good directions and you go over the highways. And we have to go where the army was. Don't ask for directions. My father didn't want to ask for corrections, and he put in the tallis for good luck and they were driving by us. He put in the tallis, you know, for good luck and driving by ourself. And all of sudden we see soldier and already the Partisans 14 and the Latvia people, they put in their uniform 6 and they're running and the flowers they got for the Germans, and the womens get all kind of _____ and they -- and then Partisans with rifles and knives came over to us, first with bicycle and come off the street because my father was making sort of like, sort of like ______.

Full of Jews. People with a lot of fences, sitting and telling a story. Oh, for this one, let's drink. In Lithuania, oh, this one let's, drink and, you know, opened up a bottle of some vodka. And my father was drinking and said to my brother and myself and to my mother, keep on moving, move, move, and he said keep on moving, to my brother, who was a little older.

We were maybe two or three foot away from him and then my father start running to him and he said oh, thank God. I get rid of them. Then we keep on going farther and we came into a little town. It was called -- this was already before we came, we passed the border because there were no border because the Germans already took over everything. They opened up all the borders. It was not Latvia. No one was guiding there. We came into the border there. Of course, we saw what was going on. We was scared. We saw dead people right and left, right and left.

When I went up in the roof -- I was young when we were living -- there was a little window to look out. I saw what was going on. They were kicking people and punching them around and putting them in the sections. And when I say from far away, I saw them coming around the fire, and two or five wagons around the building, and then the Germans. And they put a store on the building. They take the kerosene and gasoline and they put this building on fire, and they are jumping, live people. I'm sure four, five hundred people in the building, maybe more. When they bring down the hospital, they were laughing. 27 I could see. I was not far away. When people try to run to the window, they were shooting them. They were falling like a bag, like nothing. We saw this was going on and this was the small hospital. That's the way they liquidated the hospital. Then the big action came from the big ghetto and then, of course, they run around with the loudspeakers. And this time was already the ghetto organized. It was the Jew Police. In fact, my uncle -- he was not a plain person but he looked like a bit, looked German. Here a room for you, going to watch this street. You can watch the street. It should be quiet. People shouldn't stay in groups and talk. He was a quiet man, but thanks to him ______ this life too, in concentration camp. But the way it looked like because of him we went on the good side and my aunt went to the other side. And when they make the big action, they came out with loudspeakers and start saying everybody have to meet in this certain place. It was an empty place in the ghetto. They stage things like this. It was empty, where people used to play football. This was thought nothing but there was no _____. There was woods and cemetery not too far away, and they put all the people, everybody young and old and not sick, everybody have to be there. And they took out from 28 their houses, carry them out from the beds and, of course, they came back to the houses looked like the people were. There was thousand and thousand of people and they make a selection and they make people -- panicking people. Can't take nothing with you. When people get lost from each other, you can hear them saying mama, papa ______, you know, the Jewish name. There was a panic and this was early in the morning. It was maybe five o'clock in the morning the day before. It was not light outside. You have to go to this truck. We came to this place where it was standing, couple trucks for the Germans and the Partisans, and there was the Germans standing with the little stick. And everybody have to got to face him, and you right, left, right, left, and the Jewish Police have to take the group, 30 or 40 people, up to this man. There was a few of them and it looked like my uncle, and he run over to us, because he was this time a little room for us and he said follow me, beginning with me, and 11 somehow _______ he thought maybe he could make a move or something. The Germans said we should go to the right side or the left side, I don't know, but we followed my uncle and we went to the right side. We saw the people go to the left. They are treating them more awful then they are 29 treating us. On the right side we saw -- it was looser, the ghetto, more and the left was closer the other side. And he separate into thousand and thousand of people, and they open up the gates and put the people back in the clean ghetto, back where they burned the hospital. It was still there and they moved them in there. And it was deep in the night and everything starts falling to quiet, and they came to the right side and they said you can go if you have the houses where you live. Go back to your homes and we are still in the ghetto and they was pulling on the people in the left side, and _______ stopping the soldiers, the Partisans. And like I say, the Lithuanians were maybe ______ with the Germans and they put them in the other side, and we went back. Of course, in the panic and we missing -- my father is not here with my mother, and my father and my brother were lucky this time and we were pulled back to our home. And like I say, we are not too far away from the smaller ghetto and other people going to houses here. The whole night screaming and panicking and so like in the morning, they opened up in the morning and they put them all in the line and put them in the Nitenfort. There was house, I don't know the number, but it was, you couldn't see from one end to the 30 other, there was so many people. This was small ______ babies and they did everything. This was a big action, they call it. It was big the action. Q: Did you know where they were going?

I didn't see good people. There was maybe a few. I didn't see a good German where I was, but I won't go into it, and they took these people and start them marching them to the Nitenfort, and we were still remaining in the ghetto. This was our luck, and in the morning the ghetto was completely empty, the small ghetto, and we could hear in the night the machine guns and the shooting, because the Nitenfort was not really far away from the ghetto. It was just really a couple kilometer up the hill. And sometimes playing, sometimes there I didn't know what was going to happen there, and you could see from the Nitenfort and see Slobodka. It was not so far away. And we could hear the shooting going on and the killing and, of course, nobody came back from there. And sometime we knew what was going on even before they are taking people in the Germany and the Austria and marching them between the two lines, two ghettos. 31 They were killing them over there too, and where were we going. We knew already. This night you don't tell people that they are going be killed. You couldn't make any move. If anybody move, your would lose you're life. And now I was walking down, and I liked to carve. Now, I was walking down, but I always like too carve and make airplanes and things like this.

I made a butterfly and an airplane and they keep on saying, keep on doing, keep on doing. I was a couple days and they took from everybody. I had a imagination and I always like to look at the airplanes, and when I was younger I dreamed of becoming pilot. Can you imagine me a pilot? But I had a dream. Who knows, if the war wouldn't be there 33 or something. And I was doing these airplanes for them and I took maybe four or five models. They gave me soft wood. ______ I never worked with this.

End of Tape #2 29 Tape #3 Q: You were describing this bunker, this mountain? A: Right. They are building up, of course, coming in with big train and filling it up and soften up and build. You go up the mountain and then when this was done, they put like a little layer of grass and put in sticks, metal sticks. All that was maybe a mile was metal that was maybe two or three foot long, all over.

Later on they come bury the whole thing in the ground and from the outside stick out just the mountain and all this cement was built up so heavy. They put layers of grass and then when you looked at this, it look like a mountain, like a normal hill. Only sometimes we are were doing this type of work and we had the Jewish -- this was really like we have the Jewish system -- it was really the time people used to fall in the cement and never came out. And I think hundreds of people buried. Almost I fall in there but I was lucky this time again and wasn't working there.
