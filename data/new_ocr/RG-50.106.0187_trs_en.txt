And they picked me out because I had blue eyes, blond, I had ponytails. I looked like a typical German girl. That™s the only thing I can explain that. And then he gave, they gave me flowers and I had to go up on the podium and bring Hitler the flowers. And he hugged and kissed me. And then I felt a real part of it. It was an honor to do that. I didn™t know what, what future lie ahead of me. So then I told all my classmates, I gave Hitler flowers and just bragged about it you know. Q: Your classmates weren™t there? I know you said you were part of the girl scouts? A: Yeah. Q: Was that like a Hitl er youth organization? A: Yeah, yeah, they had to belong to it.

And they said if anyone of you, your parents have Jewish people in their b asement, you have to tell us Interview with Edith Langer 23 or you will be next and you will get nailed on the table. And my sister was really afraid. So she lifted her hand and she said we have. Q: This was in the classroom. A: Yeah. Q: To the two Nazi soldiers? A: So she gave i t away. They never showed up til 3:00 in the morning. Q: That night. A: That night. The same night. They broke the door down. They didn™t even wait for anybody open the door. They just stormed into, into the house. There was three Nazi guys and they took the Jewish people out. We were, our house were on a bank of a street, the driveway was right in front of our house. They lined the Jewish people up on one side and they lined us up on the other side. In nightgowns. That™s why it was summer, it wasn™t cold. And they took a machine gun and they killed the Jewish people. Right there in front of us. We were not, not supposed to cry or help them. They said if you get out of line, you get shot. So we all stood frozen in one line. And then the one guy took a pistol, held to my mom and said I shoot you. And my mom said Jesus help me. And the guy dropped his gun. I don™t know why he dropped the gun, but he dropped it. And he couldn™t shoot it anymore . And then he went, my father said if you want to Interview with Edith Langer 24 shoot anybody you have to shoot me because I™m the one who got the Jewish people in our house. So they shot him. They shot him right in front of us. We couldn™t say anything , we couldn™t cry, we couldn™t do nothing. Otherwise we would have been killed too. And then the whistle go up, one guy put a whistle in his mouth. The whistle go off. A truck came and they all had to go on the truck . Except my mom. My mom had to stay there and she went in the air raid shelter as a Red Cross nurse. She stayed there for four years . And we had to go. They drove us at farms. We had to do farm labor like child labor. At ten years you had to milk five cows in the morning, learn how to drive a tractor. How to plow with horses. We did that all at ten years old. First I cried. I was miserable. And then I got used to it. And but while we were driving out they put gasoline on your house, they put your house on fire. So we lost everything. My mom had to find a room somewhere. And we were at these farms. We are all separated. They put us on four different farms. And that now a big tru ck we we nt. And you couldn™t escape. There was nowhere to escape. So we stayed there and I was there for four years. And I got confirmed there you know. So I learned the good work ethic. That™s where I did learn. You know somebody said you have to go to work 5:00, I would be there 5:00. That™s what I did learn. So then after the war, my mom got a taxi. She went to it™s called the Bergersmeister office. You know who the Bergermeister is. Bergersmeister office. They had all the papers and she found out there where we were. And she went in this taxi and picked us all up. No warning. All of a sudden she was standing there. You know and I was super glad that I saw her again. And she took around and picked up all my sisters. My brother had run away. And my parents said he went to the Heights MB [ph], to American Legion. And we have never heard from him again. He went there and he disappeared. So he wanted no part of this. So we don™t know where he went. I have looked on the internet, trying to find him but I can™t find him. He might be dead also, cause Interview with Edith Langer 25 I™m now you know. So then we came home and I went to what is called in learning in the bakery. I learned how to bake in the bakery. Q: We™ll talk about post war in a minute. Can we just go back a little bit? Before this terrible thing happen and you saw German soldiers on the street, Nazi soldiers, what was your feeling. Did you think they were impressive? A: No we were afraid of them. Q: Why?

And I didn™t enjoy it very much first. Because you had to do all the dirty work first. We had to clean the bakery, wash the dishes, and do stuff like that. So I didn™t enjoy that, that much. But then after two years I begin to like it. Because it wa s artistic. You could do flours and learn that you know. And then I did first, I did cooking. The first two years, I forgot that. I did cooking. I wanted to be a chef first. And then the third year we had to do baking and I liked that better. So I took baking up for three more years. So I put myself five years through training.

Germany, you need eve rything a paper for. And here you say you can bake. You have to prove it. And you can bake. You know. He said you even can open your own bakery here.

And I traded English for cleaning. I cleaned her house and she sat me two hours down and talked, taught me English so I could learn English because I did not, I knew yes and no, that™s it. And Gerhard was the guy who took me over here. He made a date with me. And the minister gave me ten cents that night. He said keep the ten cents and call me if you get in trouble and I pick you up wherever you are. And Gerhard stupid of him, he went to a motel. He opened the door. I didn™t know what a motel was.

And the honeymoon night as I™m coming to bed, he baked 350 pounds of cookies. He baked all night cookies. It™s hard to believe it but that™s what he did. And the marriage was on a rocky boat all the time. We had, he was married to his mother. He was a mama™s boy. And Œ Q: Was he from Germany originally? A: Originally he was from Germany yeah. But he was in the army in Germany. And he also was in the army in the United States. He jus t in two armies. He didn™t like that, he didn™t like cold weather. So they sent him to Alaska.

I have two children, Doris and Ralph. They both don™t talk to me. Q: Because? Interview with Edith Langer 38 A: Because I got myself, 1971 I got myself divorced. I coul dn™t stand it anymore . Q: And did you stay in New Jersey? A: I stayed for one year with him. In th e bakery. Because he wasn™t a decorator and I was. So I had to, I wanted to teach him how to decorate cakes but he never learned. So after one year of it, I finally left. And I worked in another bakery in Flemington. And there I had to prove myself. They didn™t want any women bakers. Women bakers didn™t exist here for a while. So I had to work for one week and I made cookies and doughnuts and breads. After one week they said yeah , you have a job. So I stayed there. I only worked there for a half a year. But I did, I baby sat a family at night. And they have moved here to Maryland. That™s how I got to Maryland. And they moved to Maryland and they said well we want you to baby sit our kids again. And you can stay in our house. We™re building a house. They built a house but one short, one bedroom was short. I had to live with the daughter in one bedroom. And that™s what I didn™t want to do. So I went to a bakery in Ellicott City, Frederick™s or whatever it™s called. I went there, they are out of business now. But I went there and I, there in the bakery and I had to ice, ice cakes. Wedding cakes and birthday cakes. And the girl, who decorated t hem was sick one day. For the whole week. And I had to decorate the cakes. And the people came and said a fter, even after she came back, we want Edith™s cakes. So we had the clash there. So I left. I then opened my own bakery. In Aras Anna in Baltimore. And it was a laundry and I cleaned it all out and I put a bakery in there and but I couldn™t get any h elp. Help to, for me. I think I am perfectionist. So I didn™t, I c losed the door and I worked for fifteen years in, called Edelweiss bakery in Harford Road. And then I quit. And I was 74. Then I quit. That™s my life.

Or did they discuss about Hitler or about the Nazis or about the Jews, did people bring those topics up when you came to the United States. Edith Langer: Yeah. Q: How did you respond? A: I told them how it really was. Many people did not know that Hitler went at the small families like at the families like me and they said Hitler couldn™t be that bad. But I told them then and then the, history books they only say that he killed many Jews and put them, put them in concentration camps. And I knew that but then I told them my story and I have told to many people my story. They all would say ah but how, because I told it in churches. My story. I told it to youth groups.

Interview with Edith Langer 41 Q: The counseling was done in the United States? A: No in Germany. Q: In Germany. A: In Germany.

A: I don™t think it™s done enough. Like my own story has never been told in Germany. And the people should have known that. And I think that the SS should have been accountable for what they did.

A: You got my whole life story. Q: Do you have any advice to give others about Œ Interview with Edith Langer 55 A: Don™t let ever the Nazis, they get hold again. That™s my advice. Do anything to ke ep them down. Q: Do you think most of the Germans were against the Nazis, do you feel? A: Yeah, definitely. Once they knew the truth after the war, the truth came out. Then they all hated, they hated to be Germans. I hated to be German. And I think h ere™s a gir l named Gabby. She hates really to be German. Q: She was born in Germany? A: Yeah. She hated you to come here. Q: Because? A: Because I told her some negative about Germany. Q: She didn™t want tha t recorded. A: Yeah she didn™t want that. She™s off today. That™s a good thing. Q: Was she alive during the war? Does she have memories of the war? Interview with Edith Langer 56 A: She is younger than I am. She might be not. But she only heard bits a nd pieces. She never heard, I never told her the whole story. Because she is German and after the war, everybody said that all Germans killed the Jews. That™s everybody and that™s not so. I never killed anybody. And Gabby didn™t kill anybody so most of the Germans did not kill the Jews. There were a few soldiers who killed but you can™t get everybody in one cannot, that they all killed the Jews.

When you had Jewish people you were quiet about it. Q: You said your mother was quite religious. Was your dad just as religious as she was? A: No. Q: So why, how do you attribute his bravery? And his concern to what he did? A: Stupi dity. Interview with Edith Langer 57 Q: Stupidity? Because? A: Why did he have to say shoot me? That wasn™t brave in my eyes. That was plain stupidity. Q: What I was asking was, before that, what do you attribute the fact that he went to these people and offered them the basement? A: Kindness. He wanted, he must have known that the Jewish people got killed somehow. Q: Do you consider that a brave act on his part, that he sheltered? A: That was, but that was brave. That was brave but the way he confessed it and said shoot me. He should have kept his stupid mouth shut. Then he would still be living. I don™t know whe ther they would still be living. He™s older but Œ Q: You think the Nazi soldiers would have left him alone if he hadn™t said any thing, even though they kne w the Jews were in his basement? A: They weren™t ready to, he wasn™t ready to kill him because he dropped his gun by my mom. So he probably Œ Q: He probably wouldn™t have done anything at that point? Interview with Edith Langer 58 A: Wouldn™t have done anything, but him on a truck and get into farm labor or something you know. But he did it and there™s nothing we can do about it. Q: Were there other neighbors watching when this happened? A: No it was 3:00 in the morning. There was nobody around. We wore only nightgowns. They put us in nightgo wns on the truck. Q: That™s how you went to the farm, in a nightgown. A: Yeah I had to wear boy™s clothes because that™s all they had. Q: Did they ever talk to you about what had happened, about what your --- A: No they never said anything. Q: Did they know? A: I don™t know whether they knew. Q: What were their names? Do you remember? Interview with Edith Langer 59 A: Huchtsameyer. Q: As I said before anyt hing else before we close or A: No. Q: That is quite a story and we th ank you for doing this. Thank you very much. A: Well I can help some people. Q: I™m sure. Important story. This concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial interview with Edith Langer. (End)
