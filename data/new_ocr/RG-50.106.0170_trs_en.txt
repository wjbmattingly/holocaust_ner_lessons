Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 3A: I-It started -- he came in ™25, I-I was born in ™33, then they must have met before that. And there is all kind of story because my mother had two sister, and one sister married a -- a cousin from my father, coming from Poland , and I have photos where he -- he™s seen in -- in this Blaski, the other wearing peasant clothes, he had the nice, you know, jacket and the hat, etcetera. And presumably he was responsible also to bring this cousin to Belgium, too, who married the sister of my -- of my -- of my mother. I think it™s a -- a little complicated still. Q: Tell me about your mother™s family. A: Well, my fa -- mother family came from Poland , and they were all born in -- i-in Poland , and they came in -- in -- in Belgium. We have photos etcetera. I think also, ™25 - ™27. And I don™t know in ™27. Q: Because you said in the beginning your family goes back three generations. A: No, I thi -- I think it™s not correct. Q: Oh, okay. [laughter] A: I -- is not correct. Q: Okay. A: I think it™s two generations maybe. Q: It™s just your father. A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Q: Yeah. Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 4A: Yeah. Q: Tell me what kind of work your father did. A: Yes, he was a -- in the ladder, you know. I know that they work, you know, in a little room for 12 hours a day, etcetera. I think for -- for probably two or three years, before he enter in a very successful business of his own. You know, with -- you know, 20 workers or 30, which is -- Q: Also a ladder business? A: Yes, a ladder -- a -- a -- and a -- a ladder business. But then came a, you know, a past, you know, story that when he came to Belgium, as -- as I mentioned in another oral history, he went directly to work in the mines, coal mines in Liege for -- for a year. And he had always a connection with the mining industry, not because -- we talk about later, that there was [indecipherable] in the last family who -- who were miners, but h-he took me practically everywhere -- ev ery year back in the mines, you know, to -- to see what™s up, I mean, etcetera. And [indecipherable] were before -- a-after we went in the mines, etcetera. That h-he became very, as I mentioned, very successful, but again I -- with all those document, I have no proof that -- of the fact that he went directly to Liege and work in the mines. This is not in the archive of the -- of the Belgium government. They ja -- mentioned that he resided in Brussels, that he had this job, that before he went, there were exchange of letter with the Polish consulate, etcetera. And we mentioned that his salary was X Belgian franks a year, and that he Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 5was a good worker [indecipherable] and that they will provide housing, etcetera, which was essential for somebo dy to -- to come to -- to Belgium from Poland . Q: Okay, now you were born in 1933. A: Yeah. Q: Let™s talk about your family at that time, was it a religious family? A: No, they were not religious. It was not that. They follow, let™s say, some practice, okay? Q: Such as? A: Passover, Bar Mitzvah. I -- I was Bar Mitzvah , too. I was very keen to have all the gifts, but anyway , it was a -- in the Brussels Jewish family, an event, because not only the ceremony took place at the Grand Synagogue in Brussels, but it tooks three -- three days. You know, the first days with -- the banquet was for the immediate family and friends. The second was for my father clients, you know, and the third one was for all his workers. So, you know, th -- it was a big -- a big things. Q: But this was after the war. A: No -- Q: You™re talking about your Bar Mitzvah ? A: Yes, bar mi -- it was just after the war. Q: Was just after, okay, let™s get back to before the war. A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, before the war? Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 6Q: Yeah. A: Yes. As I mentioned, th-the family of my moth er, they came from Warsaw in ™25 - ™27, the mother, the father and three sister, okay? And -- Q: So these are your grandp arents, and your aunts. A: Grandparents, correct, and actually they were all employed by my father, you know, and -- but I was born in the baseme nt of a li -- of the apartment from my grandfather, etcetera. Q: Where -- where did you -- you live in Brussels? In the center, or -- A: In -- in one of the -- yes, in -- in Brussels area. Q: In the city? A: In the city, wa -- Q: In a house or an apartment? A: In -- in an -- a small apartment [indecipherable] a small apartment, but I was born at my grandmother place, and apparently on August the sec ond, but my father went to the city hall on the third, then a-all the papers said I was born on the third. How about that? A-Again, an administrative little problem. And we live in the [indecipherable] some kind of basement and -- until we moved to a -- a bigger apartment. This must be then in -- in ™35. [indecipherable] was born in thir -- ™35. Q: Yeah. Would you describe your family at that time, pre-war, as being middle class - Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 7A: Oh yes. Q: -- upper class? A: My father was certainly middle class, okay? He -- he prosper at that time. I have only remembrance that h-he was very succe ssful. Many things, all the photos that I have, we spent at the seaside, you know, in Belgium. I remember at that time, you know, there was all those ballroom dancing, etcetera and I remember each time I had -- they -- they -- they -- they put in front of the bed all the balloons, all the gift, etcetera, a-a-and -- and things like that. Later, it was a very large room, and my sister was in the same room, you know? Q: Now, this is the sister that was born after you? A: No, no, no, that™s my half sister -- Q: Your half sister. A: Who came in ™37. And I was -- Q: So did -- did your family ha -- did your parents have any more children after you? A: No, no. Q: No. A: And she was pregnant when she was de ported, yes. That™s -- has been also documented by doctors and all that. Then, many things about -- very nice upbringing, you know, spoiled, like [indecipherable] by my mother, a-and my father, certainly. And -- and the rest of the -- the family, my grandfather was a clockmaker, something Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 8like that, yes, a-and the other wa -- you know, as I mentioned work in my fa-father business, they never make it at the same le vel that my father, in term of revenue, income, etcetera. And then came the -- the war, you know. Q: Yeah, well, we™ll get to that in a minute. Were your parents Zionists? A: Let us say that because he had one of -- of his brother in -- in -- in -- in Israel, I think he was more or less Zionist. He wa s a member of the -- the Jewish labor bun -- bund [indecipherable]. And this is a very interesting question, because it led to a development later on, when his -- or certainly my mother, were convince that th-there will be not, you know, harm, you know, and therefore th-the -- there was some distance between Zionists, you know, and th e belief that th-the y will be, you know, recognized as Belgian citizen and so on and s -- and so forth. Then, how -- however, my -- our sister was a leader of the Hashomeritz -- Q: Hatzair ? A: -- ye -- Hatzair , and you know, she -- she develop into a fantastic girl, and they were -- they were debate if they have to leave for Israel or not, st -- you know? But I think she was one who says we have to go, but it was too late. Too late. Q: What language is it you speak at home? A: At home I speak French with my wife, and she speak Fre -- Q: No, no, I meant when you were growing up. A: Grow -- oh, French. Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 9Q: You spoke French. A: French. But I unders -- began to understand Yiddish, because all my father and -- and -- and his friends were speaking Jewish. Q: From Poland [indecipherable] A: Fr-From Poland , and -- and they were in Brussels, th-th-then they finally -- yes, they were speaking -- Q: No, I know [indecipherable] A: -- yeah, yeah. They were speaking Yi-Yiddish, I never learned Yiddish, I learned a bit of Hebrew because of the Bar Mitzvah and the gift, but -- but nothing, nothing else, it was French, I wa -- you know. Q: Did you live in a -- I know you were very young -- A: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah Q: -- but I™m asking you questions about the time you were very young, but did you live in a Jewish neighborhood, or a non-Jewish neighborhood -- A: No, non-Jewish neighborhood. The -- the Jewish, they were -- the only strict Jewish neighborhood was in Antwerp, you see? Then, in Brussels it was very -- Q: Mixed. A: -- integrated, and the other center was in Liege, was also integrated, there -- there -- there was no -- not any form of -- of -- of residences in the street for -- for Jewish, or something like that, no. Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 10Q: When you were very young, did your parents belong to a synagogue? A: No, I don™t think so. No, I don™t think so. Q: But you still observed Passover? A: Yes, Passover, but that was done by the grandmother, etcetera, not by -- by -- by her family. Was -- Q: So you remember going over to the relatives for the holiday? A: Oh yeah, for s -- the holidays, that is -- Q: What about the Sabbath, did you observe the Sabbath at home? A: No, no, never. No, no, no, no. Q: And did you have Jewish frie nds when you were very young? A: Yes. Yes, and this can be seen by photograph, etce tera. Yes, and -- Q: Again, I™m talking pre-war. A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I went to the seaside and etcetera from -- from -- from [indecipherable] Q: And -- and no -- and non-Jewish friends, also? Both? A: This I cannot really remember until later. Q: Yeah, because you were still young, yeah. A: Un-Until later, until later. Q: So what are your very first memories? A: Of? Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 11Q: Of life. A: Of life, a-as I say, I -- from ™33 til let™s say 1940, it was a good memory of a good -- you know, family, and -- surrounded by love and unders tanding and -- and vacation and all kind of things which -- which -- Q: So you were a happy child, yeah. A: Absolutely, I™ll say -- Q: Would you consider yourself an independ ent child at that time, or were you more attached to your parents? A: No, not at the -- not at that time. The independence came much later, after -- even after the war. Q: Mm-hm. A: After the -- Q: You were still young. A: Yeah -- Q: Yeah, yeah. A: -- after the war, yeah. A-And -- Q: And so what year did you start school? A: Well, school, that was the -- the second phase, let us say. I remember very well when the German invaded Belgium. Q: Yeah. Okay, well, we™ll get to that. Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 12A: Okay. Q: Had you started school by then? A: No. Q: Oh, you hadn™t? A: Because that was the -- exactly -- Q: So they didn™t start at five years old? A: No, no, no, no, I di -- the school in Belgium start when you are six - seven years old. Q: Oh, okay. A: You see, yeah, yeah. And there was no, you know, pre -- pre-school, you know, anything -- Q: Did -- did -- yeah -- did you feel Jewish ? I™m talking again before the war, did you feel Jewish? Did you know you were Jewish? A: We know that we were Jewish, but I didn™t feel that, that it was something special at that time. I think this was really an in tegrated, you know, fa -- Jewish family who respect the origin, but you -- we didn™t, you know, feel any -- Q: Be-Before the Germans invaded, had you ever heard of a man named Hitler? A: No, no. Q: You did not. A: No, no. And -- Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 13Q: So your parents never told you -- A: Nothing, and -- Q: -- the invasion, what was happening in Europe ? A: -- and this one certainly something that I™m very frustrated with. Q: Well, you were a child. A: Yeah. But it goes further, because it™s -- it™s -- i-i-if we go into the details of that, he -- especially from my mother™s side, she -- and my father, too, never real -- realized that there may be some consequence, though they should have, with the German situation, and with all the fal -- the Jewish immigra -- Q: Poland, and -- A: -- Poland , Germany, and the newsreel and the paper -- Q: Right. A: -- etcetera. I -- I will not say that I never forgive them, but I think they did a very big mistake, because the sister of my mother, and th -- and their two ch -- and the father, and the two chil-children, went into hiding, okay? And -- Q: Do you remember their names? A: Oh yes, their name. Q: Well what -- what are their names? Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 14A: When the -- one was Marie [indecipherable] they immigrated in the United States in the 50, and she died two, three years ago, and the other was Esther, who was deported with my mother in the same convoy, oh yes. Q: And her last name was? A: Lewin. Under [indecipherable]. And -- Q: And your mother™s name was? A: Melanie -- Minna, you know -- Q: Minna. A: Yeah. And -- Q: Minna Lewin? A: Lewin, yes -- Q: Yeah. A: -- and I think she was the second in ma -- first was Esther, her, and then my -- what I want to mention is that in this pre-war period, and leading to the -- the invasion from the German, I know this because after the war, that contrary to some of the friends o -- friends of the family -- Q: Mm-hm. A: -- it was my mother who resisted, you know, leaving. She -- she wanted to keep, you know, an eye on -- on her mother and father. The other didn™t care, they go -- went. She refused when my father was able to purchase, you know passport from Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 15Central American countries, who were sending their passport. And some of those families were in a camp, but in -- n-not of the same camp. The German, they -- they were in camp in -- in -- in France for -- for -- for a -- for Central American citizen were not in the war, you see? Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. A: Well, I never forgave them, to use the word, and -- and she stay and stay, contrary to my father advice, etcetera, etcetera. And this is why, an illustration of that, that is why my father send me, you know, in hiding before, because he -- he sensed that something, you know, may happen. And unf ortunately also, my grandfather became involved in a -- in a Jewish, you know, organization, inco rporated with the German, etcetera, etcetera. Q: What was the name of that -- A: Jewish -- I can -- I -- it was a -- I™m sorry for the name, but I don™t know the name. Q: Okay. A: The Jewish League, or something like that. The G-Ger -- the German recognize. Then, this period, pre -- pre-invasion also had my father think about, you know, also what may happen, and I remember that he -- the -- after the invasion in May, 1940 -- Q: Mm-hm. A: -- he brought me in the factory and showed me where he hide -- has hidden, you know, piles of money, in case something happen. Okay? Remember that. And when -- Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 16again, I don™t know when exactly, but I remember that my grandfather came and -- and ask me if he knew that my father put some money, that it will help my mother, who was in there, and I show him the money, an d I remember very well, across the street, the -- the -- the Jewish gangster who work for the German, ach -- no, is a -- Mis -- Mr. Jacques , you know, in the leather, you know, coat, and who was the one who was the denouncing all the things, etcetera. Then -- this I remember very well. Q: Let™s talk about the German invasion. A: Yeah, yeah. Q: So up to that point -- A: Yeah. Q: -- your childhood was a happy one. A: Sure. Q: And then the -- what is your memory of the German invasion? A: Yes, I -- very, very clearly again -- Q: Where were you -- A: -- in the apartment on May the -- the ninth, one day before the official -- th-the invasion. But we were living in -- close to an army barracks, okay? Q: Belgian army barracks? A: Y-Yes. Q: Mm-hm. Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 17A: And on the ninth, some German paratroo per came, and I remember very well that there were some -- some shooting from one side or the other. And we were in the apartment, I remember a sofa. We™re sitting there, and there were some friend of ma -- the family, and the next day the German invaded. Q: You heard shooting? A: Yeah. Q: What did that mean to you, as you™re seven years old? A: Nothing, nothing. Q: Doesn™t mean a -- da -- it wasn™t frightening? A: It -- no, I was not frightened, but I -- no, nothing. I didn™t know because the -- they never inf -- hinted that something may happen like that, or what. Q: But as you say, you didn™t know -- of course, again, you were very young. A: Yeah, yeah. Q: You didn™t know about the Germans invading Poland or any of that? Okay. A: N-No. Q: Okay. A: No. And -- Q: [indecipherable]. Then the next day, what happened? A: Well, the next day, the invasion came, they -- they -- they entered the countries. Then came -- Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 18Q: Okay, what was that like for you? What was your -- A: No -- Q: -- impression, what -- what are the sights, do you have any memo ries of that day? A: No, because the-the-they -- they didn™t invade, you know, Brussels -- Q: Yeah, yeah. A: -- ah, there was no fighting there -- Q: Okay. A: -- fa -- some fighting in Liege. But then came, you know, a -- a -- a situation which I still don™t rem -- I remember, but I don™t comprehend, is that people were ev -- you know, evacuating from Belgium to France , even though like in the first World War, you know, they wanted distance. I rememb er that my father was arrested in Cambrai , and I remember seeing him with hundreds of pe ople i-in the -- in the -- again, in the -- Q: Now, when was that? A: In -- in ™40, in for -- a few months after the invasion. Q: [indecipherable] a few, okay a few months. A: Yeah. Q: But let™s go back to May. A: Yeah.

Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 19A: No, n -- well, I -- I may have sensed discussions, etcetera, but I have no -- Q: Did your parents have a radio, did they listen to the radio? A: Yes, yes, but I never -- Q: You didn™t pick up on it. A: I didn™t pick up on it. The first thing about tha -- tha -- wa -- we -- there was need to -- to go evacuate, fas -- far as you can fro m the invasion. You know, hundreds of Belgian all -- not even Jewish, you know, they -- they took all the [indecipherable] and they were bombed during the wi -- th e wa -- th -- on th-th-the -- the -- the highways and everything. And we came back , and I think the document of the Belgian government say that we came back a month later. Q: Now, wh-when you say we came back, where -- when did you leave and when -- where did you go? A: We -- we leave probably in something -- I have to look in May or June -- Q: Of fo -- of ™40? A: -- you see, and then we came back to Belgium. We went to France. Q: Oh, you went to France, your family -- A: Yes, all the family went to France -- Q: -- to France.

So you came back, and then the rest of the summer -- A: The rest of the summer, and I went to school -- Q: In the fall? A: No. Summer, nothing happened , I don™t remem -- ther -- I went to school only in ™41, when I was, you know [indecipherable] Q: Oh, oh, you were eight? Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 22A: Yeah, or sev -- four -- ™41? Let me see. Yes -- Q: So you stayed home through 1940? A: Yes, yes. And I went to school -- I mentio ned in th -- I think it was ™40 then, in ™40, when I was seven. Q: Yeah. A: And then -- was in September, okay? An d in -- three months later, the German denied the Jewish children to go to school, or to serve in the army, or to serve in the -- Q: Mm-hm. A: -- public service. Then they came with the Jewish star, which I remember my mother, you know, knitting that. She was totally irresponsible, I must say. And -- and -- Q: Okay, you -- A: Yeah? Q: Tell me what it was like to have to wear the Jewish star. A: I have -- I can -- I have no -- no remembrance that it was something -- it was told that we should -- I think I have seen it in photos, that we have to wear them, and she says we have to wear them. And -- and I don™t know where I put all that -- and then I went to school for a few months, okay? Q: Okay. Was it a re -- just a regular school where -- A: Was regular school -- Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 23Q: -- mi-mixed children -- it wasn™t a Jewish school? A: No, no, it was not a Jewish [indecipherable] school. I -- and by coincidence, after the liberation I went back to the same school, and -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with David Brombart. This is tape number one, side B. Let™s just make a few corrections. A: Yeah. Q: You said you started school, the correct time was? A: September 1940. Q: ™40. Which was five months after the invasion. A: After the invasion. And I stay in school until mid-1941. Q: Okay, okay. Tell me about the school that you went to. A: Ye -- that was an elementary school. Q: A pub -- local public -- A: Local, from the -- Q: Neighborhood? A: -- th-the neighborhood of -- of Ixelles, th -- which was where we lived, and it was a -- a preparatory school also, for the -- for the second -- for col -- not for college, but Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 24for high school [indecipherable] for high school. And I remember the school and people were, and the professor were, you kn ow, concerned about the -- the Star of David at this certain time. Q: Were any of the teachers Jewish? A: This I don™t know, but I don™t think so. Q: Uh-huh. A: But, you know, when it was recreation time, etcetera, they were always discussing, you know, the situation that they were facing with the Jewish kid. There were not too many, but there were some. And -- Q: Okay, these were the teachers that [indecipherable] A: The teachers, yes. And I remember also, the teacher were discussing -- because I came -- I went back to the same school in September 40 -- 40 -- at the liberation, ™44, a-and they were still discussing that some Jewish kids came back, you see, from -- from the school. And it was not possible to distinguish the ones who care, or didn™t care, or they had the political agenda, or not. Then th-the -- all those successive decrees from the Germans says that, in mid ™41, you cannot attend school any more, etcetera. Q: Okay. Did you, as a child, sense the tension? Or were you not aware? A: I wa -- totally was innocent, you know, at that ti -- I was not aware. Q: Again, you were only seven, seven and a half. You were very young. Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 25A: I-I was -- I was not a-a-aware of -- Q: Right. A: -- of thing. I came aware when first, you know, we got to evacuate, a voluntary evacuation to -- Q: Yeah. A: -- to France . And then with tensions, you know -- Q: And di -- did -- did you talk things over with your parents? A: No. Q: Did they say anything to you, to -- A: No. Q: -- your sis -- no. A: They didn™t -- they didn™t -- they didn™t -- Q: They didn™t. They shielded you, they protected you. A: Yeah, protected me -- Q: Yeah. A: -- a-a-and -- Q: Well, you were a little boy. A: Yeah, little boy. I remember we were first hiding in -- not hiding, put in a farm, you know, outside Tournai in Belgium, where I remember my sister showing a paper, not Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 26to me, but to the -- the -- the family, the farmers there. I remember this was a few weeks before she was deported, yeah, see? Q: H-How did -- did your mother tell you that you had worn -- that you had to wear a yellow star? A: Yes, yeah. Q: And what was your reaction? A: Again, we were innocent, she said you have to wear it, and this was all part of her -- of her belief that she will not face anythi ng that, you know, the German will not do anything, you know, and things like that, you know. And this lead to what I mentioned before, that she refused my father a -- Q: Did it -- did -- A: -- a-advice to -- to -- to leave for this America, or to France, or like all many others who to -- buy those Ce ntral American passport, because he had the money to do so, and we would have escape, all of us. Q: Did it make you feel different, to wear this, from your other friends? A: Yeah, I -- I think a little, yes, yeah, yes. But th-the significance was not there. And why it will have been more of a significance if I -- I had been member some Jewish group [indecipherable] etcetera, like my sister was with Hashomer Hatzair , but I was not, I was not. No, no. Q: Yeah. So then you went to school til mid ™41? Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 27A: Yes. Q: And then they told you -- Jewish children could not go to school. A: Can not go to school. Q: And how did you feel about that? A: Not remember, no remember. Q: Okay. Okay. A: Maybe happy that I didn™t have to go to school. Q: So what did you do during the day? A: Oh, th-th-the usual, you know, playing with some friends. I remember going -- ma -- my mother put me with the scouts, the Belgium scouts, etcetera, that I like very much, and -- and -- Q: And they didn™t discriminate agai nst you being Jewish in the scouts? A: No, at that time, no. Q: No. Okay. A: No, no, because again the -- the really hard decree came in -- in ™42. Q: In ™42. A: In ™42. Q: Okay, so -- A: In ™42. Q: -- once schools were closed you just played around. Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 28A: Oh, play around [indecipherable] Q: Were you an athletic child? A: No, no, no, no, no. No. I remember we got all kinds of scouts there -- you know, events there, and some of them I didn™t like very much. Q: Did you like to read? Did you like -- A: Yes, I -- I read, yes, but again, totally absent from th-th-the contemporary situation which prevail at that time -- Q: Uh-huh. A: -- at that time. And -- Q: Do you remember your pare nts sitting around the radio, listening to your -- do you remember scenes like that? A: Yes, yes, yeah. Q: But not conveying their worst -- A: No, no, no, no. Q: Yeah. A: No. Q: Okay, and so then things started to tighten? A: Started to -- to -- to tighten very much so in -- in early ™42. Q: Okay. A: You see. Then came the -- Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 29Q: You™re still in your apartment? A: We™re still in the apartment, and then came th-the d ecree that young adults who wants to work in Germany, you know, will go, I think there is copy of those kind of forms, saying you have to take only one suitcase and things like that, you will -- your fa -- your family will not be t ouched.

A: It™s a conflicting stories, I -- I can™t ge t -- in December of ™42, they ar -- they arrested him and my mother in their apartment or, like some papers say, they only arrested her. Mm, yeah. That boat went to Malines, where the story was that he escape after he was asked to organize some -- some workshop in Malines. And other official papers say only that he was arrested in Brussels. No indication that he was in Brussel looking fo -- you know, to organize this wo rk -- led the workshop , we don™t know. The only document says that my mother was arrest ed at the apartment, okay? And that the - like they did at that time, they immediately got all th e furniture, the paintings out, you know -- Q: Your parents did? A: No, no, the German. When they arrest -- Q: Oh.

And -- and this family took him, because he had money, apparently. Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 40Q: Uh-huh. A: They were no resistance, or whatever, or friends, or -- or people who want to help. And the same happen with -- suddenly I find myself in with those miner families. Q: Mm-hm. A: A-And wh-who -- who prosper because of his money and did some very peculiar thing by themselves, but were extremely nice to me, and -- and fed me and was nothing t-to -- to be said, on the contrary , it was a -- a group of miners, but you know - Q: These are coal miners?

A: Well, that cames -- di -- you know, it™s another -- Q: It™s later on, do you mean? A: No, it wa -- it was -- it™s not a characteristic of what happened in Belgium , huh? Meanings that they knew -- Q: The family. A: A-A-And -- Q: The neighbors knew? A: They knew, an -- but nobody denounce you, you know? Contrary to -- to other family, where they denounce that you were [indecipherable] came and arrested the people. Even where m -- where my father was [indecipherable] there, you know, some family knew. And we knew that there were other Jewish family in the village there, who was very af -- all were afraid, of course, of something will happen, Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 42denunciation, or whatever. Ah, but this was a -- a -- a peculiarity, let us say, when -- a-and it™s difficult to -- to pinp oint, you know, the psychology, or the reaction to that. They knew. But I remember very well the extended miner family, and practically every evening they were all around, you know, and they talk about me, this I remember, but not [indecipherable] my name then was Verbrugen. Q: Oh, you changed your name with the miners? A: Yes. Q: What was your new name? A: Verbrugen. It™s a Belgian name. Q: Was it still David, the first one? A: No, of co -- Daniele Q: Daniele.

A: You know, as I said, I was totally [indecipherable] and I couldn't -- I -- I couldn™t comprehend really, what happened. For instance, from -- from th-the sleeping room, I remember, I watched through the window, and through the window, they -- y-you know, there was farmland etcetera, but in the background was a train station from another [indecipherable] and they were bombing it. And I don™t know even what it was, okay? There were some reaction from the police of [indecipherable] , because you know, at that time, when you cleared the -- the land for -- Q: Farming? A: -- for farming wheats, etcetera -- Q: Yeah. A: -- you know? Because people, some pe ople, you know, everybody was not hungry in -- i-in those places, but [indecipherable] wanted extra things. You were allowed to follow the machinery, you know, who pi cked them. And I was doing that, and I remember one day I said, hey [indecipherable] this thing, I took one was, you know, already, you know, assemble and [indecipherable] the thing and I carry it, but the po - Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 44- the policeman, she wa -- wa -- saw me, you know, and went to the family and said, look, now it™s very dangerous -- Q: Oh.

Then -- but I didn™t remember again, I was not -- there, the family tell me that there was an invasion, the German were losing, and Soviet Union [indecipherable] that -- etcetera. But -- Q: By that time you obviously knew about a man named Hitler. Did you have any thoughts about him, or -- A: Not about Hitler, about the German and -- Q: Just Germans in general.

Q: In Olne, yeah. A: In Olne, yeah. Q: What kind of village was that? A: It™s not a -- it was a little -- Q: Mining town? A: Mining town, you know, with -- I went to see them, there were two or three mine -- mining pits, okay? Q: Uh-huh. A: And at that time, you know, y -- yo u were this mountain of things, then [indecipherable] I remember going, and they took me to a ci-cinema once in awhile, you know? I know th -- that th ey -- as I think I mentioned, to store where they bought some furniture, you know? And it was the life at that time, they bought those furniture. Of course, never one person sit on them, no, they put plastic on it. No-Nothing, never. The m -- m -- they had the other dining room, never. Every mine town at that time, houses [indecipherable] you know, in -- outside the big cities, had the back room, you know, where there was a -- a -- a great oven, you know, and th ing, and you were sitting around it, you know. And there was always coffee there, and sugar, you know? This is where everything happens. Q: So did you feel lonely, di d you miss your family -- Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 47A: No. Q: -- did you think about your parents? A: No, no, no. I think all -- no, I had the sen timent that they didn™t do the right thing, you know, but I mean, it™s only later that I re alized that they had ample opportunity -- Q: Mm-hm -- y-yeah, yeah.

A: Though they were all baptized, but this is -- Q: Yeah. A: -- common thing like a Bar Mitzvah , it doesn™t mean anything for many people. Q: Uh-huh. A: Okay. Then -- yes. Then what I wanted to mention is that the first time I realize that there was a -- really a war, okay, was when I joined my father in May o-of ™44 -- th -- I went to school in that time. And again, ev erybody knew that I was Jewish, but they -- th-they -- they -- they protected. You know, they, of course, not a -- an issue any more on that time. End of Tape One, Side B Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 49Beginning Tape Two, Side A Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with David Brombart . This is tape number two, side A. And we were talking about your living with the miners. And you stayed with them. A: Stayed with them. Q: That was the last -- was that the last family you were [indecipherable] A: No, a -- th-the last one was when I went to visit, for the first time, my father. Q: When was that? A: That was in -- in May of ™44 -- of ™44. Q: Okay, so up to that time you had stayed -- A: With th-the -- the miner™s family. Q: With the miner™s family. A: And was a -- mention was a very good wi th me, and you know, took some chances, you know, in th -- in going to -- to -- to movies, going out, etcetera, and some -- I had the sense that there was a German prob -- iissue. For instance, I remember very well in front of a [indecipherable] which a -- in the city in Belgium close to Olne, there was, in front of the train station, I was going somewhere with th em -- I remember well that there was a German, or -- or a Belgian SS officer in black, you know, and I knew that I should not be close to him, okay? Then when he -- he turned right and turned left. You know, I was circling around, i-if he notice or not. At that time I think they -- Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 50they knew that everything was lost a-and they didn™t pay some attention. I will tell you more about the nu -- another illustration of that. Then I went to school, or at least attended some classes where my father was hidden. Again, I think th-the teacher was -- you know, at that time it was one teacher for -- for a big class, you know, I mean so many pe -- and it was a little place, and -- and I realized something very important arrive -- it was in June ™44, and he didn™t tell us that th e invasion arrive, but he -- Q: This is the Normandy invasion, right? A: Yeah. Q: Yeah. A: And he didn™t -- but he didn™t -- he teach us a song, which is -- it was called, ﬁMy Lovely Normandy.ﬂ You know, and then -- Q: Can you sing a little bit of it? Why don™t you sing a little? A: I don™t know si -- no, I-I -- I -- I have to be -- think about that. Normandy , my love, or my tera -- my city, or something like that. A place that I will always return, or something like that, I rememb er. Then I went to my father, I said something was happen in Normandy , you know? And he said, yes, the invasion, because he had the radio. During all this time, in that place, h-he -- he di -- ik -- he never went out for -- for years. Q: But what town was he in? A: Jistu, in Jistu. Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 51Q: He was in Jistu? A: Yeah, he was Jistu, yes. Q: Okay. A: This is a place where I visit him in May or something -- Q: ™44. A: -- ™44. Q: So that was the first time you saw him since you left? A: Since I left, yes. Q: What was it like when you first saw him? A: Oh, he was very pleased, of course he was so pleased, and -- Q: How did he look? Wh at was his health like? A: His health at that time was, I think, still okay. But after, he developed some heart problem. [indecipherable] . And he never went out from that house, so it was in -- in a [indecipherable] and he was exercising only in an attic, you know? Q: How long was he hidden? A: Oh, from -- from ™42 til ™44, you know. Q: In the same? A: No in the same, no. At first he went in Brussels, but with the same family. When he escape, or etcetera, he went with that family, did it for money, but that™s all right, and then took him to this place in Jistu, you know. Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 52Q: Jistu. And he stayed in their -- A: There. Q: -- house. A: Yeah, a little farmhouse, I remember, and -- Q: Did he go out at night? A: No, never. And he just was in this attic, you know. Q: So no one knew he was there? A: No. Q: They were afraid to tell the neighbors. A: No one know he was there except one and twice that the farmer says, you know, there is somebody there. And the -- the wife -- the -- the wife said it™s my brother visiting, or something, you know? And -- and he was in an attic, and he was circling in this attic all the time, I still remember trace of his path, you know? And he was counting some coins, you know, to do something. And -- sorry -- and -- a-and I think he went outside once or twice, because ther e was no, at that time, bathroom in the house, so of course you have to go outsid e. And -- and then came , obviously, after the Normandy invasion and -- and we saw hundreds of American plane -- or planes coming in, you know, and we couldn™t underst and what they were dropping, all those aluminum things, you know, that were to escape the [indecipherable] system or things like that. And -- Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 53Q: Now, wha -- A: Yeah? Q: -- did you just visit your father -- A: No. Q: -- or did you stay with him? A: I -- I could not return, because of the bombing, y-you know? Q: You -- you -- you came in-initially just to visit him. A: Just to visit him, and then I was unable to go back to Olne -- Q: Back to where you were hiding -- A: -- because the bridge -- yes, right. Q: So you stayed with your father in the farm house? A: Yes. Q: Up in the attic? A: No, no, no, no. I was -- no, they couldn™t stop me. I was able to -- to -- to move around, to move around. Q: Okay. A: All around. And as I mentioned, I atte nd some of the classes in June of ™44. Q: So you™d -- okay, so you lived in the farmhouse. A: Yes, with my father, until the liberation in September ™44. Q: Okay. Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 54A: Yeah. Q: Yeah. A: Yeah. And he also -- Q: Wh-When you went to visit him -- A: Yeah? Q: -- did you know you were going to stay with him, or you A: Oh no, of course not. Q: You thought you were just going to visit for the day or something? A: Sure, sure, yeah. Sure -- no -- yeah. No, th-the plan was to -- Q: To go back. A: -- back, at least you -- and in like -- probably didn™t like the idea for me to be with him if something happen, of course. Q: So that™s when you went to the school in Jistu. A: For -- in Jistu, and in June, you know, there was this -- this in -- the invasion -- Q: Right. A: -- and the teacher mention, etcetera. Then thing became more clearer in term of -- of the invasion, the in -- the American and British are coming, etcetera. And my father was -- he devised something which I think ma ny Jewish family did with their naiveté or their idiocy or whatever. He -- he hided in a -- he had a -- a -- there was a big armoire, you know? Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 55Q: Mm-hm. A: And then he had the straw that you can close the door from the inside, outs -- yeah, the inside, so that if everybody went -- Q: He had to hide. A: -- he will hide, like when the German or the Belgium police came, they knew the tricks, of course. It will -- I mean. absolutely nothing, but he did that, you know? But then, i-in -- in August, September, the -- th-the -- the -- the German became to -- to -- to return to Germany, you know? And I remember they stop in the village, you know, but they were already disorganized. I remember a German youth smoking a pipe on -- on the head of the cars, you know, they were [indecipherable] . But there was a German officer, I have to find out -- he had the yellow uniform, maybe from a tank is still something, and people were obliged to feed him, you know, when he co -- he came in the house, I could not [indecipherable], then I went in the dining room, and I don™t know what his reaction was, did he know, or did he say the hell with it, you know, ah, we -- we don™t do that any more, or didn™t want to do it, he was not an SS, I have no idea. And they departed. Okay? Then , I remember very well the incident with the German tanks, three or four, passing in the -- you know, we can see the -- in the village. I remember also that the -- the ally bomb some of the roads. And as you know, the German escape with everything they wi -- they had, and with horses and things like that.

But then I visited my grandfather maybe once or twice, I didn™t want to go there. There was all this thing in my head, but -- that I could not really express, you know, in deta ils, and I had a reaction to that. You know, I didn™t want anything to do with them, or things like that. I kept relation with this other sister who finally immigrate to United States. Q: Mm-hm.

A: A-And I began to a -- to -- to say well -- to -- to understand that when they were passing through, there was no danger. It when -- it -- th-the -- the noise stop, then there was dane -- Q: The noise stop -- A: You see, and this I registered very well, because I went to school, I went ha -- walking, and I saw them, I say well, okay, fine. Q: Uh-huh. A: It™s -- was somebody else, or another city, in Antwerp, because their aim, like in the Battle of the Bulge was to -- to -- to stop any -- any landing of material and goods Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 61in Antwerp, of course, like that, yes. Then I went back, as I mentioned before, to the same school, and it has been a hell of -- of -- for me to -- to catch up, because I didn™t go to school -- Q: Okay you™re now -- you™re -- it™s the end of the war for you -- A: Yeah. Q: And you are -- you go back to where, to Brussels? A: To Brussels , in September. Q: In September. A: And I -- Q: Of -- A: Of ™44. Q: -- ™44.

Well, it was a huge place, that [indecipherable] and -- and -- and funny enough, the Belgium archive have no notice of that, nothing. But the police [indecipherable] had that he return, that his address was this. Q: That y-you and your father returned there? A: Yeah. Q: Yeah. A: And I went to s -- Q: And it was not damaged or anything? A: No, no, no, it was a -- no. Q: Okay. A: It was a -- they did -- the German did an office building of it, and I remember -- Q: The Germans had used it? A: Used it. Q: As their office building? A: As one of the office building, but not -- I don™t know the timing, but not for very long when we came back. Q: Okay. A: Okay, it was not [indecipherable]. What I remember is was plenty of desk and everything, and I remember in the base ment where my father found some guns, Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 63etcetera. And like stupidly, he -- he -- he gave them back to the poli -- Belgium police, a-and things like that. Yeah. And I went to school, and then it has been a very difficult period for me to catch up, b ecause I didn™t go to school. Q: You™re now 11 years old. A: 11 years old, didn™t go to school. Q: Did you feel -- did you feel very old? A: No. Q: You didn™t? A: No. Q: After all that you had lived, yo u™d lived without your parents -- A: No, no, because immediately it was back to the -- th-the -- this af -- more or less affluent life, you know, with my father, who pu -- Q: But you didn™t have a typical childhood, obviously, and so -- A: Oh, u-under -- I forgot, you know -- Q: -- did you feel older than some of the other children -- A: No. Q: -- because you™d been in hiding? A: No, no, no. Q: So who were the other ch ildren in the classes when you went back? Were there Jewish children? Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 64A: No, of course not. It was in the same pub lic school that I went to in ™41, okay? And th-there may be some Jewish, but I don™t remember that. Q: You don™t remember talking about what they -- what they went through during the war, that™s [indecipherable] A: No, no, no, no, a -- a -- yes, I -- I -- not in that school, okay? Q: Okay. A: All right? That -- it was difficult time. I had to -- to -- to learn the grammar, to write, it was a disaster. My father pay for some extra courses at home, and things like that. Q: This is all in French, of course. A: Oh -- oh yes, that was all in French. And -- and piece of [indecipherable] I realize what happened with my mother [indecipherable] but not the intensity of it, or th-the murder, or the assassination, the arrest. And I began to -- to -- to get back to the same ki -- guys I was friendly when -- before the war, who -- who had been put in cemetery, cemetery with nuns. Q: Oh. A: And he was a -- th-they wanted to make a priest out of him. Q: I-In a convent, you mean? A: Yeah, convent or something like that. Q: Mm-hm. Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 65A: And yes, and then we ta lk about the -- the -- the -- Q: What you went through? A: -- went through, and what he went thro ugh and -- and this was the beginning of a -- of a new chapter where I begin to -- to be interested in politics an-and labor unions, you know? Because a-again a reaction to -- to what happened before, okay? And we became active in some organizations, okay? And -- and this was the period from ™44 til ™49. Was still, you know, discussion and then I became active in the political movement, you know. Q: Okay, but for -- we-we™ll get to that. A: Yeah. Q: Tell me about the end of the war, what was that like for you? A: Oh, it wa -- Q: -- and liberation -- A: Yes, it was a [indecipherable] and everybody was happy. People who were like my -- my aunt came back to Brussels , you know. We were to [indecipherable] and the people who were in a camp in Switzerland came back, and they went -- the ones who were in the ca -- escaped to Switzerland . They were -- they were in Kerbene, France for all the [indecipherable] came back. We had a lot of memories, and I remember the discussion then was the situation in Israel, and you know, the -- the -- the independence [indecipherable] Israel and this I remember all that. Some were Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 66member of the [indecipherable] who wanted the greater Israel, and the [indecipherable] and so on and so forth. I remember that we were, of course, concerned [indecipherable] the Egyptians were 15 miles from Tel Aviv . Of course, there it doesn™t count, everything is so close. We -- and this I remember, and a son from one of my father brothers in Poland also immigrated in Belgium , okay? And he became a famous radiolog, one of the top, you know, doctors in radiology, okay? Write a thousand of book. If you look on the web, you will see his books all over, all over the place. But then came the story that because he was a doctor, he -- he went -- he was asked to join the UN observer in Palestine, you know, during the beginning of the war. And do you know that he took me with him, you know, and I knew that my uncle was there, etcetera. I didn™t -- still don™t understood, but it was very fun -- Q: Are we talking about the 1948? A: Yes. Q: You™re talking about the 1948 War of Independence? A: Yeah, yeah, War of Independence. He was the UN observer. Q: And he took you and you were 15? A: 15, o-or what. And it was a trip in the plane, in the army plane and then all that. And then I began also to -- t-to -- to -- to learn th -- about what was the politics, you know, I -- I began to sense, beca -- Q: Right now you™re in high school? Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 67A: Oh yes, I was in the high school, okay? And -- but it was ™48 like you -- you mention, and I learned more about the events with Palestine, the creation of the state, about the Egyptian, etcetera, and about international politics. Because m-my uncle was in the UN observer, never observe anything. We were always in the beach in Tel Aviv, you know? And when the -- the -- the -- th e -- the -- some other people in the UN says, you know, you have to go and observe the Jewish are doi ng things like that, they went in another direction. You know, when the -- when the -- th-the [indecipherable] you have to say what they did. Nothing. And you know, we landed in -- not in Tel Aviv , there was no airport, but in Haifa , you know, in the little place of that, and it was fun, except that I took the events seriously, beginning to -- to understand and there -- what was going on. And -- and met some -- my uncle was there, you know, and other member of the family, you -- a-a-and I forgot to mention who I met in Belgium after the liberation. They were in the -- in the Jewish brigade. Q: I see. A: You see? And the Jew -- I remember the Jewish brigade when th-the -- the allies told the officer of the Jewish brigade, you know, it™s enough, you are killing enough German, you have to be done [indecipherable] any more over there in Germany, in the occupation. Then th ey came to rest in Belgium. I remember walking very calmly with one of my uncle was the Jewish brigade, etcetera [indecipherable] which I met later, he was in the army, he was in the army paper all the time, and -- and of course Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 68they departed. And the -- of course explaining that we don™t care about the British, we don™t care about anybody. Want to learn -- want to -- to use the arms, you know, with [indecipherable] as you know in the history in Lebanon th -- and things like that [indecipherable] that was the bi -- the main group , a thousand of them. Okay, then I met them again, anything. And my fath er joined me at that time also -- Q: He came over from Belgium? A: -- from Belgium in ™48, and that was my first trip. Q: How long were you there for? A: I think three weeks only, because nobody care about this UN business anyway. The same today. [laughter]. Same. It was already clear at that time. Q: When you said your Uncle Lukt -- A: Yeah? Q: -- was supposed to go and observe -- A: Yeah, yeah. Q: -- instead he went to the beach, did he purposely not want to observe, or he just wanted to go to the beach? A: No, no, he -- he was one of the -- the many who realized this was a futile exercise, that both the Israeli, the Israeli, we were there, didn™t want them -- Q: Yeah. A: -- to observe anything. Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 69Q: So he purposely went to the beach? A: Yes, like with the other officer -- and -- and -- and after awhile -- I don™t know the details, but I presume the UN says, you know, this is enough [indecipherable] think they won this thing, and you know, there is no point, because there were things that the Jewish did because they had to do it at that time with the arms and things like that. And were not very, you know, acceptable in -- in quotation, but there was nothing else to do, huh? And that™s was it. And -- Q: So you came back to Brussels? A: I came back to Brussels and -- Q: Went to -- back to high school. A: Went to high school, and explained the kind of high school, it was a [indecipherable] then the -- the socialist party who -- in Belgium high school, you know, where they train people at that time for the different movement in the sort of -- the co-ops movement, cooperative movement . Of course, does not exist any more, it™s -- that thing -- for the health service, because until today the health service is run by political party in Belgium , and [indecipherable] then you are to go in a socialist health plan or Catholic health plan. And there a story with that too. My wife was a very conservative [indecipherable] and didn™t want -- not practi -- religious for [indecipherable] but still today says something against the -- the socialist movement. Anyway, the fa -- my son Eric was born in the socialist hospital. And then she say, n Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 70never again, [indecipherable]. Then [indecipherable] my daughter , Sarah, she went to the red -- Red Cross hospital. Then the th ird one was the political -- you know, strict political party and the other were the -- th-the humanitarian and things like that. End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with David Brombart. This is tape number two, side B. You were talking about your experiences in high school, you had come back from Israel, and then you went and you were talking about the health care system. A: Yeah, well, in -- yeah. Q: Okay. So you finished high school, or -- A: No. Q: Or what was your high school experience? A: Well, after the liberation I went to the first years of high school. Q: Mm-hm. A: Okay. And then because I began to be influenced by politics and [indecipherable] I -- I went to the socialist training center school, okay? With, a-at that time a boarding school, but I didn™t go to -- because it was in Brussels, I didn™t go to the boarding school, and this was an institution delivering a diploma in social work, okay? Again, see, in Belgium you are th -- e-even in 1907, a public school, and a Catholic school Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 71system, okay? And the third one is the state™ s system, okay? And for instance, my wife went to the state social training school, okay? And at that time, th-th-th-th-the -- the social worker™s profession was not -- was not recognized as a -- as a university, you know, school. It™s only later, now, that it -- it deliver Master, before it was only Bachelor. And because I was so involve in this politics that I didn™t even finish th-the -- the -- the -- the course. They say, you don™t need it, go immediately into you know, the -- the socialist movement, okay? And we w ill take you as the leader of the socialist youth. When we say socialist, I have to ex plain this again to some of our American friend. socialist, in the United State has a communist meaning. Of course, this was not the case, this is social democrats. Like, for the election of the last few days in France, when they call a socialist, he is not more socialist than I am, but it -- it -- it is to be understood on the basis -- then I-I -- I went to work for them, but before that, when I was 19 years old -- Q: This is 1952? A: Yes. I was drafted in the army, because in Belgium in th -- it was compulsory, okay? Then, you know -- Q: Let -- let -- let™s back up -- A: -- yeah, yeah. Q: -- let™s back up -- A: Yeah, yeah. Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 72Q: -- a little bit. 1952. A: Yeah. Q: T-Talk -- yo-you did talk about your Bar Mitzvah a little bit -- A: Yes. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah -- Q: -- but -- but -- but let™s talk a little bit more about it, cause this -- A: Bar Mitzvah -- Q: -- would be 1946. A: Yes. Q: So -- A: Bar Mitzvah -- Q: -- you said you had three days of celebration, but what were your thoughts? Did you feel more Jewish after what you had been through, because -- A: No. No. I -- Q: -- you had to be hidden because you were a Jew? A: -- no, I -- I knew for me it was something linked with the heritage. Something that you cannot -- like my other -- like this doctor tried to -- he said to divorce himself from, you know, the Jewish identity, okay? I know that I was Jewish because we had the -- my friend was Jew -- friend of my father was Jewish. We came to -- to be a -- a member of the Maccabee in -- in Brussels. Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 73Q: But weren™t you angry that because you were Jewish you had to go through what you went through -- A: No, no -- Q: -- and you lost your [indecipherable] A: No, well, you know, I -- Q: There was no feelings of anger. A: -- there is no -- no feeling of -- no, it was more the feeling of the stupidity of the entire situation, you know, because of the -- as I tried to mention, if I had anything to say, we were -- we were -- we would have left Belgium even before the invasion, you know, like many did. And it is an accident o f, and a tragedy of the Jewish people in history that one -- two brothers came to Belgium, the other went to -- to -- to -- to U.S., and -- and the other ones were -- went to Israel. Then it™s more of that kind of things, because in this political action, there was never a ny sign of anti-Semitism, any sign of you are Jewish, or not. This neve r, never, never happen. It may have happened here, in the United States, but not -- and so -- Q: But when you -- but for you, in growing up, you had no anti-Semitism -- A: No, no, no, no. When I went to the army -- you know, when you ask in the army, I want to go there, they just do the opposite, you see? A-And -- and -- and -- and I -- I ended up in the Air Force near a -- we were the few planes that Belgium had, you know? And -- but it was very important in my, let™s say, development. Hu -- I became Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 74totally independent, I didn™t want to hear about my father saying you have to take th -- over the business, or whatever. All this was something else. Okay, I become an activist and -- and -- and developed th is whole campaign that no Belgium conscript, draftees, can be sent to Korea -- it was the time of the Korean war. Q: Korean war. A: And I say, you know, send the volunteers , but we have nothing -- you know, we were all in favor of facing the Chinese and all that, but we didn™t want drafting to come. No, i-it is a bit like here, when they decide no draft a ny more, volunteer. And certainly when later on [indecipherable] the campaign against sending Belgium to -- in the Congo , was the same thing. I say, you ca n send anything you want, except the draftees, you see. And of course, now there is no more draft, then this was a -- a good idea to advance at tha -- on that time. And the army was a lot of fun again [indecipherable] because it was a comedy, you kn ow. When I finished th-the instructions, you know. And of course when we were French speaking, they were sending you in the Flemish speaking, you know, training. I -- nobody could understand. I -- Q: Did you know any Flemish? A: Yes, because in Brussels you had to learn in school Flemish, and [indecipherable] still bilingual today, you know? [indecipherable] I could. And I remember one or two questions from officers, but are you really Belgian? Because you know, at that time Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 75you can see [indecipherable] I didn™t look when I was young, like I look now. I became more, you know, tan and [indecipherable] . Then I say, what do you think? If not, I will not be here, and things like that. They never said Jewish or anything, you know. That I use for the first time during my military servic e, my Jewish origin, you know? And this is -- Q: In what sense? A: In the sense that I-I knew somebody who said, you kn ow, the Jewish holidays are coming, you know? Go to the commandant a nd say you are Jewish, I want to attend. He says, you™re crazy, because I was already before active in the socialist movement. I said, no, no, no, no. You don™t go to the syna gogue. I say, here, the letter. I knew the -- the cantor, who was -- who -- oh, my father, you know, as -- a -- a something -- a [indecipherable] -- I don™t know the word. Oh my father, the fact that he became one of the -- in the army, the -- the religious om -- officer [indecipherable] Q: The chaplain. A: The chaplain. And he went to my father and say, look, I want to be this chaplain, I n -- I need a letter from you saying that I spea k Flemish. If not, I will not get the job. Then my father say, you know, you™ve -- good, very good friend, you™re Flemish. And then he™s the one who says, you know, you™re the Flemish. Then, it was really crazy because it was the training camp, it was September, you know, I went in August. I was with a girlfriend in France, in holiday, my father say look, you have to go. I say okay. Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 76And -- and -- and I went to the commandant, he sa -- gave me a week, you know? And said at that time we were trying to -- to train for a parade, where we were giving, you know, a blind man a -- a -- a dog, you know. And then they say you cannot do that, you will not be there. You know, you have to stay and watch all the -- th-the -- the guns, you know, make -- it was a comedy. Of course, when I ca -- went back, they got me, but in turn that I was every day on -- on duty. And -- and I say yeah. Anyway, that™s a -- a -- a [indecipherable]. It was a comedy because the commandant of the Brussels airport, you know guards, we were gua rds, so-called special unit to guard the airport, introduce -- I introduced myself. They say Brombart, Brombart. He got i-in his book and he find oh, that his mistress asked to watch for a Brombart, in case you have a Brombart treat him well. So funny, huh? Q: How di -- A: Yeah? Q: What was the connection? A: Well, he had mistress who knew probably my father. Q: Oh. A: Maybe she was also his mistress, I have no idea. [indecipherable]. He say okay fine, you will -- you will serve in my office, he was the -- the -- the food thing. I had to check the balance of every can of champagne for the officer, etcetera. I had many visits from the inspector, you know, if the -- the [indecipherable] but for me it was Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 77nothing, I-I knew five bottles less, two, etcetera. And na-na -- I learn all the tricks. Keeping the coupon from the chocolates, you know. And the officer guy came and say I want five bottle of wine, and -- and I gave -- I put, you get fi -- you got five, fine. But only -- he got only three, I got the two other. And it was a comedy. And I was immediately assigned to be in the educatio n offices, and I run the -- the information center on the thing, and I remember when my biggest audience and people in was when Stalin died in ™53, and that was someth ing. He was still believed to be somebody, and they came. And we were -- we were not eating in the mess, we were eating in the kitchen, you know? It was a [indecipherable]. And at the end they say, you know, [indecipherable] just get out of our way and they gave me the living out pass. Then every night I was at home, have to go back in the morning. Was really a comedy. And -- and a -- I was supposed to serve 24 -- Q: Months? A: -- 24 months -- Q: Months. A: -- because of the Korean war. Q: Uh-huh. A: And I serve only -- it was 18. Q: Uh-huh. Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 78A: And then it was 12, and then there was nothing left. So, very good. And because I am now a so-called Korean veteran, I got an other 500 dollars a year. It™s crazy -- it™s crazy, I say, what do you think? Then they say, you have this -- this free a -- free health service, and free on the train, I say, oh, now I have another train [indecipherable] free three times a day, or -- or anyway, that™s the whole [indecipherable] on the thing. But anyway -- Q: Then you left the army. A: And then immediately -- Q: And then what did you do? A: I immediately was as -- asked by the party to serve as in the -- as head of the social democratic youth. Q: Youth, uh-huh. A: Yeah, mm-hm. Q: So you stayed in Brussels? A: Oh yeah, stay in Brussels and -- Q: For how long? A: Oh, til ™58. Q: Oh, okay. A: ™58. Q: Mm-hm. Living with your father? Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 79A: Living with Father, more or less, yes. Q: Uh-huh. A: And -- and at that time it was not the same man any more. I-I-I-Is -- Q: Was he bitter about what happened? A: No, but he lost his business, more or less. Then he had some real difficulties. Q: Did he talk about your mother at all?

You know, I -- I knew about Normandy, I knew about -- you know, th-th-th-the -- the German invasion, about the moving to France for awhile, about my sister, you know, suddenly leaving. You know, bor -- being deported, a-and thin gs of that kind, but -- Q: Do you think about those years often now? A: No -- yes, but not -- that™s very new [indecipherable] only since I am retired, and that communication came because I -- on -- on [indecipherable] etcetera on the internet, they asking about my daughter, who was until now working for a f -- a German foundation in Germany, and they say, are you this, are you the father, or -- the daughter of this, or that or that. And th-the story with -- with Germany, because of the international thing, I have -- I unders tood that the German people were not the Nazi, etcetera, though they can be blamed for [indecipherable]. And when she graduate from Boston, through my contact, I knew that they were looking for Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 105somebody at the German foundations, the socialist one, you know, in -- in Brussels, and then she immediately got the job, you see? And until today -- and I™ll tell you in a minute, she™s still the non-German, the only non-German girl in the -- in that foundation. And they paid for a master at the London school of economy. They paid for -- I don™t know how many times, for a - a German, you know, schooling. And she spent for them seven years in Latin America, you know, until she was brought back to the headquarters in Bond, okay? And now she™s in two ye ars maternal leave, living just on -- in a -- in a house there. And I don™t think she will go back, but that™s another story. She wa -- she like to stay in the U.S. , and to be close to her mother, and -- Q: Yeah. A: -- find something else. Q: Yeah. A: Yeah, then -- Q: What about your son? A: Your s -- my son? After Amherst, you know, went to medical school in Belgium. Q: In Belgium . A: Yeah. And he was in the second year when he had cancer of the thyroids, you know? Q: Ooh. Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 106A: And then he had to stop that . Then he -- he worked 10 years in public health in the [indecipherable] in Brussels. Moved from one job to the othe r, but the situation is not good, as far as health. Arthritis and all kind of complication. Then that™s it. That™s it. Q: How were your children raised? Were they raised as Catholic? A: No, no. Q: Or as Jews, or -- A: No, nothing, nothing. Q: Nothing. A: This was not an issue. Q: Mm-hm. A: Though they know perfectly well that I wa -- I™m Jewish , and my mother was a po - a Catholic, she was Catholic. And the only thing, we took them once in a synagogue, once in a -- in -- in a church. And -- and I didn™t influence them in -- in any theory, or any thing. They said, do you believe in someth ing, I say yes, but I don™t really believe in anything. Then came the word -- the word that I didn™t know exist [indecipherable] Q: Fantastic, mm-hm. A: -- it™s all gimmicks, you know. You know, either you believe, or [indecipherable] . You can say like [indecipherable] I believe in something, or creation, etcetera. I -- I always remember them when I was under the -- in front of the [indecipherable] guys when we are ta -- teaching, you know. One of the first thing they say, the philosophy Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 107was you know, to put an apple on the table. And they say -- they told you about God, about this and that, all this [indecipherable]. Look at this apple. In a few days you will see insect [indecipherable] coming from the apple. Huh? [indecipherable] came from -- we don™t know the answer, from the universe, and -- and these -- and you see now where they -- at that time they say [indecipherable] or we™ve got natural catastrophe, you know, you co -- you believe what happen in the old time. We have the islands forming, the volcanoes and the belie f we -- in God, or in the sun, etcetera [indecipherable] people who were not -- they have la -- then they say look, then -- we answer the -- you know. There are many differe nt apples, you know. And so -- actually not. [indecipherable] this one you just [indecipherable] and that™s it, yeah, yeah. No, it™s a -- no, it™s the -- you know, in the -- when I was retired, came this thing with the Belgium, you know, amnesty here and say you can get the [indecipherable] you can think this because then union from the job. And -- and then came this bulletin from the Diaspora, you know, you see. This is a bulletin which is written by a group of progressive Jews in -- in Belgium , were -- who are trying to -- to have the Belgium state recognized, their capability during the war, which has not done, contrary let™s say to -- to France. And who introduced through politicians, some legislation on that, but until now, even under social democrat government they don™t move. They have ceremonies, etcetera in Malines, or in other places where there is Jewish past history, but they don™t recognize the culpability of the state, saying that most of the arrest, Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 108etcetera were done by Belgium policemen and gendarmes. You know, they -- the German were not to be seen too much, but for the Jewish case was this guy named [indecipherable] and many collaborators, you know ? The German was using them until a certain point, you know, when, in ™43 they were losing the war, and then they -- they had to -- to compli -- dominate every sector of the population and against the resistance, which was so and so, so and so because after the war, practically everybody was a resister. And -- and things like that. Then -- then that was the -- the case, and it™s only now that they came with this, they ca -- lik e they came to me with these veteran question. I never ask anything, you know, th ey say you -- you are Korean veteran, you are a-allowed to get this 500 euro, 700 dollar for this, and [indecipherable] for that. And then they came with the restituti -- [indecipherable] then this group, who was [indecipherable] try also to fight anti-Semitism in Belgium, which you know is rising like many place in Europe. Not through violent acts, but through, you know, speeches by the extremist right and things like that. And also they are attacking the -- the -- the Belgium government to av -- agree that all the funds from the restitution be divided between the survivors or the son of the survivors, and -- and given to the creation of a Jewish foundation of things like that. And I became interest because I -- I think, learning what happened here with the claims, with Eisennstadt and with Eggenberger, th-that it™s not acceptable. That the priorities should not be there hundred and hundred of thousand of salaries th at they get. Ah, but we were -- we -- the Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 109-- th-the survivor, and I s -- I ready to say I don™t need it, but there are some people who need it, okay? And -- and -- and then this is quite important. Then bu -- they also -- other news about this Belgian archive. Th en I wrote to the guy, he was a -- he was Jewish, [indecipherable] and -- who send me all those photo and reports and things like that, which I think is -- is quite important because there were so many, and answer indirectly your question, I was not brief on when they came, what was their history. You know, anyone is that, and what™s -- what happened exactly with my brother, my father-in-law, with my mother™s resistance to all that, I -- wha -- wha -- what is the truth was not the truth, you know, in this thing. Then it was very important. And this led me to -- to ask about this interview. You see, this is the chronology of the thing. And Arnheim said yes, it™s very important that there is a second step, that all documentation is in fact, used, in a way that you have nothing extr aordinary to tell, a-and I -- I know that. It™s just one experience, okay, and it™s not the same experience that the -- th-the -- my father was really hidden in the house, couldn't go out , okay? There were some children also in the same situation. A nd children were denounced by people and send into camp. O-Or my friends sent in a convent or a monastery. Then the situation is very, very, very different. But -- but st -- End of Tape Three, Side A Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 110Beginning Tape Three, Side B Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with David Brombart. This is tape number three, side B. Do you feel that you lost your childhood since you were away from your family for so many years? A: No. I don™t have this feeling. I think, as I tried to explain, the early childhood was so gratifying, the memories are all good. A little travel to Holland, I photo -- visited the tulip plants, you know, and I -- Q: This is pre-war, with your family? A: Pre-war, family -- Q: With your family. A: -- and then it was so -- you see the picture of the seaside, that I show you. This all good memories. Q: But you were still quite you ng when you had to be hidden. A: Yeah, I was quite young, oh bo -- yes, and -- but I remember that the spirit was good. Q: Mm-hm. A: Good in term of -- of family life, of -- as I mentioned, travel and gifts, when they were going out and th e arrival of -- of Sarah from Poland etcetera. You see how close, or immediately she develop well, and it was so [indecipherable] . And -- okay, Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 111and th-the war year were some kind of an interruption. Because afterwards, I was again spoil like hell from my father and traveling and -- and very close, Didn™t want him to marry or something -- I didn™t say that, etcetera. Traveling all the time. Absolutely no -- no -- no problem. Bar Mitzvah and -- and -- Q: Did you feel very Jewish at your Bar Mitzvah ? A: Oh no, no, no. They tried to tell me all kinds of -- of ne -- knowledge, you see, and I did learn the Hebrew, I could recite, becau se there was some school you had to go to in the summer. To the synagogue school -- Q: You went to a -- you went a -- a Hebrew school, a synagogue school? A: Went for the synagogue -- Q: Yeah. A: -- just for the Bar Mitzvah, huh? Q: Just for the -- A: Yeah, yeah, for -- yeah. E-Everybody who had the Bar Mitzvah had to go through that school. Q: Yeah. A: For the Hebrew knowledge. All this was good, but I -- I was not interested. Then I didn™t know what was happening, huh? Th en my father, with his three days of ceremony and all that, gifts and gifts, and peop le who came even stole some things out of my [indecipherable]. A-A-And -- and -- no -- and -- no, I told you th -- the only Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 112time I feel Jewish, when I was asking to get out for a week from the army. And that -- a-a-and that was quite important, but afterwar ds really, I was not view like that, okay? Even not in my work in the Arab countr ies, you know, because of my appearance, I could go anywhere I want in the Arab country, they take me for an Arab. Q: Mm-hm. A: When I went -- I remember very well in Tunis once, i-in front of the hotel there was some kind of a incident, I don™t know what, but anyway, I was looking what™s -- may have happen, you see? Then the older man began to -- to scream at me in Arabic, and I said, but I don™t speak Arabic. You see, all those young people, Tunisians, you know, speak some French now, you know, sh -- speak Arabic, etcetera. I say okay. May -- ma-many speeches are everywhere in the Arab country, but it was always in French of cour -- of course, huh? Now, the question would be very different, because of the Islamic influence. You know, who penetr ates every fiber of -- of society in those places, will be difference, very different. We would not have been welcomed like I was [indecipherable] you know, a defender of the liberty and independence and they o -- they ask -- we were in [indecipherable] to -- to -- for so many things, including shipment of f-food, under -- you kn ow, the p -- I think it was called PL40 program of the United States to send food abroad, all this or that. Immediately once one of their people were arrested, we were going there, we freed them, you know, etcetera. No, no, no, no -- that™s not possibl e any more. Not possible. Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 113Q: When you -- you -- you talked about the rise of this militant Islam. A: Yeah, yeah. Q: How do you react to that, considering the fact that your life, your childhood was changed by the rise of some -- you know, a dictator that -- A: Yeah. Well -- Q: -- deprived people of their civil rights A: Yeah, yeah, sure. Q: Do you feel more of a connection, cause he -- you had more direct effects from that? A: Ah, yes, and you know, it™s the general knowledge of the danger of authoritarianism and dictatorship and th e rise of it and the fact that in Europe, twice the United States had to come to rescue them, that they did it. It™s a -- it™s a -- it™s a -- i-it™s a -- a continent who has been so much involved in internal struggles, going back to Napoleon and etcetera, and the same mistake to try to i -- to rule in the su -- these large territories of the Soviet Unions . In -- in that sense we saw some parallel with the Islam, the raise of Islam. Q: But my point is, do you ha ve more of a visceral reaction? Do you know what I mean? A: Yes. Q: More emotional, because your life was changed by it? Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 114A: Yes. Q: By that. A: Yeah, yes and no, it™s more on the political level again, because I was in charge of a program called -- the first program called Islam against the Islamists, to make the difference between the two, you see, and -- and -- and again, there™s nothing religious, it is a group of power monsters, who will do anything to access to the control of a state, uh-huh, and the -- in the Koran, everybody knows that i-i-it™s -- it™s like the Catholicism, a-and -- and the other form, built on the -- o-on an evolution, which -- which show only that with the raise of Islam, we see that they are as primitive like the Catholics were hundreds of years ago, of the Jewish, etcetera. Then this is more on that kind of level, and the fact that this has to be -- has to be stopped because there are new factors, okay, meaning -- especially in western Europe, with the immigration from our country. We have the problem here, we have another, the Latin American immigration, etcetera, who is different, of course, from the Jewish immigration, or the Belg -- the Belgium. I found in the paper so many story where Belgium descendent, even this -- to make a joke, this D.C. Madame, you know, etcetera, she is born in -- in a place in Pennsylvania called Charleroi, who is a -- a name of a city, mean you find, more or less, and in the [indecipherable] you find, you know, that™s moving, when they say, he was in the Battle of the Bulge, you see, or before a -- y -- many, many, many things Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 115when -- went to that [indecipherable] it™s full, I mean the -- in the book. And many thing, many way. Ah, you know. Q: Do you -- you have a d -- a duel citizenship? A: I have now a double citizen. Before it wa s not possible. I mean, when I came here from Belgium, you renounce your Belgium nationality. Q: You renounced your -- A: But then again, the notion of citizensh -- Q: Was that painful for you to renounce it? A: Ma -- no. That was not -- not all. Because I made such a difference between a heritage and a situation. And -- and -- and I never asked to go in the Belgian army to defend so-called the king, okay? The king , for me, was a -- a collaborator, the first one, during the war, of course, huh? Meaning th at I put this all in -- in perspective. And I didn™t come, mind you, American before , I was here seven years. You have to wait five years, a -- two more years, and as w-we talk about the legendary Irving Brown, he say, you know, one thing done, forget your her itage, okay? And -- and I -- he was more French than American anyway, live in Europe all his life. I recognize from one of the best [indecipherable] in France , etcetera, then it doesn™t mean an -- really, when you have this international outlook. This is when somebody say, oh you -- your daughter work in Germany. I say, ah, I know -- w-w -- there™s no meaning. She could have work in Italy or something else. What is important with -- with all that, a- Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 116and th-the race of Islamic, you know, i-infiltr ation in ji -- i-i-in the labor movement, in political life and in the society, i-is ta -- to remember that Europe is still divided between many [indecipherable] and the case of Bosnia, Serogovia, the fall of Yugoslavia . I say everybody can be tomorrow a murderer if you -- if you don™t pay atten -- e-everybody can be manipulated in their thinking, in one way or the other, very easily. Where people can be convinced, you know, that Clinton was a great president, or you know, it may be, maybe not, but anyw ay, he™s not one of the greatest in this country anyway. A-And -- and the same can be said from -- from the president, who is now here. It is a -- a -- a -- a state of the development of co untry, of nation, and of the political life. What we can control, and what we cannot control. What a free society means. And now came all those great [indecipherable] thinker even today, in [indecipherable] etcetera. He said, election is not a proof of democracy. But we knew this many, many years, that you know, the f act impose, practically, an election, doesn™t mean anything in many countries of the world. Either it™s still tribal and you talk about feeling of nationality there -- th-th-th-th-their responsibility is vis-à-vis their tribe. It™s not the [indecipherable] their country. And there is nothing in this concept of country, of nation. They simply do not exist. Q: Well, you -- I know you talked about, you know, feeling very international, and -- A: Yeah. Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 117Q: -- obviously traveling all over the world. Do you have any particular feelings about Germany because of World War II? A: Oh, of course. Q: Are you comfortable when you™re there, when you visit? A: I wa -- no, I visit two or three time, I™m not comfortable. Q: Why not? A: I think, you know -- I remember in Berlin, sitting in -- in -- in a restaurant, you know. There were some very old couple. I think th-th-they look at me, you know, and they may -- and I™m -- and they must have been, you know, concentration camp guards, who else, you know, and thing li -- you don™t know. You don™t know. Going to Germany two, three -- I went to Berlin in fir -- first time in ™56, you know, and -- and the question was not the old Germany, it was the east Germany, you know, a-and the west Germany, what we do to rebuild them, and th -- the -- th-the -- the -- the -- the -- the acceptance of a occupation policy, who was not very wi -- wi -- all the aspect of which are not -- we cannot be very proud, because we use, you know, th-the-the police, we use -- etcetera, you -- i-is simply bring back of what the contemporary situation with Iraq, where we did not want to use the army in the [indecipherable] of Saddam. And the fact that we didn™t do that was a great mistake, because we didn™t do it in Germany, but -- or in Japan, certainly not. Then -- no, I feel co -- uncomfortable there. But I must say I feel uncomfortable in every -- any country where I don™t know Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 118the language, or they don™t understand, you know. I -- I -- I never went, because of political reason -- well, I went afterward -- to Spain or Portugal , because they were under dictatorship and we find -- that™s when I was in the young [indecipherable] I went back -- Q: So it™s interesting, it™s because of your professional background -- A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Q: -- and your political background, not because of your childhood experiences. A: No, no, no, no. This imme diately, you know, dissipated, because of -- of -- I don™t know. Q: Have you met other hidden children? A: Oh yeah, sure. Sure, sure. Q: And do you feel a connection to them? A: Oh yeah, sure, sure. Either because I -- I think I refer -- we were member of the Maccabee. Even though -- and Maccabee was a, as you know, mo-mostly a sports, you know, activity. We had the gymnasium, and the ping pong, etcetera. But they -- there were some lecture, you know, on -- on Jewish life, etcetera. There were artistic group, etcetera. And we knew that we choose Maccabee , not to be in the Zionist group, or not to be in the traditional Orthodox Jews, which didn™t exist anyway in Brussels, they were all in Antwerp, you see. And -- and then we -- we had many debates, you see? But the ones who are here were the -- the ones who -- who -- who Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 119decided to -- to move on, you know, with the briti -- with the Jewish background and -- and that™s it. Many people like me went very early to Israel, and we ca -- went back -- I went back twice or three times. Q: Do you feel a special connection to -- A: Oh yes, sure. Sure. This is another issue. This was the Jewish state and this was the -- let™s say an history was started much earlier, under the British empire and [indecipherable] and all that, yes. And of course we will -- defended -- there™s no -- no -- when I visit the afri -- the -- the Arab countries, my boss, Irving Brown at that time, when we were in Tunis [indecipherable] the Palestinian came a-and want to talk to Irving. Irving says, go to David. He didn™t want to talk to them. Then we sit down and I said, glad to talk to you , okay, but if you raise the question of Israel, there™s no deal, okay? Can talk about anything you want. At that time they didn't even want -- they were not talking about a Palestinian states or nothing. They want just to be anti-Israeli and a colonial state, or an imperial state. I had many contact, but again, through the years he became very dangerous, you know, in terms that we were close from the -- the exile group, even from inside and outside the Tunisian of the [indecipherable] Algeria. And people were -- my friend were assassinated. It is another story, I can tell you where we ha d, for instance, the liberation movement against the French in Algeria. I visited the border [indecipherable] kind from Tunisia, Morocco, all that. But the people we are dealing with were eliminated by Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 120their own people after they took independen ce, you know, their friends had been torn out from this -- from stairways and things, oh, terrible. Some were assassinated in Paris, which I knew and I was very con -- of course, concern about it. But again, when you talk to a -- a guy like Irving Brown, he accepted that [indecipherable] and never talk about that. His best friend die [indecipherable] never talk about that. And we were involved in all kind of operation, etcetera, and -- and as a joke with my wife and children, when I was awarded, you know, commander honor of this award, national award, you know, th -- of this officer, of that, and the other, and chevalier -- knights of that. Senegal and -- and Doumay , and -- Senegal, Doumay , and oh, what™s the third? Togo, huh. And I came back each time so proud of the men [indecipherable] that they laugh at me. And the na -- the big, you know, diploma, I wanted to put this in my little [indecipherable] no, no. It™s only -- it™s a true story, of course, like everything I told you, of course. I brought it from the baseme nt and I put it back, two of them. One is too big in the -- in my guestroom, and the othe r one is too big, I -- I left in that. And then people are asking me, but why did you get? I say, look, this is to organize a ch -- regime change, the other was to oppose one. And -- and things like that. But that™s another aspect, and I think it™s very well describe in -- in several books. Q: What was your reaction during the Eichmann trial, do you remember? A: Oh yes, of course. We were all in favor of it, and I think my wife wants nothing to do with all that -- with [indecipherable] conservative says, why a trial? Kill him Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 121[indecipherable] you know? It™s like what she said things about the -- the unfortunately situation with the killings in school, etcetera [indecipherable] I say, why do you go thr -- they go all through that, you know? Each time somebody -- Q: Well, I was wondering, did it make you thin k of the loss of your mother, the loss of your sister? A: Oh yeah -- Q: Did it -- did it bring you right back? A: -- th-the -- oh no, the -- yeah. Q: That™s what I meant. A: Yeah, the whole tragedy o-of that period, of course. And when there is -- I don™t know whether before, I was going some movie a-about, you know, Eichmann arrest, or about the -- the thing, but you know, in the book on the Belgium deportation that there is upst-upstairs [indecipherable] that I have it at home, you know, with the list of the convoy, etcetera, there is, at the end, the trial in Kohn, Germany of the mi -- the one who did all that in Belgium, okay? H-he went free after five years. Then, for me it™s another a-aspect, it™s a -- it™s really showing that -- that the society evolves, that this thing of remembrance, it™s -- i-i-i-it™s something personal, but when you are involve in all those acts, there is no justice, you know, only for the few. [indecipherable] Nuremberg and all that, it™s only a few, what, 20 people, or 50 people. Of course, what we did with denazification in Germany was excellent, of Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 122course, excellent. And th-there became, like in Italy, etcetera, recognition that people have to live with the regime that they have, you know, and as I mentioned before, the populace, the people are -- are subject to so much more [indecipherable] that today™s -- even an election in a s-so-c alled civilized country has di fferent meaning for different people. Q: What is your feeling coming into the Holocaust Museum building? A: The first time? I went there three times. I went here -- Q: No, I™m talking about this -- A: Yeah, yeah, I went -- Q: -- th-this one in Washington. A: -- three time. Oh yes. I decided -- Q: Do you have any emotional reaction when you come to it? A: No, I have more -- better illustration of some of the -- th-the situation. I went to -- in the [indecipherable] where you can follow the deportation on the screen, you know? Then I look at Belgium and I say, that™s not enough, it™s not even very -- it™s quickly done. I don™t think that they show any -- you cannot s -- have any remor -- or any comment, you know. I-I went back because they have something of a list, my aunt who ca -- before she fa -- came here and then before she died -- you know, there is -- her name is on it, but her husband name is not on it, you know. Certainly mine is not on it, because I never put it, nobody ask, you see? The best place is the reflection, you Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 123know, pool there, with the wall, that™s important. But to go through a place with all the photos of -- of people deport -- I™ve seen that, I-I -- you know, it has no -- you know, I™ve -- this I know about Belgium, etcetera. This I know. And to have a little [indecipherable] around Belgium doesn™t mean, you know, anything. Because they concentrate on Poland , on the big countries. Q: Do you belong to any hidden children organizations? A: Yeah, well, to -- no, yes? Q: I mean, here in the United States? A: Oh, no, no. Q: That™s [indecipherable] A: I tried to contact one, I saw somebody te stify in front -- before the Congress. Some guy who -- who supposed to have a group to defend the survi -- the children of the survivors, etcetera. I look on the Web, and I couldn™t find him. But no, I am -- I was really, lately, interested in that, and it™s only because I -- I was on the -- with this Belgium, you know, all these thing that they put on, and -- and that I pursue [indecipherable] this thing, but I would not be member of anything. I™m never ask anything, ju -- this thing really, has been practically through in my head, but -- and I accepted it, voluntary. I would not have accepted 50 years ago, I never accepted it. And while on the basis of all those things, you are [indecipherable] you are not accepted if you have receive compensation from the German claim. You know, you Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 124cannot have both. And now I kn ow that some people got German ca -- oh yes, a lot of them, but they cannot get this [indecipherable] etcetera, because you are -- which is totally incomplete. I don™t know if I have to say that. You ge -- you put the wrong address, you don™t take that. And with this whole business of the non-payment of an insurance premium was just -- Q: Yeah, right. A: -- a criminal kind of thing. Either you say if your -- you ha -- you had one or not. Because if you had one, it must have been a very -- Q: Is -- is there -- is there anything el se you wanted to add to the interview -- A: No, that -- Q: -- or do you feel you™ve expressed your thoughts? A: -- no, I am pleased to -- on this opportunity, for what it may be worth, and I think it™s a kind of a -- of a normal, let™s say duty in terms that I know more because of this research being done, okay?
