A: I don™t know what to tell you, I just give you the story, what was, the time was witnesses to this. They begged to them, gi ve us money, give us something that you give away to the German, we™ll buy some and try to survive. Maybe 25 percent would survive, but give us something.

Because if he knew how to deal Œ A: I think so, I think so, yeah. Q: Yeah? A: My father was a strong man. Q: Yeah. Do you think that it was also, because he knew so many people, that that helped you in Œ when he knew so many pe ople in the villages, and the surrounding area, and when you would knock on so meone™s door and say, I™m his son Œ A: I Œ I didn™t know too many.
