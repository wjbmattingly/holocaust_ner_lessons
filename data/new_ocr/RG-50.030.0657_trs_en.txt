It™s very unusual that there would be a town in Lithuania that has 7,000 people, that would also have Interview with Pranas Jurkus April 30, 2012 20somebody who is truly from the old aristocr acy, the Polish-Lithuanian aristocracy. Not every town had such members. A: Yeah, but that Œ that was a Œ considered a big one. They had the ponds, they had their Œ their own electricity.

And that was the exchange, repatriation, what you call in Lithuania . And my mother™s brother, Interview with Pranas Jurkus April 30, 2012 58Tarmynas (ph), came from Klaipeda to Kretinga. And then he was Œ because then he was trusted Soviet citizen, let™s say, he was given a position in kedainai (ph) or someplace. And we say, why do you do that? He couldn™t understand, he didn™t want to live under Hitler. But we knew already that. Q: So you Œ A: There are two devils; one is brown, one is red. And to choose between two devils, you rather would choose the brown. That time, really I™m not lying, that time was already evident that the Soviet Union was cruel.

A: Oh yeah, little bit, okay. Q: But Œ so the first time that I sense that their Œ that this world that you describe to me in Klaipeda has a huge change, is when Hitler takes over Memel and klai Œ the first time Œ A: Yeah. Q: Œ yeah, that Kretinga, the world that you lived in gets changed, is when Hitler takes over the port city of Memel and klai Œ Memel and German Klaipeda, and Lithuanian Œ Interview with Pranas Jurkus April 30, 2012 59A: Yeah.

Q: Okay, so here™s another question, when those Lithuanians came, and I said, well what did they say, and you Œ you said, well, that Germany™s taken over, I™m going after more of, let™s say their experiences, their details, where they were, did they have discrimination in work, did they ha Œ were they Œ A: On what time?

But we kids, we didn™t know. We kids, we didn™t know, we just sensed that there is a tension, there is a tension, there is a tension. The parents always talk, what will happen to the kids, what will happen to us, how they will live, how they Œ how their future is.

Now, I cannot imagine. People start to disa ppear, and Œ and they start to, about half an hour, the people hit, when they cannot walk any more, when they fall on that, and they pretend like they are dead, the othe r prisoners have to take them, and put in the pond, 300 feet away in the pond, where I Œ to revive. Q: Is that a pond where you used to ice skate? A: Yeah. They had to revive . Now, when the Œ the people who cannot, you Œ they are all dead, they want to drown themselves.

And now is over, next day, in the evening already, the city farmers, who lived li Œ outside little bit, with Interview with Pranas Jurkus April 30, 2012 117the horses and wagons, they are called next morning to take the dead ones and bring to the Jewish cemetery. Q: So they™re ordered to do so? A: They were ordered. And we knew that Œ that Œ that in the morning early, we were Œ [break] Œ we were there already looking. What Œ what they Œ how they will do. Q: What did they do? A: That Œ you know, the Œ the Œ the farmers, they Œ the Germans offer them a fork, with a fork to take a body. The Lithuanians, they wi Œ say no, we don™t want. We take two Œ two Œ two men, one body, and we put in a Œ in the wagon, there were three wagons, I think, and we bring that. They di Œ they refused that. Now Œ and they bring to the Jewish cemetery and th ey bury there. Okay, now what I heard. Then the farmers started to tell. The couple guys were still alive, and when they Œ when they took the body, he resisted, or he wanted Œ wanted to chok e, tha-that was told, I was told. He wanted to choke. Now I am thinking that could be true, because in the evening, we saw some breathing, but we didn™t say anything. I Œ I saw some Œ some like breathing. It was Œ Q: The evening before. A: Even before, in the evening. Interview with Pranas Jurkus April 30, 2012 118Q: Yeah. A: It could be that was still alive, but I didn™t see that [indecipherable] was choking. Q: So if I can understand, the Œ the Œ the Œ the men who were in the pit, who were supposedly dead, were taken out the next morning, and the one who was still alive wanted to choke the one who was taking him. A: Well Œ well, yeah, to choke. Q: Okay. A: Or reflex or whatever Œ Q: Yeah. A: I was just Œ Q: Of course. A: There was a rumor. Q: Of course, of course. A: But I did Œ did Œ de ducted or detected Œ Q: Yeah. A: The Œ only Œ only I, that yes, we saw that one was Œ or two were breathing, were still alive, although was already put in that with all the lime and Œ and everything. That could have been. That could have been. But this is Œ the fact can tell only that Interview with Pranas Jurkus April 30, 2012 119the farmer who was Œ no Œ and Œ and that was Œ was quite Œ and the city was terrible Œ terrible atmosphere in the city, and Œ an d just depressed, people depressed. People could not believe that the Germans could do that. Q: And were they Œ di d they talk about it? A: They talked just Œ just very mute. Q: Very quietly then. A: Very quietly. They Œ they didn™t want to talk. Nobody wants to talk about anything that time. The kids, we talked that we saw that and that and so on. Now, that time when they ended, they announced that next Sunday the same. Now, not to extend th-the story, next Sunday was the same. The same people down. There is an-another probably 30. They caught another bunch of hidden pe ople. And the ones who were already dirty, with Œ with Œ w-with the Œ with the wounds, with everything, and I saw how the German, with Œ with Œ with sword, cut one, the ear was hanging here, I saw that. You imagine, how could I live not Œ not putting this to history? Was hanging. I don™t know if th Œ he survived or not , but that time when they ran around. Now the people came and you could det ect which one was torture already, which came with the nice suit, nice shirt and everything. And after a half an hour, they all looked the same. The same scenery, the same torture, the same beating. Now, if the same so ldiers beat, I cannot tell. I don™t recognize that Œ that Œ Interview with Pranas Jurkus April 30, 2012 120the Germans. All uniforms, and only was summertime, and you know how they were Œ Q: What color were the uniforms? A: Greenish. Infantry. Infantry SS. Not the black. Q: Okay, and so they weren™ t Œ and they weren™t regular Wehrmacht? As far as Œ A: Not the regular wehr Œ regular Wehrmacht, only about five were guarding around, because, you know, they feared that could escape, could run or Œ or Œ or jump someplace. And second time. Now, second time, there were no people looking. Germans were angry, and I think they told through the translator that Œ why people don™t want to see those vertrai Œ those Œ Q: Say it in German. A: Yeah. Q: Those what? A: Those [indecipherable] that Œ that™s Œ no Œ criminals Œ Q: [indecipherable] okay. A: Œ or criminals or whatever, who Œ yo u know, who Œ who e Œ ate you before, who torture you there. And so kids came, so me other came, we would watch again. Q: You were kids. Interview with Pranas Jurkus April 30, 2012 121A: I Œ yeah. We ah, kids or Œ or Œ or teenag ers, or Œ and the same, little bit shorter Œ [phone ringing] Q: Excuse me for a minute. I™m so sorry. I should have turned it off, but I will Œ Q2: Do you want me to pause? Q: Yes, please. Q2: Okay, pausing. [break] Q: I™m sorry for the interruption. Can you tell me the second time you saw these events, you say the Germans were angry that no Œ A: There were no spectators. Q: That™s right. A: Or lack of spectators what they expected. Q: Okay. A: They expected Œ that is my assumption Œ they expected there would be, you know, enjoyment to everyone. Enjoyment? You see what enjoyment, you know. You torture animals, you don™t have enjo yment. Anyway, and the same procedure. Reviving was dragged into the pond and ba ck, revived and beaten, beaten, beaten until they couldn™t walk or so. And I remember that time, I don™t know if I was until the end or not, they were ag ain put in the prison, and supposed to be third Sunday. You imagine, every Sunday was spoiled for all the Kretinga that Œ that walk, the Interview with Pranas Jurkus April 30, 2012 122people™s enjoyment, with that kind of things. And I didn™t see that Œ the third one, I don™t remember. And if I would remember, I would repeat the same. Is irrelevant now, that Œ that Œ that Œ but some told me that even was just a few people, the fourth Sunday. I Œ I don™t know. I mention in my writing that Œ that somebody claims, but I Œ I don™t Œ I don™t want. No Œ and Œ and that was over, and all what I have seen. But I Œ Q: And then Œ and then you as Œ do you assume that then if they weren™t killed during this kind of torture, then they Œ th o-tho-those who survived were simply shot later? A: Shot later. No Œ no one survived. No one. If they didn™t die there at the place, the torture place, they died in the prison. They Œ they were not fed, they were not Œ not Œ no Œ not care, nothing. [indecipherable] yeah. Q: And did you n Œ did any of the people look familiar? Would they Œ did you know to Œ nothing. A: Not one man, not Œ not one. Probably some Œ some recognized, but I don™t. Q: Yeah. A: I Œ I didn™t recognize any one. Q: The second time when you were there, you say it was only kids, and maybe some teenagers. Interview with Pranas Jurkus April 30, 2012 123A: There were some people too, there were some people, but Œ Q: Grown-ups. A: Œ not that masses, not like the first time Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ that everybody do Œ what Œ what Œ what will be there. Because that Œ that Œ Q: Was this Œ A: Œ sa Œ sane people cannot stand it. Q: Well, here™s another question. You say th at Œ you say that Œ that they ruined the Sunday, you know, the Œ the Sunday walk. But was that the reason why people didn™t talk, or Œ or was it that they were horrified? A: Horrified. I Œ I would assume. The Œ now I™m just speculating, I™m guessing. Q: Yeah. A: They were Œ they were stunned that why they should do that? The first [indecipherable] they were put in the Œ in the Œ in the ditches and shot, and that™s it. You know, that Œ that™s something else, but the torture. And you know, like si Œ little bit Œ little bit e-e-ex-ex-exploring that, the NKVD, or the Œ the Russians tortured, but Germans don™t torture. They exterminate, but they don™t torture. But why they Œ why they wanted this one Œ an d I don™t believe that such a Œ such a program was anyplace else. I have not heard, and like Eidintas did not write? Interview with Pranas Jurkus April 30, 2012 124Q: He™s an historian, right? A: Yeah. And nobody else has published like that. Q: Have you ever heard Œ A: Why someone who was, that time of Œ in the 20™s, in 25 or so, they knew that, Kretinga knew what was happening. I™m not the only one who witnessed that. Why nobody else comes? Why nobody el Œ calls Pranas, your article is interesting, I Œ I have seen. No. No one. It seems that I™m li Œ like a Œ like a liar. Q: You feel that? A: You know, I was disappointed. I was disappointed with you a little bit, you know, that you don™t call. Because I said why? Because no Lithuanian was participating. This atrocity, done in Lithuania , in my hometown, and done by Germans. Q: Yeah. A: Ca Œ to show Lithuanians. You know Lithuanian, there were Lithuanian tortured my Germans, too, oh, concentration camp and everything. Oh yeah, Lithuanians, especially in Memelland, in Œ in Œ in Œ who had some thing to do with the Œ the process. That was in 1936 Œ Q: Oh, you mean the trial against the Nazis. A: The trial a-a-against Neumann and Sass, yeah. Interview with Pranas Jurkus April 30, 2012 125Q: What do you know about that? A: I know from history only. Q: Okay. A: Yeah. But from Œ they Œ somebody could have responded to me more. Couple guys call me and say, ah Pranas , you know, oh, everypla ce happened that. So I know, tell me. And I Œ I Œ I showed the big book. And the big book, nothing. And I Œ I think you s Œ you told that there is something about Kretinga in the museum archives, something similar. Q: Well, I heard Œ I saw some information. There™s not much. There™s not much. A: No, but not s Œ not such a thing which I™m telling now. Q: No, not that A: No. Q: Not that, not that. Now Œ A: And I Œ I Œ I Œ I want to tell that. I want to tell that Œ that, you know, somehow is a part of that tragedy which we have no t solved yet between us, between Jews and Lithuanians. And I always see still the artic les, or the accusations and this and that. No comment. I want to give what I have seen. You judge. Q: I want to find out from you, after these events Œ after these events, ho-how is the atmosphere in the town? Interview with Pranas Jurkus April 30, 2012 126A: Just terrible. Terrible. Q: In what way? A: Just terrible. You imagine that Kretinga should be the now atop of the world in such atrocities. Well, there™s not. There™s a Kaunas fort, Fort Five, or whatever. Q: The Ninth Fort. A: Yeah. Was there more? Was there more? No, they were shot, were shot. But not such a thing. And I could give you the Œ the Œ the place, the Œ where the people were, where the torturing were, how it was, how the pond is. I could draw you a Œ a map. Q: Tell me, when Œ the second time you went , and you came home, did your parents still not want to talk about it? Did you tell your parents what you saw? A: They didn™t ask me, they didn™t ta lk. Becau Œ I Œ we were very free Lithuania. We Œ the parents used to tell, be for lunch, but where you go in summertime, what you do Œ we didn™t work, you know. Q: Yeah. A: School, we didn™t ne-need to work. Soviet time, we had to work in a Œ in a Œ the Skavaches (ph) Œ the Skavaches(ph) garden. But by Germans we didn™t have to work.

A: Not much. Not much. It was Œ it was assumed that you saw, I saw, there is nothing m Œ no-nothing more to talk. Nothin g more to talk. A tragedy. I don™t know how Œ how to describe the tragedy. In this age, when Œ oh, when I tell you, I Œ I could say that tragedy the top of the world, but that time? Event of the day. Event of the day. Cruel, yes. Like I sa y, if somebody h-hits me or Œ or Œ or pokes me, it hurts me. I know that people hurt. The people hurt, but there was such a notion that guilty, guilty. Who is guilty? No one is guilty, guilty ta Œ the one who is doing that. Q: What I™m trying to get a sense of, is how did it work inside of you when you see this? Were you numb, were yo u sh Œ were you terrorized, were you stunned, were you Œ A: I was terrorized, I was Œ at that time? Q: At that time. A: At that time I was neither terrorized nor stunned. Astonished little bit that I Œ I witnessed such a thing, and it was inside me which I carried when I Œ I said I carried so many years. So many years, I had no one to talk, no one would actually Œ Interview with Pranas Jurkus April 30, 2012 128would listen that. They would say, like I repeating, they would say, yeah, everyplace was. There was a this Œ this and Œ and Œ and that. But I never ex Œ I never heard anyplace else, how much I read and everything. Was all shooting, extermination, concentration camp. Some to rturing most likely in Œ in a Œ in Œ you know, in prison, but not that open. Three or four Sundays, to show the little town. Yeah. Q: Was there a time when you wanted to talk and there was nobody to listen? A: Probably it was. I knew one thing, that I will not forget, and I will write. And I will write. Now I come to that. And I ca Œ and I see my age is going Œ you know, we™re getting older, days are passing, and this event I will take to Œ to my grave? No. I told myself no. And then happened that I saw there a Captain Sporelli(ph) in the Œ in the film, and I start in the beginning for that, I say here is th Œ my Œ my clue or my incentive to write what happened in my country. And I start and I finish. And I say why this had to happen to us? Q: You first wrote about this publicly in 2010? A: 2010, November six. Q: And it was published where? A: In Chicago , in Drogas(ph) daily newspaper. Q: And it™s a Lithuanian language newspaper? Interview with Pranas Jurkus April 30, 2012 129A: Lithuanian language newspaper.

And the editor did not had time to read that or to give me a comments. And I was little bit unhappy when Œ when Œ when, and she never returned that to me. The one I wrote, I did not correct much. I only gave to my sister. My sister said, I was three or four years younger, I don™t remember much. She only remembered that she saw some torturing Œ Soviets torture Lithuanians. She was that, as a schoolgirl, put that Œ to look at that. She remembered that. Otherwise she doesn™t remember. Parent did not Œ th ey Œ parents did not talk. S hould be kids on their own who Œ who would kind of search, think about, or whatever. And then that Œ then we only heard later, you know, what happened th ere, what happened there that 1941, what happened in Kaunas. Q: When you™re talking Œ now let™s go back to Kretinga and Œ [technical interruption] A: Okay, no we Œ we almost Œ Q: No, we™re not done. Interview with Pranas Jurkus April 30, 2012 130A: No? Q: We™re not done. No, no, no, because I want to talk about Kretinga afterwards. A: Okay. Q: [inaudible] So, you said that after this, people were quiet, they didn™t talk, they were stunned in the town. That you haven™t heard of anyt hing else that happened in quite such a similar fashion elsewhere. What Œ did an y Œ did life normalize at any point, or do you think Kretinga was changed forever? A: I think it was Œ was fairly normalized. Normali Œ the front was far away. There was already Kaunas taken, was Vilnius taken, the Germans were in Œ in Russia . German administration, the military admi nistration was changed to Œ to civil German administration, although the lowe r echelons were Lithuanians, but was German. German regime. And you have to [indecipherable] , you have to [indecipherable] because you don™t know. Some people were taken, deported. Q: To Germany. A: To Germany. Some girls who were a little bit l oose, they were pointed out and the Germans took them to Germany. There were no mass deportations to Germany for work.

A: They were star Œ I don™ t know when they started, and I don™t know when they finished, but I know they finished, definitely. They didn™t let them go. There was no in Œ no Œ no Œ no intention. And some people who lived there, not far away, although it was far away to [indecipherable] is that Œ that™s like a Œ like a free land. The Jewish cemetery was very isolated by woods, by trees, and so that nobody heard, nobody Œ nobody knew. And I think there were some incidents. You know, we still had German occupation for years. Q: But that™s what I want to find out about. A: Yeah. But that™s non-event. It was war. German nationalized what they could. They took cattle, they took pigs, they took horses, they took everything what they have with the Œ and 1941 wa s fine, 1942 the front started and east was going bad, that Lithuania was short of food, short of everything.

When you were still there. A: Yeah. Q: Okay. A: So, I just heard. Q: Okay. So, I™m trying to get a sense of how much one would know at that time. Not much, it sounds like. A: What my Œ my understandi ng is that there were not many left. There were not many left Œ left, who hid themselves and somehow survived, because that started the partisan times. There were Soviet partisans and there were Lithuanian partisans. Interview with Pranas Jurkus April 30, 2012 143Lithuanian partisans fought the Soviet pa rtisans and German pa rtisans.

A: It changed. Q: In what way? Interview with Pranas Jurkus April 30, 2012 147A: It changed when I grew up. When I grew up, it changed. It changed that the Œ to subject one what I don™t want, to pain so me other one. If you break, if you do, if you beat. And, you know, when I was young, I was little bit, you know, edgy and so, you know, [indecipherable] and Œ and hitting something. After that, I had never had a fight in my life.

Bu t I was in a Œ in a Germany, or Œ or something, or Œ or some disagreement with some friend or something, I never wanted to get in a fight. Not that I was afraid that I will not win. You know, you just protect yo urself. But no, but just Œ just a Œ now, when I see grown people fighting, or the lithu Œ you know, Lithuanian fights, especially [indecipherable] you know, when Œ when they Œ they get drunk and they fight. And I never smoked in my life and I don™t dr ink. I drink socially, but I Œ my father was drinking and I swore to myself, I will not subject my family what he subjected us. And there is a story, laughing story to tell. Q: Yeah. A: Yeah. Q: But Œ but so, what you saw did change you. A: Change, change. Interview with Pranas Jurkus April 30, 2012 148Q: Yeah. A: And when I see now Œ when I Œ you know, I watch the movies and everything, and I see those tortures. And especially now recently was history channel about the Œ the Œ the Third Reich and the fall. And th ey showed pictures, and after that they showed the Germans, how they have to go to Dachau and take care of the bodies, and you see Œ and I think it was good.

But not all Germans too. Q: No. A: Germans fought quite a bit against that. Q: There were some. A: But about Germans in Œ in Klaipeda , I have nothing good. Q: The other thing I wanted to ask you about is that it took a long time, if we talk about 2010, when you wrote this artic le and you had it published Œ maybe you passed it in 2008, but it sat in you for a long time, until you were ready to speak. A: It™s Œ it sat, yeah. Q: Why did it take so long, do you think? Interview with Pranas Jurkus April 30, 2012 149A: I think I mentioned a little bit that I was not sure if I should reveal this. I was Œ I knew that one day, after me, or before me or whatever, I have to tell. But there was my personal neglect. I always set prioritie s.

A: And I™m sorry that I was lazy, I could not, at least part translate too. Q: Now, I want to ask you. You menti oned in your book that you wrote about everything, but you didn™t write about this part in your book, about what happened to the Jews. A: No, I didn™t write, I didn™t. Q: And why would that be? Why would you leave it out? A: Well, because that Œ but that time, what I wrote in that book, I wrote my high school, how I left Lithuania and how I started high school in Germany. Q: Oh, so you li Œ you don™t talk about before? A: No. Q: Okay. A: No. The Œ in Germany.

I don™t have the patience, I don™t have time. And that book wa s published when my first wife was already with Alzheimer™s. Q: Oh dear. A: And I was in such a hurry, I ask my friends, group, we had the group, that we all contribute. If we publish the book, each one part. And I waited three or four years; nobody responded like to this article. Nobody wants to talk. Q: Why? Why do you think that™s the case? A: Yeah. Nobody Œ nobody calls me, nobo dy there. There probably are some Lithuanians someplace, but no. Q: Nobody was interested in what you had revealed there? A: No, no. And when I ask, di Œ have y ou read? No. I say, was in two pages, in Saturday publication. Q: The most read publication of that newspaper. Interview with Pranas Jurkus April 30, 2012 152A: Yeah.

And that™s little bit, kind of angered me that was not enough response for th Œ [break] Œ and I hope, therefore that this will be the contribution to your museum, and to the relationship between the Jews, the folks, and the Lithuanian folks. Q: Thank you. Thank you very much. If there™ s anything else you™d like to add, that I haven™t talked to you about Œ A: Nothing. I Œ I wanted, because there is no lie, nothing is a lie. So if Œ if there is some doubt, there is not intentionally, but probably. Because I went to Lithuania special, on a trip. I went there, I measured, I looked. I walked around the pond, and this one, that I don™t make mistake. And in th at article is much mo re than I told you today. An explicit. Q: Yeah.

They don™t want to know that such things Interview with Pranas Jurkus April 30, 2012 153happened. Because there is always some needle come out from someplace. There are some people who probably feel, and to publish this one, there would be sensation. And when I went to Lithuania , when I presented in Kretinga, in a church meeting, I presented my book, because I am from Kretinga, there were about hundred people. I give presentation.
