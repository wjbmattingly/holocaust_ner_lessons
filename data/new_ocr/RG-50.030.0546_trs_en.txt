It is November 9th, 2008, and we are in Alexandria, Virginia. Good afternoon. Answer: Good afternoon. Q: Why don™t you start by telling me where you were bo rn, when you were born and what your name was at birth. A: Okay. I was born in Œ on November 29 th, 1936, in Cluj, Kolozsvár, or Klausenburg , depending. Klausenburg is the Yiddish word, but depending who was in power, the name was different. My Œ Q: And who was in power when you were born? A: Actually, I believe it was Hungaria. Q: Mm-hm. A: And Œ no, it was Romania , because as a little girl I remember standing and greeting the Hungarian soldie rs coming into town, okay. Q: Okay. A: So it was Romania, then it became Hungary. But as I recall, I spoke most of my life, as a young child, only Hungarian, I don™t remember speaking Romanian. Q: Mm-hm. Interview with Eva Brettler November 9, 2008 4A: My father Œ my maiden name is Eva Katz. My father was one of 10 children, and my mother Œ his name is Aleksander(ph) Katz, or Alexander Katz, depending where Œ you know, what paper it appe ars. And my mother™s name is Margit Katz, her maiden name is Roth, r-o-t-h, and she was one of six children. I believe both of them were the second children in the family. My father became a printer, and my mother was a hat maker, and I love beautiful hats. I remember we lived in a very nice apartment, it was a multiple unit apartment. And I have some memories of being in Kolozsvár . I never called it Cluj til later. And I had a vivid, active life. I remember being spoiled. Q: Were you Œ were you an only child? A: I was the only child. My Œ I remember once I was being punished because early age on I was kind of looking around and I ended up in a Christian church, a big Catholic church. There was music coming out of it and I went in and my poor mother was looking for me. And I ended up being punished, and my punishment was that my father took away my shoes, and my mother had to carry me. And I was a little Œ kind of bad, so I said, this is really no punishment. I loved being carried by my mother, so my father got pretty angry [indecipherable]. So early age on I had a certain amount of independent spirit. A nd we moved, I think my parents moved there when they got married, so they didn™t have as many friends. And I remember Interview with Eva Brettler November 9, 2008 5my mother kind of talking to me always about what was going on. I was her little confidant, which continued. Unfortunately, she died at age 28, so it was to Œ for a very short time. Q: Was your Œ was your Œ I™m sorry to interrupt, was your Œ were you in a li Œ religious family? A: Both my father and mother came from very religious family, but I believe when they moved up to Cluj, some of the religion was left a little behind. And my father enjoyed playing cards, and I rememb er that causing some problem. Q: Mm-hm. A: He played chess and cards, and it wasn™t something what my mother was used to, so as a young girl I remember arguments about that. Q: Did you keep kosher til your move? A: We always kept kosher, yes. And I don™t recall my Œ I didn™t recall that my mother was working, but my aunt, who surviv ed, her aunt Œ my aunt is my father™s younger sister, her name is Ibby(ph) Steinberger(ph) now. She remembers that when I was a baby, she came over to watch me while my mother went to work. But for some reason, I had no recollection of th at. My mother always dressed beautiful, and she was a very beautiful lady. And we ended up moving because my father Interview with Eva Brettler November 9, 2008 6heard what was happening around him, and he was worried that in a small city, people know us. Q: Mm-hm. A: And if we go up to Budapest, we would have a better opportunity to survive. Even though most of the people didn™t be lieve it can happen where we lived. It may happen in Poland , but it won™t happen in Kolozsvár . So my father went up and secured in a Œ a room in Budapest, and there was such a tremendous amount of shortage of Œ of apartments already. It mu st have been either I was four or five, I have no recollection of the date. And my father talked very little about my life before the war, after I came back. And we moved up to Budapest and all of a sudden we had to share one apartment un it with several families. And I remember that was a little difficult. And my moth er™s father, who had long beard and payos , you know, the usual, sometimes he stayed with us. And in one room my father lived, my mother, I, and occasionally my grandfather. And it was ov Œ you know, crowded, and there were some arguments about that. I have very, very precious memories of my grandfather. He always had real deep pockets and always some goodies for me. He spoiled me what ever way he could. And when the Œ the Nyilas(ph), which is the Arrow Cross came into power, I remember that once he came home all beaten up, bloody, part of his payos being pulled out. And after that Interview with Eva Brettler November 9, 2008 7I never seen him. He came to us, and he ki nd of Œ I don™t know where he went, but that was the last time I seen him. My father went to work as a printer, and my mother continued working as a Œ as a ha t maker. And when th e war broke out, I happened to visit with my maternal grandmother in Tashnalt (ph), and they were Œ I was visiting with my grandmother and I have vivid recollection of that, that she was pre Œ baking challah, and the smell in the room was overwhelming. And all of a sudden they knocked on the door and they sa id the Jews are being collected in that city. And my aunt, younger aunt, her name is also Ibby(ph), my mother™s younger sister was there, and my grandmother, whose name was Sarah Roth , and she says, Eva, you are not Œ she didn™t call me Eva, she called me Havelah(ph) -- Havelah(ph), you are not listed on the list, you go and hide. And when it gets dark, you will go to the rabbi™s house, and they will send a message for your father to come and get you from Budapest. Tashnalt(ph) is pretty much in the Transylvania section. So my grandmother left, and I was hiding in the fields. And they usually kept the keys, I remember her locking up and po inting where she is putting the key. And I was ready to go inside when a group of Gypsies appeared. And I pretended that my grandmother was inside the house, because they had s Œ they were telling stories the Gypsies steal young children, and I didn't wanted to be stolen by Gypsies. And I pretended that my grandmother is in there, and I said, Interview with Eva Brettler November 9, 2008 8Grandma, Grandma, the Gypsies, don™t leave me alone. Naturally, everything is in Hungarian. And the Gypsies kind of stayed there on. And I said, just leave me alone, my grandma will come out and she will be very angry at you. And they left. And I felt like a sense of accomplishment. I could fool the Gypsies, I™d be able to go to the rabbi™s house. Q: Mm-hm. A: And I did. And I think a day or so later, my father came. He was note Œ my mother™s Œ my grandmother must have Œ the rabbi must have called my grandmother, and my grandmother se Œ and my mother send messa ge to my father, who was in a labor camp by then, what happ ened. And my father came to get me from the rabbi™s house. And my father had to wear his yellow star. And he told me, if by any chance something happens, and I™m being arrested, you go back to the rabbi™s house, and I will come and get you. As we were walking toward the railroad station, the police stopped my father and they took him in. And I think we had some kind of agreement where he motioned for me to go back. I™m seven, this had to be in April of ™44, so I™m seven and a half that time. Q: Right. Interview with Eva Brettler November 9, 2008 9A: And I go back to the rabbi™s house. My father is being kept overnight there and beaten up pretty bad. And he had the chutzpah that when they let him go, he did say why he came up. Q: Mm-hm. A: He asked for a Œ a note from the police station that they kept him overnight, because he had only a short duration he could come and get me. So he had the note. And next day when we went to the railroa d station, we got on the train, but my father couldn™t come inside the train. And before the train arrived, my father approached a woman with a young child, and ask her if she could take me, and pretend that I belong with her. And that™s what we did. My was Œ father was Œ I could see him from the window, he was between the railroad cars, you know, the open place where he could stay. And this lady started flirting with the German soldiers who were inside the train, and I was petrified. That time I didn™t speak anything Œ Q: Right. A: Œ I was quiet. And when we arrived to Budapest, my father tried to hold my hand, and I just run off. And I don™t know how I knew the way how to get home, but my father couldn™t catch up with me, I run all the way home. I wanted to be Œ I wanted my mother to hold me because she Œ she meant safety. Interview with Eva Brettler November 9, 2008 10Q: Mm-hm. A: A short time later where we lived, the apartment was being emptied. And we had the choice to go into the ghetto. And my mother secured papers to go into Œ I don™t remember if we went Œ I think we went first to the Swiss safe house. And when that was emptied, then we ende d up in the Swedish safe house. And I remember once when we were in the Swedish safe house, my mother hid me on a top of, you know those Œ in Europe you have those big cli Œ furnitures, you know, which opens up and you have Œ Q: Right. A: And on top of it was a basket, and she put me inside that basket, and she told me, Eva, you have to be very quiet, and even if you have to go to the bathroom, you just stay in that basket until I come and get you. Well, I was there for several hours, and I think my mother hid somewhere in Œ th ey had those, like in a elevator shaft [indecipherable] she was hid Œ hidden there. It was an elevator actually there. It was between the windows, which you know, it was like Œ I don™t see it here, but it Œ it™s like a place where windows look out, and th ere is really no access to it, and she Œ I thi Œ that™s what she told me, she was hidden in one of those places. When she came to get me, I remember I was wet, I was there for many, many hours. And she caressed me and told me everything is ok ay. And we were trying to sneak out from Interview with Eva Brettler November 9, 2008 11the building when the Hungarian policeman seen us. And she said Œ the policeman said, I don™t see you. Go. Q: Wow. A: So I remember my mother telling me that there is no other place for us, we will Œ I will get somewhere some false papers, false identity. And Œ I have to go back. The person from whom we rented the room wher e we stayed, she rented one room to us, and an other room to a woman who was actually a SS woman, became a SS woman. And the lady™s name whose apartment it was originally, and the place na Œ I remember the address, it was kira (ph) utsa(ph) tisanirt(ph). Kira(ph) is street number 15, and the lady™s name was Mrs. Gross. My mother befriended the person whose Œ who was the SS woman, the brother, and we hid with him for awhile. Q: Oh my. A: And I don™t know what was the reason, my mother felt that that wasn™t a safe place Œ Q: Right. A: Œ for Œ I don™t know what was the reason behind it. And that™s when she got a name and I got a new name. My name was Eva Noig (ph), and noig means in Hungarian big, so she says, now you are a big girl, and I™m going to enroll you to school. She enrolled me to school, we we re Œ she was dressed up, you know, very Interview with Eva Brettler November 9, 2008 12fashionable, and dressed me up pretty. An d I was accepted in the class and she found a new place. Q: And this Œ was this the first time you had gone to school, or is this Œ A: I never went to school before. Q: You never went to school. A: And I remember I was skipping, I was so happy. And in Europe you have these round places where they have advertising posted. And I remember going by there, and my mother saying, we™ll just go get our belongings from that person where we stayed for awhile. And I have no idea the duration how long we were there. And as we were passing that round thing, somebody said, Mrs. Katz? So we were turned in. We never got to the apartment. And we were marched to the police station. And at one point my mo ther says, come on Eva, sneak off, and I was frozen, I couldn™t move. And for years afterwards I was feeling that maybe if I would have moved, my mother would be alive today. From th e police station, they knew who we were, we were taken to a place called Œ a brick factory [indecipherable], which was like a holding place. Q: Mm-hm. A: And from there we were s Œ they were marching us toward Germany . You have to realize that most people had a little warn ing and had some clothes with them. We Interview with Eva Brettler November 9, 2008 13had absolutely nothing, my mother wore fa shionable shoes. And every so often they gave rides for children on, you know, those horse? Q: The carr Œ A: Carriage. Q: Right. A: You know, where they carried their Œ and every so often Œ and one day my mother ask if s-she could come, because he r feet were killing her. There were a few children on that wagon. Short time later we heard shots, and I never seen my mother again. At night when we arrived, they had like a makeshift Red Cross station where people were united. And I remember ever y time the door opened, I was listening for my mother™s steps. Never came. And I was crying. There was bombing going on around, and I just couldn™t believe it. Ho w could my mother leave me? And there was a woman who was working at that Red Cross station, and she says, until your momma comes, I take care of you. And actually, I was with her until we got to Ravensbrück. Q: Mm-hm. A: She got Œ she was half Jewish, or I don™t even know if she was half Jewish or she bra Œ did something, but they gave her a di fferent position, they didn't put her in the lager, and I was separated from her. When I arrived to Ravensbrück they took the Interview with Eva Brettler November 9, 2008 14clothes which I had on, which was very limited. And by that time the weather™s changed and it was cold, and I was freezing. They shaved my hair, and I had to go through a so-called spray where they disinfected you from Œ oh, by the way, when we Œ before we arrived to Ravensbrück, I was put in cattle cars. And I remember some people died in the cattle car. We were shoved in, that you couldn™t even move. There was no food, nothing, and it was dark, you couldn™t see. In Ravensbrück I remember going through that disinfectant area, and I came from where Œ you know, we didn™t go naked anywhere, and I was so embarrassed being nake d, and I tried to cover myself up. I didn™t have much development yet, but still, I just Œ the idea of doing Œ and I remember a woman putting a stick to me, and she said in German, put your hands on the side. Yelling at me. And even though I probably didn™t understand, but I knew what I needed to do, so I did it. And I remember kind of running between Œ it was almost like a train, you know, a stationary train, and I was walking between it because I was thinking, maybe I should just fall between it. And one of the women, she was a little older, it was almost like she read my mind. She asked my name and held me. And I kind of Œ she atta Œ she kind of adopted me. And in the barracks in Ravensbrück where I was, we were in the upper, you know, they had layers of Œ Q: Mm-hm. Interview with Eva Brettler November 9, 2008 15A: Œ cots, you know, wher e you know, like bunk beds. Q: Right. A: And we were on this mi ddle one. And I remember one morning, her arms were around me, but she wouldn™t move. And I re Œ I tried to tell her wake up, we have to get out of bed. And they se Œ some wome n must have seen what I was doing, and they said, oh my God, she died. So I laid back on her, I wanted to die, too. And the women didn™t let me, they pulled me off. I have no idea how long I was in that barrack. But I remember once hearing a baby cry. And the woman™s whisper to me, he says, you have to be Œ keep it. We have to keep this a secret. We are going to hide the mother and the ch ild. So there was actually a baby being born in the barrack where I was. And I said, oh my God, will I ever re Œ have children of my own? Will it ever happen, or Œ and all through the time when I was totally petrified, I repeated the Shema Israel over and over. I kind of went in my own private little world when I said the prayer. Q: Was it like a meditation almost? A: In a way. And I remember praying, please God, give me the opportunity. Once while we were in Ravensbrück, there were a lot of people speaking other languages. I don™t know how I communicated, I really have no recollection of that. I think mostly in Hungarian. But I seen a soldier at the w-wires, and he was with a Interview with Eva Brettler November 9, 2008 16big dog, and I was petrified of those German Shepherds. And he told me in Hungarian, come closer, and he gave me some food. And he said, if I™m here tomorrow come again, and I give you. I we nt there next day, he wasn™t, but the Russians were approaching Ravensbrück. I didn™t know about it, but the people were talking about it. And they Œ we were being collected. Some people hid. I didn™t. We were pushed again in cattle ca rs, this time directly, we weren't being marched. And I was taken from mar Œ Ravensbrück to Bergen-Belsen, excuse me. Q: Mm-hm. A: [coughing] When they opened the cattle cars, the first thing I remember seeing in Bergen-Belsen when they marched us in, were the big mountains of bodies. And I remember I just couldn™t take off my eyes from it. And there was another little girl, a little older than I, and she pulled on my hand, and her mother and I Œ her mother and her kind of adop ted me. Except the rations when we got, sometimes the mother didn't give me my ration, she took some of the rations and gave it to her daughter. Everybody in Bergen-Belsen Œ sometimes, I remember going by the area where there was a kitchen, in back of the kitchen, and they ha d potato peels backed up there. And they pushed me through, beca use I was so small. And the first few times I brought out the potato peels, ther e was nothing left for me. And I remember some people telling me, oh you saving me by giving me, and I think the idea of Interview with Eva Brettler November 9, 2008 17helping somebody really sounded good for me. I remember the third and fourth time they pushed me in, I ate first, before I brought out some potato peels. Raven Œ Ravensbrück was bad, but Bergen-Belsen was horrible. I don™t know how long I was there, but all I remember that my f Œ I was so cold my feet got frozen. And I was going to go to the hospital or clinic, whatever they had there, and the women didn™t let me go, because they said, you go in there, you won™t have a leg left. I still have a little mark on my leg where it was frozen, but my leg wasn™t amputated. When I was liberated in Bergen-Belsen by the British on April 15th, I remember getting some food from some of the soldiers. And they looked at it Œ the children in marvel. I think the food I ate, or whateve r, I became so sick, very soon afterwards. And while I was in Œ actually, it was, I didn™t get sick right away, it was like a f Œ little while later, because I remember meeting that Mrs. Gross who rented u-us the room. And she told me Eva, come on, I take you back . And I told her, I™m not going back to Budapest, to Hungary. I™m sure my mother is dead, otherwise she would have come and got me during this time. And probably my father was killed, too. I said, I™m going to live in the King™s castle in Sweden. I heard about the woman who took care of orphans in Bergen-Belsen. People were whispering about it, and heard Œ I Œ all I heard was that her name is Luba(ph). And I wanted someone to take care of me. I wanted to be togeth er with other orphan children. And I said, Interview with Eva Brettler November 9, 2008 18I™m sure I™d be able to go to Sweden. And I don™t remember the process going through, how I ended up. Bu t before I ended up going to Sweden, I was in a ho Œ for a long time in a hospital because I was so sick with typhus. And there was a British doctor who really liked me. And he says, my wife and I don™t have any children, we™d like to adopt you. And I told him the same thing what I told Mrs. Gross, I want to live in the King™s castle. I had it so bad. I w Œ I want some servants, and I want people to take care of me. Well, I Œ just before I went on the boat to Sweden, I met the young girl who I connected in Bergen-Belsen, and her mother died. She apologized to me. And she hugged me and kissed me, she says, I™m sorry if we Œ any way you were hurt. And on the boat going over to Sweden, I remember there was another Hungarian gi rl who had the sister who was Œ he couldn™t speak Œ deaf. Q: Deaf. A: And after the first time I was interviewe d, she actually got in contact with me because it Œ her husband worked at Yale. Q: Mm-hm. A: And my late husband became very sick and I never really connected with her, so this is something I™m Œ still have to do one of these days. So I ended up in Sweden. I don™t know exactly when I went. And I was in a orphanage, first time. We didn™t Interview with Eva Brettler November 9, 2008 19have no more schooling, but I started to lear n. And we were bei ng prepared to go to Israel. First time I was told I™m worth something, I™m special, I can do things. Look at, you survived, and you will be a soldier in Israel and you will help us build Israel. And I remember having campfires and singing and really had a wonderful comradeship, you know, with other children. I r Œ I remember being Œ going on the Œ you know, the slides, you know sa Œ i-in the snow? Q: Mm-hm. A: And just doing everything, you know, as a [indecipherable] so for me that was very special, I liked it there. Q: And you got to be a child in a w Œ in a wa Œ in a way that you weren™t able to. A: I was Œ I wasn™t for quite some time. And then I Œ I remember Œ and I connected with Luba(ph) there. Q: Mm-hm. A: I forgot to mention something, that I had the ring. And I kept that ring all through the camps under my tongue. Because that was Œ I felt if I survived, that™s the only way they™d be able to recognize me, because I changed so much. Q: Right. A: And while I was in Sweden, my Œ the ring became small on my finger, and I moved it to my little finger. And it slipped off, and it went down the drain. And that Interview with Eva Brettler November 9, 2008 20Luba(ph) was holding me for hours, and said, Eva Œ she didn™t speak Hungarian, so by that time I spoke Polish. Q: Mm-hm. A: She says, Eva, the ring is not who you are. Your mother will be always in your heart. And that was the end of my ring, but I had that very close connection with Luba(ph), and I talked about her many times. And when I was Œ okay, I get back to that. One day I™m being called that my father is alive, and he wants me to go back. And I think I had the telephone convers ation with my father. Somehow they arranged it, and I remember telling my fa ther, the only way I come home, if you promise you won™t argue any more, and you won™t play too much cards. Naturally, my father promised. And I must have spoken to him in German, because we were educated in German. And in 1947, January, I went back to Hungary . And I didn™t know how to speak Hungarian, because Œ it wa sn™t that long time, but apparently a child forgets easily, and learns. Q: Right. A: And by that time I™m 10 years, I just turned 10. And they enrolled me to a religious school. My father remarried, I had a new mother, and a new brother. And while chronologically I was 10, I survived for a few years by the wit, and a certain street smartness. And when somebody told me no, I wanted to know the reason Interview with Eva Brettler November 9, 2008 21behind it, when I came back. And my fath er said, what happened to you, it was horrible, but we are not going to talk about it. We want you to be, quote unquote, a normal child. And you will call your norm Œ new mother as mother, because she™s going to raise you, and you have a little br other. He was six months old when I came home. And you will go to school. They hired a tu tor who Œ who was teaching me how to speak again Hungarian. Can we stop a minute? Q: Mm-hm. [break] This is a continuation of the interview with Eva Brettler. Now you Œ your father came back from Œ for you, and you went back to Budapest, and you had a new mother and a new little brothe r. Did it surprise you that your father had remarried already? Cause it Œ there wasn™t a long time Œ A: I was shocked. It was very short duration, yeah. Q: Mm-hm. A: And actually there™s some family disagr eement about that, because some of my aunts, my father™s sister, said, how do you know she is dead? And then he said that he was told that she is dead. It happened more often. I Œ my father was the type of person who needed someone, and she Œ my stepmother, in many ways was good for him. She was a strict woman and everything , and she lost her first husband also, in the Holocaust, so there was something. And my father, when he wanted something, he went after her Œ and, very handsome man. And he had Œ she had difficulty and Interview with Eva Brettler November 9, 2008 22she was alone, and a lot of people connected after the war. And they got married in March ™45, and my brother wa s born in ™46, so you Œ you know. So it was little after a year. I brought up something when I was interviewed in 1982, I went and asked certain questions of my father, he was still alive. And my stepmother said, you stinker. You were so angry at me, you refuse d to talk to me. And I told her, Mama, I didn't speak the language. All these year s she was under the impression that I was angry at her, and that™s why I didn't sp eak the language. I could speak with my father, my father spoke fluently Yiddish , and if you spoke German, Yiddish was understandable. It was, in a way, typical. She is a very strong woman, and unfortunately my brother is not doing as well as he could be doing in life. And partially had to do with maybe my father being a little too giving in to her needs. And I felt a little bit deserted by him. And mostly I felt deserted because I couldn™t talk about her. And a couple of times I approached him to talk about my mother, and he refused to tell me anything. So, wh atever I found out about my mother was much later, when I connected with my mother™s sister, who survived. Her name is Œ was Blanca . And also with my aunts and uncle through my father™s side. So, I didn™t have an easy childhood. Q: Right. Interview with Eva Brettler November 9, 2008 23A: I came home, my father at that time wa s running a grocery store. And before that he had some black marketing ways of doi ng things. I think for awhile they called him the salt king, because he went to Romania , brought back salt, and there was no salt in Budapest. Q: Right. A: So, he had all kinds of ins and outs. Q: Mm-hm. A: And so he, you know Œ and I helped out occasionally, deliver things, you know, from the grocery store, until the communist government took over things. I ended up going to a Jewish school, a Orthodox school. And the first day I went to school I was taken to the principal office, the princi pal introduced me to my teacher, and the teacher had to go to the bathroom and he said something to me to go into the classroom. I misunderstood him, and I wa lked into a boys™ classroom, and they were saying the mor Œ you know, the morning prayer, the Modeh Ani. And I hang up my coat, and I hang up my backpack and I see everybody staring at me, feel kind of awkward. And the teacher ask me in Hungarian Œ I understood Hungarian, I just couldn't speak it Œ and the Œ he ask me, wh at are you doing here? And I said Œ the teacher told me to come in. He says, you are on the wrong floor, you have to go a floor above. Well, all of a sudden everyb ody heard somebody speaking German. So Interview with Eva Brettler November 9, 2008 24I was nicknamed for awhile, the Kraut, which you can imagine how delicious that felt. But all of a sudden, people heard about me. There weren™t too many children that came back. And from early on I kind of took on certain Œ I don™t want to say leadership, but I was independent, okay? Q: Mm-hm. A: And I spoke up, like I mentioned before , I questioned things. And people found out that I came back from the camps, and suddenly there were a lot of people coming to our home. And I remember peop le coming with pictures, wanting to know if I remember seeing some of their relatives, and so on. I™m 10 years old. Q: [indecipherable] right. A: So as a 10 year old, I kind of adapted to the situation, and I remember crying and telling them, I™m sorry, I don™t remember. And I promised to write. I don™t know how I even could promise [indecipherable]. And I remember somebody said, I™ll give you the money to write. I said, give me the money after you get the answer, or something to that nature. Going back Œ an d we had a grocery store, and I remember once getting a basket of like, those light biscuits. Q: Mm-hm. A: You have to remember, I lived in a place where sweets and things like that, I obviously had a sweet tooth, were limited. So I decided to have one, then another Interview with Eva Brettler November 9, 2008 25one. By the time I took it home, the box of biscuits were gone. And I couldn™t live it down.

In order to go, you had to go through a preparation class, and I did that. And I did exceptionally well, I had good math skills and so on. And they accepted me to school.

And she could put up with my Papa, which wasn ™t the easiest thing those days. It™s kind of sad because when my father became si ck he totally withdrawn. He was making jokes and everything, and when he got sick he became withdrawn, he didn™t go to the shul any more. He used to go every morning, you know, to daven, you know what that means. Yeah.

And I, if I can help somebody, I like the idea of helping, and through the Child Survivor organization, I made friends, which is a combination of friends and relatives. I Œ to some extent they are maybe closer than you can be to some relatives, because you can talk about the pains and everything. And nonjudgmental. Q: Do you find that a lot? Do you find that Œ that peop le judge you because you did survive, or Œ have you experienced that before? A: Oh yes. My poor stepmother™s mother, her son Shlymie(ph) was killed, and he was apparently a saint. I never knew him. And she told me. Not once, not twice. Interview with Eva Brettler November 9, 2008 50And then she apologized, you know. But she personally to ld me, and I have been told, you know. We went to conference, I will never forget, the guy wasn™t aware that I was in camp. He said, what do you know, you were just a child, and you were not even in the camps. Or, you were Hungarian, you were a shorter length of time. So, you know, they don™t even know, but they look at y ou as a child, and you know, you were a child, how would you know what suffering really was? Q: Right. A: I mean, suffering was pretty crucial. I mean, there was a time I had clothes, in Bergen-Belsen I remember I put something under my hat that Œ and I slept on it, that you know, I was together with Gyps ies, couldn™t get away from Gypsies. So, there were Gypsies in the same barrack where I was. And in the morning, it was gone. And I remember putting some kind of a blank Œ it wasn™t a blanket, but something like it, around me. And when I had to stand achtung , you know, the line-up, the woman throwed it off from me, the same way, you know, with that stick. When I see those sticks it scares the daylight out of me. And for a long time I was petrified of darks, too. So it Œ it was really Œ I mean, I listened to some older survivor describe and it Œ flashes come ba ck to you. You know, things which you think you forgot, and then kind of ha Œ I go to sleep and all of a sudden I Œ I see Interview with Eva Brettler November 9, 2008 51certain things which I didn™t realize that they were Œ some were stored in the memory, they laying. And it Œ they come forward. Q: Yeah. A: And like, recently, just in Œ I think it was in June, I was involved in the Bearing Witness program with UCLA, did you hear about it? Q: Mm-hm. A: And I was matched up with a young ma n who comes from a Iranian background, I think he was born here alre ady. And we had like three or four sessions together. We met for lunch, and Œ and I remember when I told him how old I was in Bergen-Belsen, he went in almost like a state of shock. And I remember touching him and holding him. His Œ I said, I™m here. And he just couldn™t Œ what did you do all day, was his a Œ a question. How could you be here? So I realized it™s Œ even for me, when I look at my grandkids, it™s hard to believe that a person at that age, I don™t know. God forbid nobody should be tested on it. And I Œ when last year I came back from Israel, I went to visit my daughter, because my granddaughter™s birthday is November 15 th. So I came back two days later, I flew to Seattle. And I looked on my granddaughter, she just turned eight. And I realized I was in the camp, I probably didn™t even know what day it was. Q: Mm-hm. Interview with Eva Brettler November 9, 2008 52A: And tears got into my eyes and I started to cry. And my daughter and I went a little later on a ride, and she says, Mom, I can™t handle it. I can™t handle the idea of knowing what pain you went through, and I can™t handle you associating it with my daughter. So I heard it. Q: Mm-hm. A: And I Œ I™m respecting it, and I Œ I make a point of not bringing it up. Q: Right. A: But my other daughters Œ my story was written up re-recently in the L.A. Jewish Journal. It was about four or five people were in the Indestructible Spirit project, I don™t know if you heard about it. Q: I haven™t heard about that, but you seem like a good subject for that. A: Well, and they quote me Œ they took a picture of my youngest grandson and I. Bill Aron, did you hear of Bill Aron? Q: Mm-hm. A: He™s a very well known photographer an d he Œ he took pictures of quite a few survivors. And there was a write-up, you know, somebody interviewed me, and er Œ and the story about the potato peels was wr itten on. And with my grandson, I am holding my grandson. And my 10 Œ 12 year old grandson was reading it. That™s my Grandma. So, in a way he Œ yeah. Interview with Eva Brettler November 9, 2008 53Q: Mm-hm. A: You know, there are stories which happe ned, and cruelty which happened, some of them I probably still cannot talk about. And maybe they are better Œ Q: Left unsaid, yeah. A: Œ not to be said. I have memories of st ed Œ trying to find a solid surface to put my head against it, to kill the lice which were biting. I mean, it was so painful. I mean, how can you da Œ talk about things of that nature? It happened. And then I remember about my feet when it was frozen, and it was painful. And people, total strangers who never knew me, were holding onto me so I don™t go into there and don™t have my feet amputated, or probably killed. So cruelty still happens today, and injustice still happens today, and probably the reason I started to speak now, and I wanted to give my oral in Œ interview to you, because if we can stop only one person Œ and that particular young man I mentioned to you I met through UCLA, he said it was one of the most meaningful experience I had til now in my life, he says, seeing you at UCLA, he says, to me, to meet a survivor and to see where you are today. So, you hear my reason for being here. Q: I do, and I appreciate your time and I appreciate Œ A: Thank you, and I felt Œ Q: Œ your strength. Interview with Eva Brettler November 9, 2008 54A: Œ a very strong bond with you, I don™t know why. You have the face, you could be one of my Œ you are too young to be my child, maybe a grandchild, not quite. Q: Well, thank you so much. A: Thank you. Q: This Œ this concludes our interview with Eva Brettler. Conclusion of Interview
