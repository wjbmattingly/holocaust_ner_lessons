Wes, can you start off by telling me your name at birth. n this years obviously before World War Two in a small Polish town which was about half and half, Polish , one of the most important things to know about this one can imagine. There are no recorded incidents of any conflicts between these two religions in that small town. And the town was located about 20 miles southeast of Warsaw. My mother . My father was born in nearby and lived most of his adult life in that, in to wn, or in concentration camps or in western Poland where he resettled. Q: What year were you r parents born? Poland regained its independence was called Gali cia which was part of the Austro -Hungarian years. And when it regained indep parts Œ Prussian on the west, Russia on the east, and Austro-Hungarian Empire on the south, which included Galicia. Q: How did your parents meet? Interview with Wies 4 August 15, 2018 . My mother was a teacher in nearby village. And my father at that time was working in the post office. My father was a bachelor at that time and he had great ease of communication with ave beautiful picture My father was an accountant. He worked in the bank for some time and also in post office. And my mother was grammar school teacher. She was really gifted and praised by many paren communicate with children and motivate children. So my first memories were started with the age about three. When my father was assigned a job, ing Polish cities and they attacking Poland from the west, Warsaw was attacked relatively early by bombers. And although there was only 20 miles between Warsaw and Gó ra Kalwaria, German bombers apparently made mistake and they were looking for military objects. They bombed the residential part of our town, although there were military barracks on the other end of the town. They were all made of bricks, covered with the yellow shingles made of clay. An d from the air made a mistake and they dropped several bombs and one of them landed very near of my house where family of 11 people, escapees from Warsaw were hiding in. The escapees from Warsaw when they thought, they saved their lives by running from Warsaw. However, German bomb dropped on that house killed all of them, ten of them were killed. Only one person was saved. Q: Before we get too far into your memories of the war and the beginning of the war, can you tell me more about your family background. Your father™s family and where they came from as well as your mother™s. Interview with Wies 5 August 15, 2018 A: So starting with my father, my father™s family was -- it™s a long history cause one of my uncles was keeping the history of our family. Unfortunately this book which was, hand written th century, one of our a ncestors, he was a general, , as a commander of old town which had the medieval walls around it. And then Q: The moat. A: The moat. And this structure survived for several centuries, defending east ern territories of Poland against the invasions of Tartars and other armies which were trying to conquer Europe from east. Q: Was it in Góra Kalwaria also? Or outside? A: No, Góra Kalwaria was more to the west. On Vistula river . Gó ra Kalwaria was in e ast located on the western shore of Vistula river which was the main river in Poland, running from almost the border with Czech republic and now was Czechoslovakia at that time to Baltic sea. Q: S o where did this ancestor live? A: They, some of them they lived in this area. Others lived in, which is called Ukraine and my Postalistichi Novy its man and he learned Russian quickly. He changed his physiognomy by starting a beard, side burns and hair style and acquire false documents and he run away from this camp. And then was traveling mostly by foot. Sometimes working as a handyman on the way to earn some money for Interview with Wies 6 August 15, 2018 food. But it took him 11 and a half months by foot to get from Siberia back to the area which he lived near Warsaw. Meanwhile, all his property including quite an amount of land was confiscated by Russians so he had to start his life from square one. He managed to have two children, a boy and girl which were raised by somebody else because he became ill and he died ver and one of the Œ pardon me. Q: What was his name? A: His name was Saldwan grandfather was Karl and the one which is at the ceme tery Œ will recall it, during this conversation. So Œ Q: Does your mother™s family have a colorful past just like that? medium kind of the level they had their own coat of arms and everything was recorded and my uncle was keeping these records which unfortunately were destroyed. On my mother™s side. My mother came Œ my mother was raised on a small farm in the er was born he was the oldest. He had three sisters. My mother had one sister and four brothers. And there were two or three who died because of the illnesses of the time and bad medical care obviously. So it was especially from the distance of time. traveling betwee n Warsaw and Góra Kalwaria often , and trading with different items. One of the most important items he was trading was golden coins because those who know life in Poland, during the occupation they would know that everybody was trading, even children. The re was either barter or cash. Everybody knew value of everything else. All was illegal. Germans absolutely didn™t allow trading unless it was s anctioned by them, by stores which they would Interview with Wies 7 August 15, 2018 approve and you have to be either confident or some other, doing some other functions, useful for Germans. Or the trades was illegal. And, but everybody was really smuggling to survive. couldn™t enter the store and buy what you wanted. So m y mother was an early Œ when my father was traveling between Warsaw and Góra Kalwaria, my mother was very involved in social movements . My mother was involved in the trade union, the labor union, teachers labor union. She was were demonstrations for higher salaries, for better working conditions and so on. Partially successful. During the war my mother relatively quickly joined underground movement which was led by P prowestern, it was called Armia [ph] in English. Actually it was AK in English was national army. Yes. Q: Can you tell me about your mother™s occupation as a teacher, what she taught and her role with in the community? teaching all basic things. Usually teachers on that level they didn™t have specialty so she was teaching history, geography, Polish language , less sciences . However, during the war, Germans -- it was very lucky that in our town there were somehow more liberal. And we had two schools and each was Œ different parts of Poland, t hey were allow, the classes were only from one to four. And obviously they would allow teaching history, geography, anything which would enlighten people. They want ed Poles to just read and write and do the basic calculus. They didn™t, the all middle schools, all universities were all forbidden. However, there was a lot of underground schooling. There were regular classes in people™s houses. Some of them denounced, pe ople were arrested. Torture sometimes. There were all kind of sanctions, but many, many of the schools because of the solidarity between the people. Everybody was interested having the children educated in spite of German restrictions. Most of the school were all different levels. Diplomas were -- and people were chipping in, in different ways. Interview with Wies 8 August 15, 2018 Œ ving tutorials after the regular school hours. There were, different kids are coming different days, different hours to my house there were either less talented or t hey had harder conditions at home. Parents which are uneducated and they couldn™t help them with homework. So my mother was fulfilling that role. homemade bread, eggs, carrots, onions, chickens sometime which was already plucked and ready to cook for soup or whatever. So we are relatively, relatively and there were periods of time when there was shortage of food, where there were no tutorials and they depended on detention and what was happening outside where, especially at the beginning of the war and just before the end of war, when they were first ere major upheaval for the Warsaw and the near surroundings where we lived. Q: Kind of the beginning of the war, do you remember hearing about the war, hearing about the tensions between the Germans on the radio or the rise of anti -Semitism in Germany? A: We™re not allowed to have radios. Q: Before the war? A: Bef ore war, yes. Oh you™re talking about before war. Q: Yeah did you have any sense that a war was coming before September first? A: Yes and no. There was some talks but most of the population were kept in the belief and that included ean all citizens was considered a, such a possibility, French and English are going to attack from the west because there were international agreements signed between the governments who were the western powers declare that if the Poland is attacked they are going to attack as well. Interview with Wies 9 August 15, 2018 However, what we learned later and obviously Hitler and his intelligence services had very good earned was front and there were absolutely vulnerable from the west. And Poles, Polish army and civilians were defending Warsaw for several weeks. Warsaw was encircled by German army but there were organized resistance. There was some w, ammunition and arms to protect Warsaw against the German army and it was very harrowing defense. However Germans had superiority in the air. They were bombing and they had superior tanks so in spite of the barricades and all these fortifications which were built around the outskirts, on the outskirts of, of center of the city, was conquered after several weeks. Q: What was the response from your parents when the war began? Was there any talk about fleeing the area and going elsewhere? A: Yes, it™s very good question because what happened here. After the first bombs were dropped on Góra Kalwaria, there was real -- start to be just somewhere else. Germans are attacking them. They come here eventually or maybe Polish army would defend them. Maybe French and Germans would attack from the west. The whole resistance was hinging on that promise cause otherwise Polan d realized it, its population realized that they didn™t have any chance because the Germans who had huge amount of the very well, well trained, well equipped, quite modern arms, artillery, airplanes and so on. And so what happens here that my parents at the very beginning, after the first bombing, ple in that group, plus the owner of the big truck, Mr. Victor was his name. We packed our belongings within hours. Packed our belongings on the top of the truck and we are running towards Russia to escape Germans. On the roads and roads were narrow, whole traffic was mostly towards east. And there were columns and columns. Sometime trucks which were rarity. Small cars also rarity. Mostly was carts pulled by horses and people loading their belongings and there were columns as long as you can reach by eyesight. What German fire, the planes were doing. They were running along, flying along these roads and from the machine guns and also small bombs they were dropping on these convoys. So whatever it would have and we could distinguish between Polish aircraft and Interview with Wies 10 August 15, 2018 German aircraft. There was something different . And my task on the top of the truck was to look to the west and watch and listen for the so bringing attention of the adults and then what people were doing, they running quickly to the left and the right side leaving truck in the center of the road. And they were hiding in between the potato or rye or wheat you know whatever we could Œ or trees if it was nearby. And we™re sitting there waiting until they go away because they came for a couple of minutes and they were gone and then nothing regular or they are not Œ unpredictable. This way we reached Russian borders which was Soviet Union at that time but we called it Russian. And since Russians enter Poland from the east on were at that time in Russia already, not d eep. And we are ordered to go back towards west, towards Poland itself w hich was still Poland but it was already occupied by Russians that territory. And not many people know that the Russia took re that. However the population density was much higher in the western territories which were eastern territories. Also eastern territories had much more minorities and so and Russia started to resettle Poles to Siberia, or to west, Kazakhstan , towards Siberia. They had to, were less organized than German but they had trains which were equipped with pig, with cars adapted to transport pigs. There were no passenger cars. And they were sent to which they later was called Kulaks, gulags. Q: During this eva cuation and when you were listening out for the airplanes coming, do you ? Œ mean? Q: Did you comprehend it? A: How, you know what™s a child™s reaction when he sees front of the plane going towards you and kind of the almost aiming at you and they were coming very low sometime so when they™re coming low we are definitely out of truck already, but was very, very scar which you cannot forget til the end of your life. Interview with Wies 11 August 15, 2018 Q: Do you remember what your parents told you? Do you remember them communicating with you at this time? A: They were scared by themselves so you know this is the time when children mature much faster than their chronological calendars. During the war my father was already in Auschwitz. My mother was part of this underground movement and during the day quite often when she was at work, my house looked normal. There was nothing unusual but on occasion, once every week, every two weeks on an irregular basis, we have a crew coming to our house. Crew, and those are the members of the same underground movement which my mother belonged and they were coming wi th the radio transmitter, receiver in pieces. Some of the pieces were hidden in our house. Some of -- they were bringing and putting together in minutes literally and they are starting communication by Morse code with radio base which was located on the And they are communicating forth and back, sending information which is coded also besides the Morse code. They were also using some coded, so it was not easy. However, Germans knew about these stations , they couldn™t easily find them because they are villages, small towns. They couldn™t be everywhere all the time so my task was that as soon as who were fulfilling similar role, although some time they were, didn™t know all the details, because we didn™t talk among our self, all the details for obvious reasons. And was to look for the German, they look like a pick-up truck today, but it was a low truck, small truck, which dipole antenna which, the antenna which allows to determine from which direction signal is coming, from that station. So to determine wh ere location of that station, of the transmitter, they had to have two measurements from different angles. And then on the map they could identify very So my task and my friends™ task was to my mother one to another one w ere standing on the corners of the streets. So within seconds my mother knew there is a truck nearby. And my mother was running inside of our house and telling the cre w. They were taking apart that radio station, hiding whatever they could, take the rest of Interview with Wies 12 August 15, 2018 them and they obviously they are not running around the streets. They are going in the back of our house, through the orchards. Orchard to orchard. Orchard to orchard, never going through the town itself, but on the outskirts, through the dense whatever the forest and usually there were where the concentration German where police headquarters. When they come into town they knew where to go and not to go. Q: How many times do you remember seeing a truck and having to warn your mother that it was coming? A: Fortunately, not even once we detected this truck at the time when a radio station Œ saw these trucks but at that time there was never that station in my house. So we were lucky. This same crew which came to us several times, we learned they were shot when they were jumping through, were escaping and they were machine gunned. They were decimated, al l of them, two or three were coming to our house when another crew was coming. But they were detected and killed in some neighboring small town. A: Yes, they were going from town to town through different p laces on irregular basis, unpredictable for anybody else but they have their own system will allow them to coordinate with the house owner and having this system of people one case the system failed obviously and they were killed. A: Yes there was, my mom was very friendly with the principal of the school at which she was teaching and his wife was teacher as well. And this lady, she was the head of that women™s division in support of other girl fighters cause my mom didn™t have, she didn™t train. She knew how to shoot but she was not really specially trained. And there was not a role for the women . There was mostly role for men. The women had a lot of supportive roles. One of them, for Interview with Wies 13 August 15, 2018 mother. Be cause as By average, her classes ™t say closest cheder they sent them to the public schools, to the Polish because they were doing business. m was involved and at the very beginning there was a lot of smuggling going between Warsaw which was the biggest center where you could get food. Or from countryside farms, to the ghetto in Góra Kalwaria. Ghetto in Góra Kalwaria was very unusual because it did have sections with the barbed wire fences. However specially during the night, the traffic was unbelievable. That somehow people were able to bribe the guards which were part of Judenrat organization which was set up to communicate between Germans and -civilian dressed but during the night was friend who had the, his house windows were looking at the ghetto fence. Q: What streets was the ghetto on? A: Pia r w Œ a good friend of my mother is a gentleman who died recently. His name was Henrik Price . Here is article about Holocaust Museum which you sent to me, the -- you are there, and his, the general™s name is . n™t be able to non were not allowed to enter. Interview with Wies 14 August 15, 2018 Q: Can you tell me more about your mother™s involvement in the underground movement and some of the tasks that she was given to do? A: So one of the tasks my mother took and also she was assigned later officially by the underground movement was to find people who would be actively involved in smuggling food to ghetto, either from country side by her knowledge of the farmers who were parents of the children which she was teaching at the school. Or people who were traveling regularly or willing to travel to Warsaw and bring some items which were not regularly av ailable locally. And there is too many names to mention here, but they are peo ple still alive, my peers or people Avram Henrik Price. There are You Tubes, they ar was -- a half. Unbelievably strong physically and mentally. He describes his life in great details and there is so much to be learned about his life and the life of other people. Q: So your mother worked with him? A: My mother worked with him after the war in different organizations. But my mother knew him and he knew both my parents because war. He knew my father quite well. So Œ Q: Did your mother ever go to the ghetto when she was trying to get food into the ghetto from all these famers? non were restricted. They couldn™t, they were not allowed to enter. So but, through mutual friends and mutual acquaintances there was quite good communication and again, in spite of German regulations, peopl mean people are working in ghetto. People are trying to preserve food, to sell items. Everybody believed in the ghetto that this just, just temporary solution, that they would be resettled in a Interview with Wies 15 August 15, 2018 different pla ce. They would be saved from Œ people didn™t want to admit that this is any of kind of the organized massacre and they are going to be killed. Everybody had hope and as you well known th at kept peo ple going and l iving because once you remove the hope from human beings, the whole life doesn™t make sense. So obviously there were moments when people becoming depressed or they stop to be positive and optimistic, but there was role of others to keep the spirit alive and so there were all kind of preoccupations, including small theater, singing groups, educational aspects, organizations were getting together and having discussions. Q: Outside the ghetto or inside? the ghetto and unbelievable overcrowding. People were living eight H . Q: So they were friends of yours who were in the ghetto? A: Those are the people who were able to escape, hide and they were able to survive and they who lived in prewar Poland, that™s were people who were able to Œ Q: Did you have friends who were in the ghetto? A: Not in my age and not my classmates. But they were like friends of my friends. A lot of because of my parents™ acquaintance being there. Or there™s very interesting story. My, one of my three or four best friends -- they live in this, closer to center of town. And they had a house with several rooms. My friends and his last name is . Q: How do you spell that? Interview with Wies 16 August 15, 2018 A: P -T-A-K which in translation means a belt, a belt. Q: And his first name was? A: His name is Witold, W --T-OAnd one of the ba rsht which is like made of it™s like a sourdough bread which is added some aging, you know like you make kefir. Ferment. Went through the process of fermentation. So to get the essence of that was coming to their house and bringing empty bo was like a broth for making a soup. Potato was added and one of my (part of our?) when my was preparing dinner. And my mother and Œ quite often and either dinner was ready or not much left to finish the dinner. So this, my friend™s uncle which was brother of his mother™s, mother™s brother. He fell in love beginning of ghetto when she was surrounded and she was forced to resettle and live in that ghetto, she escaped, like a lot of p eople did. But not high percentage. And she, and it was interesting that peo ple who were escaping from ghetto, they either tried to be in countryside which was easier to hide. with a farmer like this gentleman, Henrik Price. He was adopted. He got the false document and he was adopted by a family of farmers who had son of similar age who didn™t return from war. He was part of the Polish army and he didn™t return. And this family adopted Mr. Price. And Œ Q: What happened to the uncle™s girlfriend? A: She, when she escaped from G óra Kalwaria, she went to another ghetto in a small town on the other side of the Vistula river. There was no bridge so you have to be, there was some special people who for a fee they took you in a small boat, one p, two persons, three people that could fit on that ferry so it was just b asically like a major canoe. And a long stick and that™s the way they got on the other side of the river. The river was quite substantial and you could get in troubles if you tried to swim across. Anyhow so she went to another ghetto which was much more l iberal so Interview with Wies 17 August 15, 2018 to speak , much easy to get in and out and so on. And then again she escaped from there because he was able, he was working at the cemeteries of smaller towns and he found on the grave a name of the Polish woman and her name was Yanina , fitting t he age. He went to the priest and And she was under that name til they got married, this couple but meanwhile there was not the end of this story. Meanwhile she was sent under the fals non. They were sent to Germany to work on the farms because Germans were short of manual, menial workers. And so a lot of Poles, depending on the historian, but their calculation at least one million Poles worked on the farms in Germany during the war and were obviously all forced. They were paid a little bit, tiny bit, given food and shelter and many of them survive. And to the , they loved her so much that they were b eing order ed. They wanted to give the bakery to her. H owever she didn™t want to stay in Germany. She returned after the war to Gó ra Kalwaria and she married my friend™s uncle. Her name is Salome, or they cal led her, her real name and again for got her real last name. But they had two children. They have children again and my friend was baptizing. You know he was Œ Q: The godfather? olika. Q: Were a lot of people in your town sent to work in Germany? A: Surprising met her husband who came from Belgium. He was of Polish descent. She was of Polish descent from Poland. They married and they settled in Belgium. Not from our town. Somehow there were many , many others who went and they return. A lot of people in our town wouldn™t say majority, definitely not. But in my family one of my cousins was, Interview with Wies 18 August 15, 2018 most of the German occupation he was just hiding . He was not at home because if he showed at home he would be either denounced or he would be sought by police and he would be arrested. Q: Why? A: Because they had records. Either they beat somebody, so me German and they runaway and the police knew who was he, came home. He was gone. So luckily they -- nobody got, the Germans didn™t care the other members of the family but he was gone and he stayed alive. He is something. Q: What™s his name? A: His name is Dietsich . He was kin to my grand pa. My grandma was Kr alewska from her maiden name before she got married. Q: Spell his last name. A: Kralewska, K -R-A-E-W-S-K-A. Kralewska. Zuzanna, Z-U-Z-A-N-NA. Q: So that was your grandmother was Œ A: Grandmother or my father™s mother. Q: We haven™t talked about your father very much. A: That™s right so my father was arrested in Warsaw. And miraculously. Q: Befo during the b eginning of the war? A: He was traveling between Warsaw and Góra Kalwaria but then more and more he was staying Interview with Wies 19 August 15, 2018 in Warsaw because his -- what trading he was doing involved presence of big like a farmer™s market in Warsaw. Góra Kalwaria had farmer™s market when farmers were coming once a week with their horse pulled, horse pulled cart full of goods which they grew. Warsaw had market but there was less farmer s but more middle men and women and who could get a lot of interesting things there. N ot everything certain things which are shown and other things which were kind of behind counter or underneath. Only when you struck a conversation and since people got familiar with you they had some level of trust. Then they tell you, you know Q: Contraband materials or black market kind of? A: Definitely materials which Germans di dn™t allow, including cold cuts. Unfortunately there were not refrigeration so you can imagine have to be fresh and salt. They couldn™t take them outside, so by the end of day they were selling for less and less and less. Also you could bargain. You could Œ Q: Barter? -eastern markets if the sale person sells at nominal price, they are not fully satisfied, although they got fully amount of money. Q: Haggle. A: Haggle is the word. You need to haggle and the more you haggle you know one another better. And that is a satisfaction for both sides involved. There is more pleasant feeling about the transaction you are asked for, it™s kind of you don™t get much respect from the salesperson. That™s the psychology of specially small town and you know village. Q: So your father was acting as kind of one of these middle people? Interview with Wies 20 August 15, 2018 A: He was middle people because he didn™t produce anything. He was buying and selling but you need to know where to buy and what price and to know where to go and sell. And you buy through your own tr usted channels and you sell where it™s a lot of people when you again establish certain re lationship. You sell certain items to strangers maybe most of them but you have your own customers who know you, come and you are always standing in the same place so -- or the same area and peo ple recognize one another and they wa ve and then they go som etimes to the site. They don™t do transaction with everybody is looking at their hands. So the whole culture. Q: That™s kind of an occupational shift for your father, right? A: Absolutely. Q: He was an accountant. Why did he switch? A: Because the p ay, pay couldn™t get job at the very beginning. Pay was poor and you could be -- think k from a lady. And there could have been some relationship there which he was obviously hiding from my mother. My mother -- women have this instinct and can sense; however we didn™t have proof. Q: This was in Warsaw? arrested barely anybody in our small town knew. Only that he was arrested, only because he was not often coming to Góra Kalwaria. So he was not coming for longer time. He was arrested , sent to Auschwitz and people didn™t know about that . Only closest trusted people knew about that . We didn™t broadcast it, we didn™t spread that information. Obviously his mother, his sisters knew about that. And they again didn™t talk to anybody about it. Because there was nobody™s interest to talk about that. Was too many Interview with Wies 21 August 15, 2018 questions. People were asking so, and so and so on. Avoid unnecessary lying or making stories people rather avoiding subject. Q: Why was he arrested? A: That™s a big mystery, which is mystery to me til do not have hundred percent proof but the hypothesis which were my mother™s hypothesis and since my father would get the -- from the first hand. Q: And your father wouldn™t tell you? father is divorced so my father changed the location. He moved to so called regained territories from Germany. He started a new f amily in Yeren Yagoda mother died in my home, United States. My father died in didn™t maintain the relationship with his new family. Q: He was sent to Auschwitz immediately or was he sent and Œ A: First he was tortured in Warsaw special headquarters whe re they specialized in torturing prisoners to get the information about the coworkers, what he knew about underground movement. They didn™t learn much because he didn™t know much. The underground movement in Góra Kalwaria didn™t accept my father. He didn™t apply for it and my mother would be, wouldn™t agree for that because he was traveling a lot and he was talkative and he might not keep the secrets. The underground movement, most of the peo ple who were members they knew only pseudonyms of one another, unless they knew them self from before. Interview with Wies 22 August 15, 2018 But that was rather recommended that to work together with people whom you didn™t know before and used pseudonyms which were different arrested, you are beaten tortured, you couldn™t say if you didn™t know. Q: Did your mother have a pseudonym? historian who wrote a book Heroes of Two Towns and he describes especially one, one it™s in Polish, Bohaterodia Dvu Myastits [ph] in Polish in the original . And yes, she did and so after the removal of the ghetto from Góra Kalwaria, as you can imagine a lot of real estate left there. Three thousand people were crowded but it was a lot of empty housing, which Germans didn™t care because they were not special ly high quality housing. They are not office buildings. They did confiscate my school and they keeping their hospital, they keeping for certain t ime school for German children, families. German officials who were in town. And then there was in a hospital vividly remember they were getting off the train and they walked through the town and how they were wrapped around up to sometimes barely their noses that were sticking from the bandages arou nd. There were people who were the soldiers who were returning from Stalingrad when Germans were, Russians defended them self and then was part of the Œ from the defense mode they started to press. And there was full winter. Germans absolutely unprepared to survive Russian, Siberian type of the weather. And many of them they lost parts of the body, noses, ears. They were all wrapped around when they were coming for reconv alison hospital there when they were staying for a couple of months and they were going back to Germany because they were not, many of them were not capable to fight any more. And they had huge shortage of manpower by the end of the year. Q: There were German families living in Góra Kalwaria? A: Yes, but they were all i mplants . There were few German families who are native and they, most often they were, cooperation. They knew German language and they are cooperating with authorities and, but Polish underground movement™s task was to watch, mon itor and eventually Interview with Wies 23 August 15, 2018 underground movement. And there was one incident when in the school whe re one boy came and he was crying, saying that Germans ki lled his older brother. There was quite person who was temporarily living in my house and they had this conferences and training sessions after curfew. ities of my mother. She allowed her house to be place this gentleman. His name was Jan Savada he was prewar , real name. And they were reporting that they killed two traitors and they left a short note on the c AK, which was underground army. So this boy was crying, telling his colleagues that his younger, older brother was killed by knew the truth. He was killed because he was traitor, but obviously was not interest of the boy to tell the truth. So a lot of stories which you hear and you read not always were true because for whatever reasons, people were hiding the real reasons. saw it again and again and again and there was in all the villages, d oesn™t matter age. For different reasons people are having second mask, second face to survive and there were different motives but there was a fight for survival. First was life to save and second was to get food. Q: The trainings that were hosted at your mother™s house, do you remember that and do you remember what kind of training? A: Quite often doors was close and my bed was literally one yard from the door. Door was thin and th ey were talking in regular voice. Besides there was through because they happened to be parents of my colleagues or friends tion team. Interview with Wies 24 August 15, 2018 Q: Do you remember any of their names?

The ropes for drying clothing. However they were not used for that purpose. They were used as antenna. So that end of that wire went into the wall, down to my kitchen. And then came out in the form of power socket. But if you plugged the, your whatever, hair brush or you know you couldn™t get any power in there, because there was no power. There was, this transmitter was connected when this c rew was coming. They had the plug for power. That was the, that was one of the reasons why coming to our house, because antenna they didn™t have to spread antenna outside.

We were self-trained. Q: So this was after the war. A: After the war immediately. And a lot of young people died be cause farmers needed the fields before so that army came. The people who are disarming mines in the fields, they wanted to plow the fields. And the mines here there and there and you never know where so they were training mine young people who they were training, paying young people who were foolish enough to go and dismember. And a friend of mine, two years, three years older than me, a think a couple days ago. He was learning how to disarm that, these mines. And similar, his friends and their fri end s were hired by farmers which was le go in to the fields. And they were many of them successful. Some, many of them survived, but some unfortun ately made mistakes somewhere or they didn™t know they stepped on a mine which were all hidden under the ground and they didn™t have electronic equipment to detect it.

You were allowed to do that but mostly was not what you were, what is forbidden. And that was the way Œ f not knowing. You had to know it so you had to read it because your life depended on that, what™s on t he poster. memories of that?

You know there was a Œ Interview with Wies 33 August 15, 2018 Q: Being circumcised. A: Yeah, because non on an d there was like a rule. And that Germans, it was for them most last test. But sometime was not sufficient. They had you know they all kind of relationships. German to survive in Poland locally, they had to somehow relate. They couldn™t be just suiting l eft and right. They needed authorities had assi gnments. So many people they need for work. Every day different people. Sometimes people worked two, three times a week. S ometimes were paid a little bit, others were not paid. They all varied but assignment was they needed. So for road work, for some other ple would be stealing food so they tried to separate food from people. But they didn™t have enough people of their own. Soldiers had tasks in the army or they went to the front, eastern front. They ou know all the Œ Góra Kalwaria . They were the last one to be packed in the last cart and they wer e sent to Warsaw ghetto and then to Treblinka and you know other -- to gas chambers. Germans didn™t feel loyal towards those who were cooperating with them. But at the time when they need it, they found all you just one thing. My mother had the observation that in war time is the time when you have the opportunity to recognize who are good people, who are bad people. That among our nest to be fair, to be real human beings, w ith empathy were su rprise d to have respect, they became real heroes. Really honest people who people you recognize when real test, real need comes in life. That people have differ ent recaniam, differ ent layers and you have really to know the essence of a human person is to remove all these layers first. And the war is the time when real test on the characters of the people. Interview with Wies 34 August 15, 2018 Q: All right. So in Warsaw several times. My mother was coming , doing some trading and visiting friends. We had some friends in Warsaw and on several occasions my mother took me and we walked along the walls where the cobblestone pavement of the street , sidewalk on outside street paved, and then the wall of the ghetto was almost on the edge of the street, or very narrow sidewalk. The wall on that section was, had no windows and you can see the signs where windows wer e at the bottom wh ere once in a while there were small narrow windows, which had iron bars densely installed that a person, no maybe cat could sneak in but a person couldn™t. But often when we are in the same area, we saw children™s heads sticking out, outside through that wind ow and they were either, they would see quite o ften people walking on the other side and they were showing that give me something, give me something. And not far from there was a stand with vegetables, where you can buy carrots, onions, celery, something which you can you know person can eat raw and on several occasions my mother with observing when the gendarmes were walking their backs towards, back another one. So it means they walking away and they were not opposite direction and they were not looking at us on the sidewalk on the ot her side of the street. And we are throwing these carrots and these kids were grabbing them and eating t hem. You can see them. They were very hungry and every piece of carrot was consumed almost on spot. You can see how was appreciated. So my mothe our self, but she was giving it to me to teach me be empathetic and help other children. Children helping children. being was our standing on the tram stop. was like a raised area and in one particular place there was Ulitsa [ph] and there was like tramway place where they were, hangar where there were Interview with Wies 35 August 15, 2018 several trains were ready to, they were stored there temporarily. And they were before they got on their routine trip. And this particular day afternoon, sunny day, a truck comes and there were soldiers come from the cabin and truck is covered and full of the prisoners. And they commanding them to get out. They putting them against the wall and one with the machine gun, kills the entire row. And other prisoners are asked, another truck comes and asked to take these bodies with hands and legs. You know one person holding legs and Œ to throw them on that truck and they were taking them re member some women were putting their hands on children™s eyes not to letting them to see it. But you know kids, even if they always between the fingers or they managed to see it. There is no way. Q: Did you mother try to do that? Did she Œ g that and strange enough that these people as sometime would happening, they were not raising, they were not shouting. They knew they were being killed but they didn™t shout. [ph] let™s leave Poland free or something like that. They were shouting in Polish. These people, that particular group and there them but there must have been several dozen people killed this way. Mostly men that were killed. Q: Do you think they were, were they non ? dn™t see And after all of that show which was done purposely by Germans to scare people to make demonstration because they could take these people them. They did it in public places, purposely to spread a fear. To spread the, to tell people watch it be cause if you don™t behave you will be killed as they are. That w as the message that they wanted to send and so it was interesting reaction of the people. Once, of the people who were watching that, once -- Interview with Wies 36 August 15, 2018 say l ess than hundred yards from that. Not always every of these prisoners who were killed on spot. Sometimes they were moving so Germans were still walking around and they were shooting in their head here and there. From the, you know hand gun. Once that show ended the trucks went and police freed us to proceed. Trams were not moving, traffic was stopped for that they restored the traffic and then people were going t full of blood. Blood was in the street, curb where the rain normally goes, how do you call it? Q: Drains. A: Drain. So and their behavior, the people who were watching were behaving. Some people were laying down, some people crying, some people were kind of you know touching and spite of being eight, nine, ten years old. Basically nine because ten years old it was already war is over. Q: Do you remember talking about it with your mother and did she have any Œ A: t was so shocking for her. Y like Œ Q: n shock. A: Shock you know so the concept of PTSD we didn™t know that acronym. Nobody knew about this, what does it mean at that time, but for young people like myself this takes, you cannot nough of study and knowledge what tragic situations like the war like the memories of human beings treated worse than animals are treated, quite o fte n, have impact on the psyche of young people Interview with Wies 37 August 15, 2018 shak e about that because it just disturbs me so deeply and that takes me longer time then to get back to my normal ment al and psych ic so to speak.

You can be empathetic but it™s a degree to is doing, saving for generations is so impo rtan t. So impo rtant beca use other places there is some central archives here and there but that needs to be made available for as much as possible, especially younger generations. That™s my hope. That™s my hope. Interview with Wies 39 May 23, 2019 Nancy Cooey: All right. This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with rd The other interview was conducted in October 2018. Wes, we ended our last conversation talking about the end of the war but we want to back up a deported to Auschwitz and then spent time in different camps. Wes Orlowski: Yes, so my father was outside of our home about 25 kilometers from us in center of Warsaw when he was arrested by Germans, taken to the temporary headquarters where he was tortur him to know. And then he was transported to Auschwitz and Œ Q: Do you know when that was? was a few of time by, but by the end of war, Germans were more lenient, when it comes to the, allowing families , prisone rs and prisoners them self to communicate between them self. So we are allowed that by the end of war to send some short letters, written in German and small packages. Packages had to be limited in size and weight and mostly vegetables which he had to shar e with his inmates, that were in the same room w here Œ t years later, he was, they had bunk beds in one room. Eleven of them and so when he received the parcel he, as well as if they did, they had to share it w ith the inmates. Q: Do you know which barracks he was in? that f original letters , written in German - one from Auschwitz and one from Mauthausen . And they are i shortly after he arrived in Mauthausen. So my father survived both camps, through several, because of several factors. One of them he knew some German but he was learning very fast due Interview with Wies 40 May 23, 2019 to the presence -- he befriended some people there who knew German and they were kind of self, teaching themselves, so my father was participating in this informal classes. Second, he was relatively healthy. He was entrepreneurial because was that he had skills as an accountant and they employed him in the office for keeping some records, probably you know suitcases, shoes and whatever. They, as we know, Germans are very systematic and they were keeping records of everything. So my father survived and they were also, he had some access to the kitchen as a help. And then every body in the kitchen you try to steal as much as possible so you can have food later. Everybody was doing that. There are some reports. My father didn™t do that but people who were wearing, carrying bread in their pockets til the end of their life, long time after the liberation. And they were, you know 50 years later but they are still carrying bread in their pockets. You can imagine what kind of the insecurity these people were going and what kind of fears they went through. Q: What information did your fat A: My father was telling me how they , he participated in the death march so there were hundreds of prisoners organized in groups and they were, with guards, they were chased by foot from Auschwitz camp to many, ma ny miles along the streets and roads to the railroad station which had connection with Austria. And then they were packed into the cars and then unloaded in Vienna in Austria on the -- d one lett er mother. She lives, she lived in Silesian region which was southern Poland, much closer to Austria. And that was written obviously in German with both cases th ere are his numbers which that time, which block, which how they call it here. Block and shtuber Œ Q: So he left on the death march in Œ Interview with Wies 41 May 23, 2019 A: And he survived it because many, many Œ survived this march because if anybody become weaker, became weaker and neighboring prisoners walked with him couldn™t carry him, you know holding his elbows, now he had to be left on the, on the side of the road and last German guard who was passing, he would shoot him and then they would leave the body for the rock hole. Q: But he was strong enough to survive the march. A: But my father was strong enough and apparently he took care of himself. And one of the a lot. And he claims that kept his sanity more or less stable and because there were many cases the people couldn™t take it anymore so they were throwing the ir bodies on the electrical fences and electrocuting them self to death. My complemented my knowledge by reading more about that. The conditions for, in, for prisoners in Mauth ausen were much, much worse than in Auschwitz. Mauthausen was considered one of the most severe German camps where first prisoners and the camp was set already after the, on the . They started this camp in the quarry. They digging huge, huge area of quarries in the side of the mountain to prevent this place to be bombed by the enemies™ bombers. And there were the entire parties. The planes they were built there. The ammunition was put together from the parts. There were, they worked into shifts. Sometimes three shifts, taking turns. The prisoners were very poor. The average life span for the prisoner in Mauthausen was two months. And my father survived seven months and was libera on May fifth by a unit of US Army. Q: Do you know what kind of work he was doing in the camp? A: All kinds of it. They were shifting them so that he was working with the ammunition for some time. Some time he was in the office, bookkeeping a gain which fortunately the knowledge of German by y were employing him in the less physically strenuous situations. The worst was for the people who had to push heavy Interview with Wies 42 May 23, 2019 carts filled of you know stones or, or where there were not enough people to, to Œ So they were menial work. Consequently, he worked, he walked from Mauthausen in Austria to Gó ra Kalwaria in Poland. Very early he was able to get on some freight where he was nearby of the railroad station and the freight was stopped and so he could climb the train but was not regular Q: Did he talk about liberation and his emot ions at liberation? A: Well they are all ecstatic but they were in such a poor physical conditions. They, their joy was limited to the food which they could eat and the stomach problems they had. Because when they started to eat they didn™t know where to end. Then their stomachs were not accustomed to have normal food and plenty of food. So they were really suffering. Many of them, they had digestive problems and so they quickly learning how both the prisoners and the people who were giving them food to be very careful how they transitioned to the normal life. Q: When your father got back home, do you remember seeing him for the first time after the war? Œ because as he walked from Austria, they were able to enter the empty houses which were abandoned by German population in western Polish territory and so they take some time and the clothing which didn™t fit them or the y were you know partially broken or something so he was ve ry funny dressed, first struck me. A that my mother had made a conversation with him and he went to live with his mother and his sister. And eventually my parents divorced because it was very difficult for my mother to raise Œ Q: What kind of personality changes did he have? Interview with Wies 43 May 23, 2019 A: Nightmares, short temper. Sometime he can talk illogical statements and there was no, one could not have a apparently was increasing. And on the one hand he was happy that he was liberated obviously. But on the other hand this life style which they had is -- changed their every person obviously, every prisoner was reacting in different way. But they, they out, their outlook of the world outside changed so radically that they didn™t know They didn™t un derstand what was going with them. There were a lot of what you would call today PTSD, was not known at the time. But all forms of that kind of trauma was engraved o they were st ill living so to speak, awaking in the morning. And they were surprised that they are, don™t have to Q: Do you think later in his life he found ways of dealing with it or coping with it? A: He must have because he started anothe r family and haven™t been in the close contact with him at that time, at the end of his life. He lived til the age, haven™t seen besides , for many years. Œ Q: What does it mean, you were kicked out of your home or Œ A: We are told to leav e our home, in the short notice. Entire town and neighboring villages and the whole street along the Vistula river. And the reason was that we live on western shore of the Vistula river and on eastern shore Soviet army approached chasing Germans. And Vistu la river became the border line, between two armies, German army and Soviet army. And our house was on high shore of Vistula River, easily visible from the other shore of the river. And the snipers, how do you call them. Sharp snipers w ith their lunette t hey could see any moving object and they were shooting. So we were for a short time we are living in our house, but we had to go Interview with Wies 44 May 23, 2019 with our head down and almost crawl because we could easily be you know shot like that still in the home. And -- Q: Where did you go? A: So we went with two suitcases and my cat coming in a bag on my neck. We walked and then we, for about several miles. And then eventually we hired for a small fee a farmer with his cart and horse and several families to share that vehicle. And we went to one of the villages where we rented a small place in the barn. And then we rented one room in the house. And then we wanted, went to another village. And that were where Polish underground fighters from Warsaw We kept th em from helping them to change dressings on the ir wounds. And they after a few weeks they left. They were taken by other units of underground movement during the night. But nearby there was a big artillery unit, German. And there was aiming obviously tow ards east against Soviets. Then certain day in the morning we see they are turning their guns aiming to the west, 180 degrees reversal and we were completely shocked. Well what™s -- they will be shooting their own units. Then we realized that they were ready to defend against the encircling , the th But before that these German units which were in our neighborhood in the countryside, they were aiming towards west . They are not shooting at that time, but they were aiming towards west. Because Russian army already encircled them from the, from the west . The only open area where they had is towards Warsaw, towards north. So they eventually put the stuff together. happened to them. Whether they were caught in , in encirclement or they were able to successfully to go west. Q: Did you return home at that point? A: At this point we were free to go home and we, around the time of liberation of the Warsaw, we came with our two suitcases to our home and our home was really plundered and whatever Interview with Wies 45 May 23, 2019 was able, people who were stealing the items and they did a good job. are approaching our house, we saw a gentleman or gentleman, there was you know, who my mother knew. He was carrying on his back fro nt door of our house so my mother told him you better leave it h ere. And, and he dropped the door, apologized because he didn™t know whose house was it and he didn™t Œ Q: He didn™ t put it back on? A: And my mother was his teacher so he recognized my mother as a teacher and anyhow. After the war, life , we were all ec static obviously but there were huge shortages of everything and food was the most important . The farmers which were all around did their best and to feed their families and have something to sell and feed us, you know people living in this small town. We a lot of skills at that time. Q: What were you growing? A: Well all basic vegetable root, root vegetables. Which we have good soil because chemicals unknown were getting manure from farmers . My mother was coping herself and helping children. A lot of children were behind the regular program in Polish language, math, biology, geography Œ all the basic subjects in the grammar school. But my mom was do ing tutorials at home. After the classes, regular school classes. So these children on the way home they were stopping by and you know not many, two, three, one sometime. But quite often there was somebody in my house where my mother was teaching. And th ese children were, most of them, they were children of farmers and there was a voluntary agreement. And they were bringing eggs, a small can of milk and homemade cheese. A chicken sometimes live, sometime killed but freshly. So we are trying to survive be cause stores were empty at the beginning. took many months. People could function in their normal so to speak normally. Interview with Wies 46 May 23, 2019 Q: How did her job change w ith the c ommunists in power? because my mother and, and all her colleagues they were prewar teachers. So they knew the program and they had, some of them they save d the books or made copies of the books of prewar . They were not accepted officially by the communist authorities because they w change much, but history books they were no, no for the communist times. The communist authorities . S o a lot of teaching was based either from these fragments of the books which were left by, saved by the teachers. Or from their memories. Or teachers were teaching one another Some of that, depending who was behind the pack, who was unofficial and they were kind of the -- between the real facts and phantom history which communists wanted to teach. And the history as the older people knew. History is not only what is in the books but what™s in people™s memory, especially older people™s memory. So there were very difficult times. My mother was very involved in the teachers union. Before war she was participating in demonstrations in Warsaw. But after the war there was obviously the teachers union , labor union was penetrated by communists. They were open or secre t agents. So we need to learn quickly d to learn how to read between the lines what™s in newspapers. We had to learn quickly not to believe official propaganda. We have to learn quickly how to, man or woman, a radio receiver and how to listen to radio Free Europe or BBC from England. Radio Free Europe stations were located just over the border in west, in eastern Germany. Several transmitters on different frequencies and to learn that the Polish authorities are having rad io stations on the same frequency located in Poland which does, were sending huge noise garbled up and noise mechanical noise which the purpose of that was just to squash the regular signals coming from Radio Free Europe from Germany. Q: What programs do you remember listening to? A: Oh there were all publicity programs. They were interviewing interesting people and they were you know Œ we, at the beginning we believed whatever was said then because it was so Interview with Wies 47 May 23, 2019 different and refreshing what was the official propaganda. Gradually we started to learn how to read and listen with some criticism and Œ Q: To the BBC and Radio Free Europe. A: T o the BBC and Radio Free Europe . They were a different type of propaganda as we learned. After some time. Q: Was that in English? A: No, in Polish. Everything was in Polish. No, no it was directed to Polish population. Q: The BBC was also. A: But, but authorities were chasing it so people were doing very secretly in the evening. Not too loud so neighbors wouldn™t hear but a lot of people were doing. Even those who claimed to be communists and believing in theory of communism, we learned later they were listening to these radio stations as well. So Œ that you could trust and neighbors you couldn™t trust. A: Yes, yes. During the war, from the very beginning my mother had a saying that real friends you recognize and distinguish from so called friends where the people have to do the sacrifices and people have to go beyond the comfort zone. So the people are Œ many of our neighbors which we had thought was not, were not very highly about them, they appeared full of sacrifices , ready to take their last shirt and give you if you need it. So to speak, symbolically. And people who we had high esteem appeared not worse you know opinion so to speak because they became either selfish or they became agents you know and they were ready to spy on you and report to authorities. So learning whom you could trust and to what was one of the major skills, human skills that one had to learn. Interview with Wies 48 May 23, 2019 Q: Did those neighbors change at all after the communists came to power? Were certain neighbors who you could trust during the war, could you no longer trust them after the war? A: T e discovered by the Polish underground movement during the war, that they were cooperating with Germans and they were caught and proven, they were taken on the side somewhere in the, outside of everybody™s view and they were shot and killed by the special units of Polish underground movement and it was very obvious reason. To give a lesson to rest of the society that it™s not the approved way of behaving. Plus they had to be removed because they are doing so much damage and so many people lost lives beca use of the people like that. So yes, they were, there are all kinds of the behaviors. There are people who were indecisive that then became very cooperative. People who were cooperative and they change their mind and they became selfish. There were trial periods for everybody. Everybody was certain in their comfort zone and stay unengaged in any way. and talk about your education. A: Yeah, so my education started from self -education eaching there like a sponge. said no you can go to second grade and you are, you know more about that. So my mother d grade and from the, from that second grade to the grades. However, in the last two years of my high school there was an older than all of us, young man cam Interview with Wies 49 May 23, 2019 to be the best. There were all kids who were coming to me with you know problems to solve or something helpful to other students. or five years older than us and he had so much schooling in that seminary so Warsaw Polytech to the department of electronics which was a direction, well if young men ask older time it was electronics was a popular direction everybody wanted to learn about electronics. And through in, it was 11 semester program. There was where we couldn™t get a BS, b achelor of science. We had to go for a masters. So in one chunk without interrupting there was the first course of that entire college. mas ter™s degree. So after almost ten semesters regular study at the class, where it was the time to write dissertation, myself and two of my closest friends, we started to work in industrial institute for telecommunications. And was semi radars which were later installed on commercial ships and ocean going ships. lot of tran slations from literature, French five languages. Q: Did you lea rn all these languages in school? A: Some of them Œ my first of Œ they were still visiting us from Warsaw. But then he was taken to Auschwitz. That didn™t prevent two contractual workers from France. One was of Russian origin and the other Stanislaw and Nissinger . Mr. Nissinger was a, had a background. His ancestors were white Interview with Wies 50 May 23, 2019 and his family escaped to Paris. And he was educated there so he was fluent in Russian a remember he was talking a little bit of Russian to me, both of them talking French and Mr. Stanislaw Malinowski was knowing Polish but kind of the broken Polish. So an interesting conversation at the table. They were bringing me some food with them. They were cooking on. A Q: Did they make you catch the frogs? mother™s her home and helping her to, wit to me. S everyday eventually l My times, most of the high schools and regular schools had to have Russian. Somehow my school, my high school omitted or they were able to avoid teaching that. They didn™t have teacher and it was not popular, Russian. That was very helpful for me. French, but it was very, my master™s with master™s degree from Warsaw Poly Tech.

Those are the skills and you cannot easily learn or cannot learn at all in school.

They can be on same corridor, have doors and they don™t say good morning to one another. They pretend that they don™t, they avoid other people. This is not the case. Warsaw at that time had a lot of population coming from smaller cities and from countryside. So of the war. People were much more friendlier, helpful, paying attention one to another, not being afraid to look into other people™s eyes. of young men especially. Being a young man because that™s considered as a challenge. And can end up in being beaten up. Q: Do you think you were misled by that? that was not bad advice. To be on cautious side, not to be too trustful and direct with people, too friendly. Interview with Wies 52 May 23, 2019 Q: What advice did your mother give you when you moved to Warsaw? A: M y mother being born in the countryside and then living more years in small city, didn™t have much to offer in the sense of practical how to behave. More helpful was to have some friends, acquaintance of the acquaintances or have pupils or her coworkers who moved to Warsaw Œ these times there were huge problems with supply of basic goods. So having friends, acquaintances, always allow line of people in the front of the store because there™s not enough room in the store so people are outside, l ong line for enter ____. Forty people stand in line. Most of the people what they do without asking, they will first stand up and take the place in line. And then they started to ask. that .

You put them through this string and you make like a Œ Q: A necklace? A garland? head and you are walking in the street like that which looks funny. Right, but you are not alone in the street. And then you came home and to your good friends you sold them half or whatever your supply. So everybody was trading with everybody else and life was full of activity. Nobody was bored because to survive you had to be industrious, active, working with others, helping one another. Not to be afraid to ask for help but also be ready to give a hand or to share your goods which you received and you consider yourself lucky. A: No Interview with Wies 53 May 23, 2019 Q: O r h? A: Only in Góra Kalwaria. And those are the people who incidentally are recorded already for k Price. Another one is Mr. Kartman. Another one is Mr. Mayevsky. Q: And did you know them? them quite well. One of Mr., especially Mr. Price was working some social organizations which together with my mom in Góra Kalwaria, in his family. And he had one daughter from Gosha and she™s one of the three peo ple to recommend for the museum to interview. Mr. Price and the others are, died. Mr. Price was through college or your master™s program? A: Several. Q: There were several? A: Yeah there were several but as it happens, many of them , they had Polish names and they r So several of them background. Poland was the country where there were all kinds of the e the place spectrum of activities. Some of them they were part of the communist establishment. Some of them ethnic origin was not enough to make any judgement depending on how these people were behaving. What they were Interview with Wies 54 May 23, 2019 doing. What they are doing some good for the environment for where they live , where the people were living. Or they were involved in arrests you know and other not popular causes. So it™s , it was a judgmental e who came from France and where he were part of the French underground movement. His brother became the owner of the major in wine, how to cook. Chicken, chicken. Q: What was his name? Q: When did you finish your master™s program? n majority of my col en we have done with our masters. Most of us were already working because we are strip of money. We couldn™t support ourselves so we were looking for jobs, working as young engineers and the salaries were poor but if they allow you to survive and that™s apartment because there was narrow gauge train which took almost one hour and a half, like one hour and 20 minutes one way. So Œ Q: What was your first job out of school? A: My, after semi -conductor devices in high s section tubes in which the electromagnetic signals were sent and th is semiconductor devices were put inside and they were you know measurements you know how they were detecting that and all kinds of Œ it™s based on the really cutting edge science. One of the funny things is which Interview with Wies 55 May 23, 2019 probably many people in the west didn™t know that there was an embargo on the communist countries and normally you couldn™t get most modern equipment and for electronic engineers, having good like today you have a computer. At that time in 50s you had to have an oscillator. And one of the best oscillators in the worl d was American Techtronic™s and we had the most modern electronics which were embargoed by US. How it happened. There were go between in Switzerland which for cash th ey would sell you this equipment but what they would do, they would mechanically remove the serial number on that so that nobody could trace it back who sold to whom. So it was a lot of equipment which we had in our labs through the purchasing agents whic h were having cash with them, they went to Switzerland, and we have the most modern equipment. Q: What brought you to the US? A: Fulbright Fellowship. Q: When did you receive that? -- Academy of Sciences. One is in a short time was institute of basic technical -- of the, was called electronic institute of technology and Œ because id not have the PhD and unofficially that time company which was managing communication in air corridors. So we are in charge of radio beacons in the corridors , instrumental landing sy them was in charge of installation of the first instrumental landing system in enche international first instrumental landing system established in eastern Europe. And it was a British equipment pipe. That ™s where knowledge of British English was helpful. Interview with Wies 56 May 23, 2019 ending r another hour or was working another job with the same institution which was paid separately. And there was a research you typing it. My conventional type all electric, maybe she had. Q: That™s a lot of pressure to have to Œ evenings and the weekends and weekends and it requires a lot of tech consult with the engineer and aircraft engineers sometime and that it was, it allowed me to save enough money to buy apartment in Warsaw that mortgage and then paid it to the end and became the owner. Q: We™ll take a break. Nancy Cooey: Ok, we™re back. So you were going to tell me about the youth organization that you were part of. ody with the d very strong reasons why they didn™t have to be members of this youth organization which in the name was like union of Polish youth. That was the official name in Polish, but what it meant is it was a communist organization. the years the communist party which again was not called in Poland communist party. They were called party of Polish workers. That™s what was the official name. Everything was camouflaged and what not called by name. But the youth organization was like preparation for the activity in Interview with Wies 57 May 23, 2019 adults party which was elite of people who had responsibility but also access to the special privileges, which involved purchase of the items which were not available for common people. Behind so called yellow curtains and because they had yellow curtains in the windows. From the street you couldn™t see if there was a street level, what™s inside, but you have entered. For very nominal prices you can get, almost like in the west full variety of goods. Some of these younger activists were members of the communist party and member as well of sons usually or daughters o f communist activists. Belgium and France and they were sent to Poland. For their activities, communist activities. They wound up in Poland. They had children and these best schools. One could get. And walk to the field and pretend that you are shooting or whatever. Not every ROTC. Again for was , - there was in M semester in the college and a studying diet. And there was a huge demonstration of solidarity and memorial in the front. There was a big podium and all the officials, first secretary of the workers party. You know and all o f them, they were on a big podium. And we had to walk, the long walk and there was borders on this sidewalks. There were activists with the bands on their arms, marking they are activists of the youth organization and they were boarding so nobody could run away from that march. So we had concentration places where we gather ed. The lists were checked. Everybody had to mark you know with his name with red. And there was marking if he™s present. No school whole day was for a _____ . And there was not good weather. Anyhow we gathered that and then in orderly manner we had to walk in the front of these officials, waving to them cheerfully. And then in the so mber kind of the mood because we are all in -- Q: Mourning Interview with Wies 58 May 23, 2019 A: Mourning death of our leader so to speak you know.

She is using for many years now only this. Because it™s more convenient. What™s interesting is that because of the agreement between the governm ents, US and other countries signed an agreement that if US is going to grant Fulbright fellowship, these grantees started to be counted from the day of the departure of this guarantee from the US.

We in Poland we didn™t use the word Nazi occupation as it™s used over in this country. We were saying German occupation because it was Germany was occupying, not Nazis. Nazis was a party that took control of Germany, but there was Germans. Germany couldn™t conduct the war without support of majority of the country. And the sons and daughters were dying on behalf of Germany, not Nazis. t again and again because it™s a very strong falsification of the history. This is not the way history is being seen in E e was a u would have been killed by a G er he Interview with Wies 64 May 23, 2019 was Nazi or not Nazi. Nobody in Poland was really paying attention to whether it as Nazi or not Nazi. My father was tortured and taken concentration camp was not important for him whe ther Nazis or not Nazis. He was beaten, kicked and, and was losing teeth because of beating and not because you know Nazis or not Nazis. He was beaten by Germans. That™s a very strong se there is so much of distortion of the can have all kinds of the fantasies, they can write all kind of the things, but we in Eastern Europe we learned how to read between the lines and what™s the truth and what™s the falsification afterwards. One of the r ea r 80 years. Because there is no substitu te of l iving To have eyewitnesses.

And it™s a lot of things to be learned from other people. One of the most shocking t of the appreciation by younger, appreciation of th younger genera and culture as it is. And soci eties as they are, are losing a lot without consulting what they are doing with the older gener a i in educational system that schools are not encouraging older people to come be tutors. The, you know younger ge nerat ion, they think they know everything and they know better and they have no respect of older people. So they gap between grandparents, children and especially grandparents and their grandchildren is in my opinion unacceptable. That needs to change because it™s a question of survival of, of the Interview with Wies 68 May 23, 2019 nations, of people as they are and not to speak about environment which needs to be respected. betw t my youth . The respect for o lder people was much higher in ships and intergenerational communications and the respect and just spending time together and talking, talking about how was it. To learn something from that. Not to repeat the same mistakes.
