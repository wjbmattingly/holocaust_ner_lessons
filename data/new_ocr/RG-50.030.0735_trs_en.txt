A: Well, my parents, I don't think they wo uld have come so eas ily. They were born there, you know, in Germany.

Q: Really? A: Yeah. Ten years old. I went to high school, the equivalent to high school, in Germany. By the way, I didn't have that school where I come from. It was a little village.

A: Many children, many parent s who could afford to send them to a better school, that's what it amounts to. So in a better school, it's the equivalent, I lear ned English and French at that time, chemistry. We had all the subjects in that school, but not the school in Luelsfeld. We were in the school just for four years. Q: Did you like studying? Did you like school? A: I wasn't crazy about it. I was not a ba d student, but I didn't study enough, I guess. Q: So it didn't it was okay, but nothing special? A: Nothing special. Interview with Sol Kohn 34 Q: Okay. A: I didn't want to make a career out of anything. Q: Well, that's kind of young to have to make a mind up about what kind of career. A: I went to that school when I was ten years old already. Q: The Realschule? A: Yeah, from from public school. That's what you do in Germany, in Europe I guess. You go up to go to public school for four years and then you go to a high school. But little villages where I come from, they didn't have th at high school Q: Right? A: which is the equivalent to a Realschule, what we called them. Q: So when you were in Holland now and it's 1938 and 1939 A: Not '39. I was in Ho lland only less than a year. Q: Less than a year? So A: They wouldn't give me permission to work there. Q: So how were you successful in leavin g Holland? How did y ou manage to go from Holland, the Netherlands to I take it you came to America? A: Yeah. Q: How did you manage that? A: Well, I number one, I had to get an affidavit. You couldn't come here. Q: I see, that's where you got the affidavit? A: You could come here as vis itor, but you cannot come here a nd stay for for a year or two years. Interview with Sol Kohn 35 So someone gave me an affidavit. Q: And where did you come? To which place did you come? A: Excuse me? Q: When you left Holland where did you go? A: To New York. Q: Did the person who gave you the affidavit live in New York? A: I never met that person. Q: You never met them? A: No, never. But somebody gave me I really, I don't know how it happened. Q: So when you A: I had relatives here, but they wouldn't give me an affidavit. Q: Really? A: Yeah. I had sorry to say, my mother had two brothers here and a sister. They didn't do anything for the family. Q: Oh. A: Sadly. Q: Well, it's kind of bitter. A: Yes. Q: So did they help you when you came to the United States? A: No, no. Q: Nothing, huh? A: I came I didn't come from Germany to America. I went first to Holland. Interview with Sol Kohn 36 Q: That's right. A: I told you that. Q: That's right. A: And in November '38, I came here to America. Q: So where did you live when you came here? A: In New York. Q: I mean, but A: New York City. Q: Yeah, but who did you live with ? Did you live with a family? A: With a family. Fortunately, I got a job after a week. Q: What was the job? What was the job? A: I worked in a I was in the receiving department. There was a firm Klein. Ever heard of S. Klein? Q: I have heard of Klein, yeah. A: They only went out of business like ten or 12 years ago or 15 years ago. I got a job after a week. I was lucky. Q: Where was the business located? A: Fourteenth Street or Union Square. Q: And what kind of family did you live with? Were they acquaintances or A: Yeah, I heard of these people from Germany and I lived with them. I had a nice room on Amsterdam Avenue , 181st Street. Q: Wow. Interview with Sol Kohn 37 A: I remember that. Q: And did you go to school at all or did you go straight to work? A: I should have gone to school here. Q: Uh huh. A: But I had to work. I could have gone to night school. Q: When you were okay, so you're over here in the United States. What happened with your brother and your sister, did they also leave or tell me about them. A: My brother, he also left later on and he went to Holland. Q: Okay. Also? A: I don't know I don't know how it happe ned because I was in Holland too and they wouldn't let me stay there. Q: Yeah. A: Because but the rest of my family, my parents and my sister, they remain in Germany and they died in the Holocaust. Q: Did you when you were first in New York, were you writing letters back and forth with your family? A: Yeah. Q: And A: I have the letters here yet. Q: You still have those letters? A: Yeah. Q: Wow. Interview with Sol Kohn 38 A: I cannot look at them. Too sad. Q: Were there many such letters? A: Excuse me? Q: Did you write often? Did they write often? A: Not that often. Q: And did they tell you did they write about how things were continuing to change for them in Germany? A: Well, everybody knew about it, too. Th e sad part is my mother had two brothers and a sister and they wouldn't do anything for my parents. Nothing. If I and I had I couldn't give an affidavit. I had no paid income. Q: Had you gone to ask your mother's brother and brothers and sisters A: Yes, yes. Q: to help and they said no? A: They didn't say that. They said they would help. Q: They said they would? A: They didn't do anything. Nothing. Q: At some point did your parents write that they wanted to leave Germany? A: I imagine. Q: Oh, but you don't have a letter that said , we'd like to leave Germany? No. How long did the letters continue, to what year? A: Well, I came here in '38. In '42 I we nt to American army, World War II. You're familiar with that? Interview with Sol Kohn 39 Q: Um hum. A: So I corresponded with them for three, four years. Q: Until you went into the army? A: Yeah. Q: And then after that, no more correspondence? A: They were killed at that time, at that time. Q: How did you find out? A: How I find out? From some people who knew about it in that village, in that neighborhood. Q: So were there Germans non Jews A: German people. Q: who wrote to you and told you? A: Yeah. I matter of fact, there was a family who corresponded with me even after the war, after, afterwards. Q: And they let you know what had happened to your father and your mother and so on? A: Yes. They told me. Matter of fact, I went to Germany with my wife when she was still alive at that time to visit the home town, the village I was born. People were very nice. Not everybody was a Nazi, you know, or a Jew hater. But many were. Q: Was that a shock when you when things changed overnight when Hitler came to power, was that a shock to you? A: For everybody. The Jewish people at th at time, if they had a chance, they left. Interview with Sol Kohn 40 Q: Did you ever when is this is a kind of strange kind of question to ask, but is there a point where you stopped feeling German? A: Yes. Q: When was that point? A: At that time. Q: At that time? A: Yeah. Q: Okay. A: At that time. Q: It was like, I no longer belong here. This is no longer my country. Was that it? A: Yes. They were anti Jewish, so that's the end. Q: Tell me A: I had I once counted in the thirties, I would say about 35 pe ople who died in the Holocaust, uncles, aunts, cousins. Q: From your family alone? A: From my family, on my mother's side, father's side. I reme mber three uncles and three aunts, cousins, second cousins. I had some cousins who came out like I did. My sister, for instance, she didn't come out . She perished in the Holocaust. Q: She was just a young girl. A: She was five years younger than me. Q: Do you know where they were deported to? A: Dachau. Interview with Sol Kohn 41 Q: Your parents were deported to Dachau? A: You heard that name? Q: Yeah. A: Matter of fact, my wife and I I'm going back 12 years, we went and took a trip to Germany. And we were stationed there in Munich. We just went back not to see Germany, really, but we went to Europe. We were in Switzerland, actually. But I rented a car and went to Germany. Q: To see where you were born? A: And I went to my home town, the village I was born in. Q: And did it look different? A: And I wanted to go and see Dachau, but fortunately unfortunately, it was closed that day. I couldn't take another trip. Q: Did you see your own home town in Luelsfeld? A: Yeah. Q: Did it look any different? A: Same. Q: Same? A: The neighbors were very nice. Not all not all Germans were Nazis. There were a lot of the younger people were. Q: At that time? A: They were in the SS. You heard about it? Q: Yes, yes. Interview with Sol Kohn 42 A: You heard about that? Q: Yes. So tell me what was my thought here? The German family that wrote to you, did th ey describe how your parents disappeared? I mean A: No. Q: did they describe the circumstances? A: I didn't ask them, okay, because I knew. They didn't have to write me and I didn't have to ask them. They were one day they were told in that village to go to a town Würzburg. You ever heard of it? Q: Würzburg, um hum. A: Oh, you heard of it? They were the next biggest town. And I came from a very small village. And they sent them to a concentration camp and gassed them. That's all I know. That was the end. Q: And your brother, what happened with him? A: My brother? Q: He went to Holland? A: He went to Holland. Q: And then what happen ed? Let's cut for a minute. (Proceedings interrupted by a phone call.) A: I lost maybe 30 people in my family. Gran dparents, uncles, aunts, cousins, all total. Interview with Sol Kohn 43 Q: I can't imagine what it's like to not know what happens to people, to realize that your family has been taken away and you are so far away. I can't imagine what kind of a feeling that is. A: The sad part is, I had family here and th ey wouldn't give me an affidavit to bring them out. Terrible. That's the terrible thing. Q: Did someone give your brother an affidavit eventually? A: My brother, he he went to Holland. How he got there, I don't know. Q: How did he leave there? How did he leave Holland? A: I don't know how he got there. Q: Okay. A: Because I was in Holland, but they wouldn't let me st ay in Holland. Q: Of course. Of course. Did he stay the whole time in Holland or did he also come to America? A: Didn't come to America. Q: Ah, did he stay then in Holland during the war? A: Yeah. Q: So he must have hidden? A: Well, I don't know too much about it, but we corresponded. But he went to Sweden then later on. He was in a kibbutz, like. Do you know what a kibbutz is? Q: Uh huh. So he went to Israel? A: No, he didn't go to Israel. But the last ti me I I heard or I know about, he went from Holland to Sweden. Interview with Sol Kohn 44 Q: And then what happened with him? A: He died. Q: During the war? A: No later, later. Q: Oh, I see. I see. A: He was in the kibbutz like. Q: In Sweden? A: In Holland. Q: There was a kibbutz in Holland? A: It's like a kibbutz. Q: Like a kibbutz? And then A: An organization, a Jewish organization let's call it. Q: And A: And they probably sent him to Sweden to save the children Q: That's right. A: the people. Q: Okay. And in Sweden when after did he survive the war? A: Yeah. Q: Okay. Did he ever come to the United States? A: No. Q: Did you ever visit him in Sweden? A: No. Interview with Sol Kohn 45 Q: Did he stay in Sweden, your brother? A: The last I heard of him, he was in Sweden. But that's about it. Q: I see. I see. So he didn't die in the Holocaust, but he nevertheless died after the war? A: Yeah. I imagine. Because he was in Sweden, he was not in Germany anymore. But my sister died in Germany. She never got out of Germany. But the fact is that, I'm sorry I have to say that, I personally couldn't do very much. And I depended on my family. I had uncles and aunts. They didn't do anything. That's the sad part. That's the sad part. I have an uncle here he came here, let's say, about 1880. He was at that time maybe 70 years old. And he could have give me an affidavit for my family. They didn't do anything. Q: That's very bitter. A: That's the sad part. Q: That's very sad, very sad. A: You know. Q: Yeah. Hang on just a second. (Brief pause.) Q: Absolute sense. I want to talk about your army service? A: Yeah. Q: So were you drafte d or did you A: Drafted. Q: You were drafted. Tell me about your U.S. army experience. Where did they send you for training? Interview with Sol Kohn 46 A: I was in the 28th Infantry. First I was drafted. Q: Okay. A: I don't know exactly I can te ll you what year when I think about it. Q: Okay. A: And I had my basic training. And afte r three, four months I wents to Europe. Q: In 1944? A: Way before. Q: Way before? A: Yeah. Before the invasion. Q: So where did you go, to England? A: First to England, yeah, then Scotland and then to France. Q: Tell me what was your what wa s your job within within A: I was actually in the infantry. I was traine d to be in the infantry and also trained to be an interrogator, because I speak German. Q: I was going to ask about that, yeah. A: So what happened is, one day they ne eded German speaking interrogators. And I ended up in the military government. That was my luck. Q: And this is A: Otherwise I wouldn't be here today. In the division. Q: That's right. A: Still in front. And I interrogated mostly civilians at that time. It's it's I was with the 28th Infantry Division. Interview with Sol Kohn 47 Q: So the 28th Infantry, did that did they take part of the invasion of Normandy A: No, not them. Q: or did they come later? A: I personally came in like I can tell you abou t it, but just let me think like five days after the invasion, I came in already. Q: Okay. A: The American army just had the beachhead. Q: Yes. A: And I was like, what do you call it, ready to be assigned to a unit. Q: Got it, okay. You were in some ways in reserve? A: A replacement. Q: Okay. A: But I had a lot of training in this country before I went overseas. I went to army school, intelligence school and in Camp Ritchie. Q: Oh, you went to Camp Ritchie? A: You heard about that? Q: Of course I've heard about that. A: How do you know about that? Q: Because I have interviewed some people who are Ritchie boys. A: Oh. Q: So you're a Ritchie boy? A: Yeah, the 13th class. Interview with Sol Kohn 48 Q: The 13th class? A: Yeah. Q: So when the army realized that you spoke German like a native A: That's why I went to R itchie, because I spoke German. Q: I see. I see. A: I was inducted into the army and had my basic training and then they saw I speak German, I guess. Q: Yeah. A: So they gave me different training. After after my Q: Basic training. A: basic training. Q: What was that different training? What did it consist of? A: In Ritchie what kind of Q: Training it was, uh huh. A: Army of occupation. They called it intelligence camp. I don't know how intelligent you had to be. But it's different from from the usually the usual training. Q: Yeah. But then you met probably with lots of other people A: Sure. Q: who were in the same situation? A: It was mostly Europeans in Ritchie at that time. Q: Yeah. A: We had to speak German otherwise they wouldn't send you there. Interview with Sol Kohn 49 Q: Yeah. A: They had in mind that I would be used in the army of occupation, being either interrogator or being intelligence. Q: Okay. And you ended up being an interrogator? A: An interrogator. Q: Okay. A: I would say an interrogator, yeah. Q: Do you remember the very first person you interrogated? A: Not the first very not the very first well, I had mostly to do with civilians. Q: Okay. A: It's not I was also trained to interroga te prisoners of war. That actually that was the first thing they taught me, how to interrogate there was a special code Camp Ritchie, you heard about that? Q: Uh huh. A: That was strictly for German speaking people. Q: So tell me, how do you have to wh at are some of the rules in interrogating a prisoner of war? A: There are no rules. Q: What kind of tr aining did you have? A: Get the information that you want. Q: Okay. Interview with Sol Kohn 50 A: All a solder had to do, like I was told, in case we get captured, name, rank and serial number. That's all you have to give, no ot her information. Name, rank and serial number. Q: And when you captured a German solder, he also just had to give name, rank and serial number and your job was to find out more? A: Yeah. So you tried to get information. But I didn't do that very long. Because when I was with the 28th Infantry division Q: Yes? A: who came in, in France. Q: Okay. A: World War II. Q: Yes, that's right. A: You know about that? Q: Yes. A: When we hit Germany, they needed ve ry badly German speaki ng people. And I was with the military government then in the division. I dealt mostly with civilians then. Q: And do you ever have do you have any memories of so me of the interrogations that you did? A: Yeah, I still remember the German people. Q: Tell me about that. A: I tried to get information from them. Q: Were you successful? Interview with Sol Kohn 51 A: Sometimes. Well, most of the time, I would say. Q: Okay. A: If you talk right they answered you, you know. Q: What is the right way to talk? I'm trying to find out your method. A: Well, the method is I was trai ned for that. I was in Camp Ritchie. Q: Sure. A: How to interrogate people. Q: I mean, are you pleasant or are you distant? Do you act with authority and fear or do you use sweetness? A: Well, the way I look at it now, the experience I had, they were glad when the war was over. You know? Q: The people? A: The people. Q: Yeah. A: So that helped. So if you talk right, you got some information out of them. But there were two ways there was interrogating prisoners of war or civilians. I had experience with both of them. Q: How were they different? How did how were they different from each other? A: You have no __________. Q: Yeah? A: At one time sent some soldiers. They were arrogant. And some were glad the war was over and they gave you information. And then you interrogate civilians is a different Interview with Sol Kohn 52 story. Because I worked first with the infantry intelligence department and later I was with the I dealt with civilians. You know what I mean? Q: Yeah. Were civilians easier to interrogate? A: Yeah. Q: Okay. Did you go when you were part of the military government, where were you based, in Germany? A: Where I was what? Q: Where were you based? Where did they take you? A: I was with the division. Q: Okay. Where did the division go? A: Division through Normandy. Q: Um hum. And then? A: Through France, through Germany. Q: What part? What parts of Germany? A: Central Germany I would say. Q: So it would be like Frankfurt and Cologne A: Yeah. Not far from Frankfurt. Near Mannheim. Ever head of Mannheim? Q: Oh, yeah, Mannheim. A: You're not German, right? Q: No, but I have been there. I lived there. So I know Mannheim. A: You've been in Mannheim? Q: Um hum. Interview with Sol Kohn 53 A: I stayed near Mannheim. Q: Near Mannheim, I see. A: The town was I have it written down, but I can't think of it right now. Q: Did you get to Luelsfeld when you were there as part of the military government? A: Not at that time. But after the war, my wife and I, we took a trip to Europe. Q: But that's many years later, right? A: Yeah. Q: So at that time A: I would have liked to go and I didn't wa nt to like to go. Because what would I do there? I can't arrest the German s. And I don't want to find out who was a Nazi. I get in trouble, you know. But I went to Germany twice more afterwards. Q: We can talk about that in a minute, but right now it's as your part of the military government that I'm interested in. A: Yeah. Q: When you were already working there in that did you know that your parents had survived? A: When I went there? Q: When you were part of the military operation A: No. Q: the American you didn't know then? A: No. Q: No. Were you looking to find out what had happened? Interview with Sol Kohn 54 A: I made a very bad mistake. I was with the military government, I told you that? Q: Yes. A: At that time what I'm talking about now, they came around one day and asked me if I want to go to the town I was born in. And I should have gone . They would have give me a jeep. It was something unusual, you know? Q: Yeah. A: But I I knew my parents wouldn't be aliv e or any part of my family. So I didn't go. But then about 20 years ago, I we nt with my wife to Germany. Q: So that would have been already the '80s, the '90s? A: We are not talking about wartime now. We are talking about later on. Q: Yeah, decades later. A: Yeah. So they gave me the opportunity. Q: But it was too difficult? A: I think that was very nice that they asked me. I was with the 28th Infantry Division, First Army. Q: Did you ever interrogate anybody who was a very high, important official, either in the military or on the civilian side? A: Arrested somebody or met somebody? Q: Um hum. A: Not really. Not the top people. Q: Any middle leve l type of people? A: Well, when I was with the 28th Infantry Division I dealt mostly with civilians. Interview with Sol Kohn 55 Q: Okay. Okay. A: Military government, assigned to the division. Every division had a military government section. Q: I see. A: And I worked for a major. I was his interpreter. Q: What was the major's name, do you remember? A: Yeah. Stanton. Q: Stanton? A: I remember that. Major Stanton. He lived in Syracuse, I know that. He was born there. Q: Okay. How is it your military experience in general, would you say it was a positive one? Did you feel if you stopped being German when Hitler came to power and everything changed, is there a poi nt when you became an American? A: I was an American. Q: You felt already an American? A: Yeah. Because you entered the army, a few months they made me a citizen. Q: That's what I was going to ask you. A: You had to live in this country for five years to become a citizen. But I was drafted in the army. I came here in '38. I was drafted in '42. So I wasn't here five years. But I sooner got in the army a few months later, I became a citizen. I was sworn in, in Michigan, I remember that. In Kalamazoo, Michigan. Q: You were sworn in, in Kalamazoo, Michigan? Interview with Sol Kohn 56 A: Yeah. I became a citizen. Q: You became a citizen? A: A citizen there. Q: Was there basic training? A: There was the camps there. Q: Aha, I see. A: An army camp where I had my basic training. Q: Okay. And A: So one day, they came around, put your uniform on. I didn't know what they want, when I was sworn in, they told me to. Q: So you were already you were an American? A: Yeah. Q: You were an American? A: I became American in the army. Q: Yeah, yeah. And inside too? A: I was an American the day I came here. Q: Got it. Got it. So how long were you, as part of the military government operation, in Germany after the war? A: I was with 28th Infantry Division. Q: Sure. Interview with Sol Kohn 57 A: But being that I speak German, they picked me right away not right, away a little later. And they assigned me to the military government section.

Did you finish your service A: Even after the war I stayed in Mannheim. Q: Oh, really? A: Yeah. Q: So you didn't go back to the United States after the war? A: My division, the 28th Infantry Division Interview with Sol Kohn 58 Q: Yes? A: you know about division and all that? Q: That's right.

Q: Not too many people did, yeah. A: The thing is, maybe I didn't have such a good education. They picked the best interpreters they could at that time, I guess. Not always you appl y for a job and you get it. Q: That's true. That's true. So but you di d get a civilian job as an interpreter after the war with the military government? A: No. Q: Oh, you didn't? A: No. Q: I thought you said you did? A: I was with the military government in a division. Q: I see. A: So when the war ended in 1946 Q: '45. A: '45, the division was sent to the Stat es, I imagine for the purpose to go to Japan eventually. Q: That's right. A: That's what I was told. Q: Okay. A: And I got out of division, applied for a job in for military government in Germany. Interview with Sol Kohn 61 Q: And did you get it? A: No. Q: Okay. So what did you do? A: I was an interpreter. Q: I mean what did you do after you didn't get the job? A: They assigned me to another unit, military government unit. Q: Oh, I see. So you applied for the job and then you didn't ge t it and then you were assigned to another A: Yeah. In the army. Q: In the army. And how long did you stay there doing that?

A: And I heard that we would be reassigned to the Pacific. Q: Got it. Okay. A: I had enough. Q: You didn't want to be there anymore.
